`After being forced into a marriage she hadn't wanted,`
` Natsuhi developed a grudge against the Ushiromiya family, and was filled with a desire for revenge.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 3)`
`Natsuhi, also hoping to take revenge for the financial submission her parents' family had been forced into by the Ushiromiya family, `
`schemed to capture the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 4)`
`Knowing that the wealth of the Ushiromiya family was, practically speaking, controlled by Kinzo personally,`
` she initiated sexual relations to curry favor with him and managed to ensnare him.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 7)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 682)`
`To curry favor with Kinzo, `
`Natsuhi repeatedly disguised herself as Beatrice, the witch of Kinzo's delusions, and engaged in sexual acts.`
` Kinzo saw Natsuhi dressed as the mistress from his past and was easily ensnared.`
` Furthermore, by accident, she was sometimes witnessed in this outfit by the servants, and this became part of the foundation for the legend of the witch.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 8)`
`(*From presented evidence #17)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 802)`
`However, late at night on October 4th, 1986, Ushiromiya Battler discovered the hidden gold.`
` Because the relatives were in an uproar and decided that Battler should succeed the headship, Natsuhi planned the crime.`
` She murdered the children in the so-called 'cousin room' and tried to frame Battler for the crime.`
` Furthermore, Genji was murdered because he was opposed to this scheme.`
` Later on, Hideyoshi was also murdered.`
` From this point on, she displayed the strong intent to indiscriminately murder all those involved.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 27)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials B: Page 61)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 1103)`
`The following outlines the details of the crime.`
` 24:00, October 4th, 1986.`
` Natsuhi decided to commit the crime.`
` Because Genji refused to assist her when she asked, she murdered him.`
` She then murdered her husband Krauss in his own room.`

`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 8)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 1105)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Afterwards, she went to the so-called 'cousin room' on the second floor of the guesthouse,`
` waited for Rosa to join the rest, and killed George, Jessica, Maria, and Rosa.`
` She damaged the necks of those corpses.`
` Afterwards, because there were people in the lounge on the first floor, she waited in an empty room on the second floor.`
` She hid in this empty room until the people in the lounge dispersed and went to bed.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 41)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 10)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 1131)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`The people in the lounge dispersed just after 3:00 AM.`
` Natsuhi left the empty room and escaped from the guesthouse.`
` She returned to her personal room, where she met up with Kinzo, who had been hiding there.`
` She stayed there until morning.`
` Kinzo left the room early next morning and concealed himself somewhere near the guesthouse.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 41)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 29)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 1200)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Afterwards, Kinzo saw his chance and carried off the corpses of the six victims one by one, hiding them.`
` Unfortunately, these hidden corpses have not been found.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 42)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials S: Page 37)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Natsuhi, who had failed in her scheme to cast suspicion on Battler, changed her plan to include the murder of all present.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 58)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials T: Page 19)`
`(*From the Bernkastel Documents: Page 1348)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`Predicting that one of those present would eventually want to take a rest in a private room,`
` Natsuhi concealed herself inside a closet in one of the guest rooms.`
` At 1:00 PM, she murdered Hideyoshi after he entered that room.`
`(*From the Trial Synopsis: Page 61)`
`(*From Supplemental Materials T: Page 26)`
`(*From the Great Court's Internal Documents: General Affairs A09 #9974)`
`From the time the others became aware of the incident to the time that they carried Hideyoshi's corpse out, Natsuhi once again concealed herself in the closet.`
` Furthermore, as proof of this, a button from Natsuhi's clothes was found in the closet.`
` Afterwards, she exited the closet and tried to return to her own room.`
` However, Furudo Erika found and questioned her first, and she confessed to the crime.`

`Great Court Official Notice #01724434`
`Due to the result of Illusion Trial #0147-007982 (24:00, October 5th, 1986), we announce that the following has been determined:`
`That Ushiromiya Natsuhi did admit to her crime.`
` For the 13 months following this announcement, related documents may be perused at the Great Court Legal Offices Document Management Center, First Subsection.`
` Great Court Deputy Chief`
` Head Inquisitor of Heresy`
` Dlanor A. Knox`
`"Then just say that I did it, okay?!`
` That's what you want me to say, right?!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!"`
`As though she had given up and decided that it would be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer,`
` Natsuhi oba-san said that and screamed.`
`......It was a sad incident.`
` I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances which led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family,`
` ......Natsuhi just might have been able to grasp a sliver of happiness together with Krauss oji-san and Jessica.`
`......However, by Natsuhi oba-san's own doing, Krauss oji-san, `
`......and even her beloved daughter Jessica, `
`......had been heartlessly killed...`
` It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the corpses...`
` However, judging by the clear testimony given by several people who knew him, `
`Grandfather's mental state for these last few years has been far from what anyone would consider normal.`
` Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago,`
` ......Grandfather might truly have believed that Natsuhi oba-san was a reincarnation of Beatrice.`
` Where is Grandfather now? `
`Like Erika had theorized,`
` did he really believe that he could revive Beatrice by carrying out murders following the epitaph,`
` and succumb to Natsuhi's cajolery?`
`......Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ceremony with the bodies he carried away......?`
`"Are you.........`
`......satisfied now.........?`
` ......This, `
`......is what you wanted to make me say, right......?"`
`Natsuhi oba-san sobbed as she spoke.`
`"......This is, `
`.........your revenge, isn't it......? `
`You, the man from 19 years ago...!!"`
`This 'man from 19 years ago' that Natsuhi oba-san kept mentioning was supposedly someone who had caught her in some sort of trap.`
` However, she had only mentioned that this man from 19 years ago existed,`
` and she most certainly hadn't tried to explain what had happened 19 years ago...`
`"I'm sure, ......that man's underling is one among us here.`
` ......I'm sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..."`
`".........Then tell me...!`
` Are you happy now?`
` Has a bit of that pain and suffering you've endured for 19 years gone away...?! `
`.........I finally understand.`
` ...The reason you've cornered me so far, ......is because, ......you wanted to make me acknowledge that, right......?"`
`"......Natsuhi-san.`
` Other than us, there's absolutely no one here.`
` Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn't exist actually does."`
`Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Natsuhi oba-san looked at us...`
`......No, as she looked at some being behind us, ......she hung her head and shook.`
` Then, .........she confessed to her sin.`
`"I, .........committed murder......"`
`"So, you've finally acknowledged your crime directly."`
`"No,`
` this is not about what has happened today and yesterday.`
` .........I will confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago."`
`The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about.`
`......Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago.`
`"N, ......19 years ago,`
` ......I, .........committed a sin.`
` .........I couldn't forgive it.`
` ......That, .........baby...!!"`
`"Baby?`
` Now what are you talking about?"`
`"......On that day 19 years ago, `
`...Father entrusted me with a baby.`
` .........Since I still couldn't bear a successor on my own, Father told me to adopt a child,`
` ......and he made me hold a baby which he said had been brought here from an orphanage..."`
`"Do you have any idea, ......how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!"`
`With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance, `
`Natsuhi oba-san confessed.`
` The humiliation as a woman that she was no longer expected to bear a child.`
` And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to hold an unfamiliar baby.`
` It caused her great sadness and rage,`
` and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart......`
` And then, ......I sold my soul to demons...`
`.........It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby...`
`......I wanted to be alone,`
` ......but that female servant holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere.`
` I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ......and therefore unable to escape from the child's crying......`
`.........That day...`
` marked the beginning of 19 long, headache-filled years......`
`.........Then, we faced the cliff from across the fence.`
` If by taking that baby, `
`......and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me`
`......I could undo it all...`
`......I really did listen to that demon's temptation.`
`"Then, .........for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that,`
` ......and lent an ear to that temptation.`
` ......At that time-"`
`The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered......`
` She leaned against the rough fence, ......and at that time, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly.`
` I told her to look out and tried to grab her shoulder.`
`"......No, `
`......I shouldn't be so vague...`
` I'll repent.`
` I'll confess.`
` .........At that moment, I'm sure that......as I told her to look out,`
` ............with both hands, `
`I reached for that servant's shoulder, `
`and with a thud, `
`......pushed her away hard......"`
`The rough fence snapped from the base,`
` .........and the servant, `
`......along with the baby held in her arms,`
` .........fell down towards the rocky beach below......`
` Even though...`
`...I remember that moment vividly,`
` ...for some reason I recall a vague...`
`...and very strange feeling.`
` It almost felt as though instead of falling,`
` ......the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space.`
` So I didn't even hear the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach.`
` No, I'm sure I heard it.`
` But because I wanted to think that they'd disappeared,`
` ......I must have erased that sound from my memory...`
`".........A, .........and then.........?"`
`"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream.`
` ......It was high enough that I couldn't see the two of them below me just by leaning over.`
` So I didn't know whether them falling...or the few seconds before that...had actually happened or not..."`
`I must have been wishing that the child would fall from here so much `
`that I just had a daydream...`
` Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden.`
` ......Then I decided to let the servant take care of the baby, choosing to take a rest alone in the garden...`
`......Then, `
`.........Father asked what had happened to the baby, `
`............`
`.........And an uproar began over the disappearance of the servant `
`who had been in charge of the baby.........`
` Eventually, the broken fence was discovered,`
` .........and the two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff...`
`......The child had been here for reasons that couldn't become known, so its existence was hushed up,`
` ......and the official story was that the servant had had an accident on her own and died.`
` That's right.`
` I......stole away two innocent lives in one go.........`
` As for the poor servant......her family was graciously compensated.`
` Her aged husband, who didn't know the truth, accepted this even though he grieved over the unfortunate accident.`
` Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, .........and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing.`
`".........But until this day...`
`......I have never apologized to that baby.`
` ......Yes, `
`.........that's what you're after, isn't it......?"`
`"So right here, right now, I'll confess to my crime!`
` ......I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`.........did 19 years ago...`
`......push you off a cliff...`
`...and try to kill you......"`
`......But, `
`......you didn't die, did you......`
`.........You're still alive, `
`......and you still call me 'Mother'...`
`.........You came to this island, `
`.........and took your revenge on me, didn't you......`
` For these 19 years...`
`......You knew that the one you should have called your mother pushed you off a cliff,`
` ......and you must have lived a very hate-filled life...`
`"......And now, ......you've taken everything I've gained since pushing you off that cliff,`
` 18 years of my life, ......and smashed it all to pieces...`
`......I no longer have my beloved husband and daughter. `
`......And I've lost even my honor, `
`......and am being called a murderer...`
`.........No, ......I really am a murderer, aren't I......"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......It all went according to your plans.`
` ......I'm now regarded as a killer...`
`............How's that...? `
`Is this enough...`
`...for your revenge......?`
` My husband and daughter have been killed, `
`......I've been made to look like a murderer......like an adulteress even......`
` After seeing me living in disgrace like this,`
` ............are you satisfied......?!`
` Yes, I'll bet you're quite satisfied...`
`......Because my family...`
`...my honor...`
`......everything.........has been stolen from me......`
`......Ooohh, `
`...*hic*......`
` gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!"`
`".........After all this, do you still claim that you were framed? `
`Seriously, you just don't know when to give up."`
`"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed child from 19 years ago...!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!`
` You've stolen everything from me now!!`
` What else could you want?! `
`......Please, `
`......just, `
`.........forgive me........."`
`{a:c: `
`"......It's useless, isn't it..."}`
`"Huh.........?"`
`".........Battler-san,`
` did you say something?"`
`{a:c: `
`"It's all useless."}`
`".........B, `
`.........Battler......ku......n......?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...It's useless, isn't it...`
` It's all useless......"`
`"Ah......`
`.........aaahhhh...............!!"`
