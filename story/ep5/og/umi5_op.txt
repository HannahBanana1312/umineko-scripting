`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!`
` It'll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else?!!`
` Kuhyahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look look, look look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look look, look look look look! `
`Gyahhahhahahaha!!"`
`"......Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty interesting.`
` ...Still, I was just trying to do what Teacher told me, but it really did work very well! `
`No matter what, after acting bad-tempered and exploring the depths of cruelty, by acting properly incompetent and soft, you get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, ri-ght? `
`Kyahahahahahaah!!"`
`That lonely tone was the sound of the desolate wind blowing by.`
` The color of the glittering flower petals on the rose bushes was...that of gold.`
` The group of gold butterflies which had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals...`
` could no longer be seen anywhere...`
` The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` She could be called inhumane and cruel.`
` Arrogant and outrageous.`
` And also, naive and simple.`
` That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard.`
` The Golden Witch Beatrice...`
` sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden.`
`......She wasn't relaxing there.`
` Her eyes were empty.`
` She didn't respond to any questions.`
` Even so, she was not permitted to sleep.`
` Beatrice sat like a doll......`
` Her hair was down, and Virgilia was carefully fixing it up with a comb.`
` If she had been complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle,`
` then it would have been clear that she was the usual Beato.`
`......However, she made no response, and showed no reaction.`
` So instead, it only looked like Virgilia was combing the golden hair of a large doll...`
` Alongside them, there was a table.`
` On it was a chessboard...along with a mix of black and white pieces in an all-out battle.`
` However, something about this setup looked different from normal chess.`
`...It might have been a game similar to chess but not identical.`
` And on the other side, ......sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man.`
`...No, perhaps he wasn't thinking of his next move.`
` Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation each time he changed it.`
` Maybe he was reconstructing previous arrangements, trying to discover the thought process behind those moves.`
` In the past...`
` Kinzo, the Ushiromiya family head, once likened learning chessboard arrangements to taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters.`
` Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey.`
`――A journey in search of the Golden Witch's thought process...which had led her to create this arrangement and make these moves.`
` Battler took a black piece which should have been moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply.`
` Battler's pieces were white.`
` However, on that chessboard, Battler's side was the black encampment.`
` He was reconstructing that arrangement, trying to play Beato's side...`
`"......The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."`
`Even Battler...didn't expect that Beato would respond to that statement.`
` No, ......thinking that there might still be a chance of her responding, `
`...he had spoken that as though talking to himself.`
` Beato's eyes, ......reflected nothing.`
` And her mouth told nothing.`
`"........................"`
`After begging him to kill her,`
` ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse which had given up on living.`
` She wasn't sleeping.`
`......She could not step down from this game and was therefore forbidden sleep.`
` So she must have heard.`
` However, ......the words probably hadn't reached her heart.`
` Right now, the Golden Witch would not sneer at Battler's moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them.`
` Beatrice was no longer......anything more than a living doll.`
` Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless.`
` Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture or even move her lips.`
` However, her movements were never able to communicate anything to Battler......`
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation? `
`......I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`"....................."`
`"......Beato.`
` Battler-kun is talking to you..."`
`"....................."`
`"...Say something.`
` Try giggling or guffawing.`
` ......I don't even care if you use that shrill laugh of yours."`
`......Can it be believed...? `
`That shrill laugh of Beato's...will never be heard again.`
` However, even if she couldn't answer, his voice surely reached her.`
`......Battler had spoken because he believed this.`
` So he said the same thing one more time...`
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation?`
` I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`"............`
`......So, you don't understand what this child is thinking?"`
`Virgilia answered in her disciple's stead.`
` Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato.`
` After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and Virgilia didn't want to be the one to steal that chance away.`
`......So, Battler would have to bear with this silence...`
`...until Beato herself answered.`
` Virgilia could no longer bear to watch Battler like this...`
` Furthermore, Battler wanted to have a conversation with Virgilia.`
` They believed that this would reach Beato's heart......`
`"Yep.`
` I don't have a clue.`
` ......The more I try standing in Beato's shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."`
`A serial murder following an epitaph.`
` With that as a victory condition, I tried reconstructing the arrangement from the perspective of the witch's side, `
`......but I just couldn't make it fit with Beato's moves.`
` In past arrangements, I could see several incomprehensible moves that clearly conflicted with that victory condition...`
`"......I don't get it at all.`
` This journey through her thinking process is just too rugged."`
`"Even so, you won't give up, will you."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I promised."`
`{a:c: 
`Kill...me.`
` ......Let me die......}`
`"I promised to let her die peacefully.`
` ......And I'm the only one who can do that."`
`...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.`
` It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement.`
` However, it symbolized restriction.`
` It was a visualization of the restriction that prevented her from leaving the game without either victory or loss...`
` And, the shackle was probably...hurting her.`
` The mercilessly cold shackle `
`tormented her over and over inside her waking dream.`
`"............Ghh............ah..."`
`So no relief appeared in her empty expression.`
` Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a bad dream, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.`
` Unless I win,`
` ......Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from sleeping peacefully...`
`"...Are you not in a hurry?`
` It seems that the 5th game has already started."`
`"............`
`......I'm not interested."`
`Why should I take part in any game without Beato as an opponent...? `
`If that's the only alternative,`
` then reconstructing previous arrangements while taking a journey in search of Beato's thought process is a much better use of my time......`
`"I'll be the next Game Master.`
` Any objections?`
` You've got none, right?"`
`"......I have tons of them.`
` Beato conceded the fight and is unconscious.`
` Isn't this loss by default and 'game over' for her...?"`
`"I'll admit that a lot's happened to Beato, and it feels like she's been knocked out right now. `
`But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight.`
` That's why I'm acting as her assistant.`
` Get it?"`
`Beato was lying down on the deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.`
` However, she wasn't sleeping,`
` ......and she wasn't awake either.`
` She was nothing more than a living doll that had given up on victory, who had asked Battler to perform her last rites, `
`and who had surrendered everything...`
` Of course, if everyone just sat around, the next game...the 5th game would not be prepared.`
` So, Lambdadelta had succeeded Beato as the next Game Master `
`and proclaimed that she would prepare the next game.`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This game is between me and Beato.`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna just let you carry on without us."`
`"No one asked your opinion. `
`What'll you do, Bern?`
` Accept it? Or not?"`
`"..................`
`......Sure.`
` Go and succeed her position."`
`"What the hell...quit messing around.`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"`
`"Calm down.`
` Of course, when the player changes, then so will the moves. `
`There might be a lot of things that are confusing to you, `
`but even those might become some big hints, get it?"`
`"Who cares?!! `
`Quit saying whatever you want and deciding everything on your own!!"`
`".........Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right?`
` In that case, I think that changing the player might lead to some huge hints."`
`"That's none of your business!`
` This is our game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent in it.`
` I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!"`
`".........In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.`
` Can you...?"`
`"B, ...Beato won't be getting up for a while.`
` But there's no need for a new game.`
` Just the four games that she has already laid out are more than enough!"`
`"Even if there is to be a 5th game, it just needs to be something that Beato lays out and I challenge.`
` You two have absolutely nothing to do with this!"`
`Battler couldn't hide his irritation at these two witches called Lambdadelta and Bernkastel,`
` who had shown up after the game's start and who had started to try and continue it on their own...`
` It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato,`
` so high, in fact, that even Beato's teacher Virgilia couldn't even come close.`
` Battler had the feeling that he'd seen these two several times before.`
` However, this was the first time he had known their names and spoken to them directly.`
`"You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato.`
` That's why I'll prepare the next game!"`
`"We aren't so patient `
`that we're willing to wait however long we have to for Beato to regain consciousness.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`"............I don't like boredom.`
` It really ticks me off."`
`"We really don't care whether you get bored or not."`
`"Come on now.`
` Leave everything to this <perfect> Lambdadelta-sama, okay?`
` I'll take over as the Game Master. `
`DON'T WORRY, I won't play with too much 'certain perfection'.`
` Just like Beato, I'll prepare plenty of incomprehensible fakes, clues, and bonus hints.`
` I'll give you some big hints to help you understand Beato's world even more, okay?"`
`Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.`
` The two witches didn't flinch at all.`
`......One grinned.`
` The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.`
` The two of them just stared at me silently.`
` ...As though they were reproaching me.`
`"What's this?`
` Not satisfied?`
` Are you saying you'll step down from my 5th game?`
` Isn't that loss by default?"`
`".........Battler won't step down.`
` Of course he'll participate in the 5th game."`
`"Don't just decide that yourself!! `
`I'm not gonna play along with you two.`
` I don't give a shit!"`
`"Hmmm...`
`......Then it really is loss by default, right...?`
` The witch side wins this game.`
` Is it really alright to end this with the humans surrendering...?"`
`".........If you step down, then the game will end with your loss by default, get it?`
` .........If you want to make certain that your lonely sister will always meet with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, `
`that option is indeed open to you."`
`When Bernkastel mentioned Ange, .........Battler's expression changed instantly.`
`"Y, ......you bastard,`
` don't talk about Ange so casually......"`
`".........Because you have me, the Witch of Miracles Bernkastel, as your ally,`
` ...there exists the possibility of a miracle in which Ange's family might come home to her.`
` Well, even if you throw that chance away yourself and guarantee that Ange's endless futures will all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting too."`
`I vaguely understood what she was saying.`
` Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world.`
` And if I abandon that victory, ......then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.`
` For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,`
` I must keep on fighting...`
`"Nn, ...d, .........damn......"`
`".........What's wrong?`
` You look unsatisfied.`
` Did you already forget the anger you felt when your sister was turned into mincemeat......?`
` That spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red-hot pliers.`
` Make sure you watch closely this time, okay......?"`
`Bernkastel pointed the palm of her right hand upwards.`
`...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue-glowing crystal appeared there.`
`......A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,`
` ...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now.`
` If you looked deep into that crystal, ......that Fragment,`
` then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.`
` If you stared at it,`
` then you could surely see that scene where Ange.........gave up everything after 12 years of her life to finally reach her beloved brother,`
` ......only to have her entire body torn to bits while she was still alive. A scene of her death throes.`
`"D, ......damn...you........."`
`Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,`
` but as soon as he touched that which made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.`
` And then, as naturally as though she had been there from the beginning,`
` Bernkastel was leaning against a distant wall.`
`".........If you step down from the game,`
` this will become not just a Fragment, but a definite reality.`
` I won't be the one to create that future.`
` You'll do it yourself.`
` ......So decide, alright?`
` Figure out what you want to do with your beloved little sister's future."`
`Battler's fists shook with anger,`
` ......but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit Bernkastel.`
` This witch wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it, like a cat or a phantom.`
` And, ...she was telling the truth.`
` For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight.`
` Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` That's just like you, Be~rn.`
` You're even heartless when you threaten people. `
`...That's how it is, Battleer.`
` You aren't allowed to step down from the game board.`
` You and Beato are nothing more than pieces on the game board that exist to distract us from our boredom.`
` ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to sate our boredom."`
`"Well, this level of anger only makes for a cheap snack."`
`".........Like those curry-flavored potato wafers that sell at 30 yen for a pair."`
`""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""`
`"Y, you damn......witches......"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Fight for Ange's sake, okay?`
` And for Beato's too, right...?"`
`In a way that was admonishing, ...or perhaps babying,`
` ......and similar to the way something too sweet sometimes gives you a headache, Bernkastel tormented Battler and smiled.`
` At this point in time, the host of this tea party, Beato, was absent.`
`......The guest witches were already making themselves at home.`
`"...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battleer?`
` Will you surrender to fate...?"`
`".................."`
`"Just step down.`
` You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right?`
` Eheheheheh, it sure is tough being one of Bern's pieces. `
`I'm sure she'll use you and throw you away just like she did with Ange.`
` Geheheheheh!"`
`"I'm not giving you the option of stepping down.`
` ......Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future. `
`I'm your ally.`
` Until you win, I'll support you so that you can reach that future...`
` for all eternity, until I get bored.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`I can't let her provocation and cajolery rile me up......`
` These witches know I get mad easily, and they're trying to take advantage of that...`
`...Battler withstood it all, ......and finally relaxed his clenched fists.`
`".........If you want to start this 5th game of yours, ...then just do it.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`"Yes, I will do whatever I want. `
`......Hey, where are you goi~ng?"`
`Even though Battler acknowledged this 5th game, he turned his back on them,`
` which surprised Lambdadelta a bit.`
`"If you're going to be Beato's substitute,`
` ......then I'm sure that Bernkastel witch over there can be mine if she wants."`
`".........Not a bad idea.`
` Otherwise, this'll turn into a loss by default."`
`"What the heck?!`
` Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!`
` Rude, ruuude!"`
`"......Battler says he's going to take a break for a while.`
` Until he comes back, I'll be the substitute player. `
`How's that sound...? Battler...?"`
`".........You do that."`
`"............"`
`"......What's wrong, Lambda?`
` So, you'll refuse to play if it's against me instead of that fool Battler...?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!!`
` Of course not♪`
` I'm glad I get to play with you, Be~rn! `
`Come on, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's play together in Lambdadelta-sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5~!"`
`".........Well, this really is a world that Beato created.`
` You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.`
` I made sure to use a Beato-ish atmosphere to make an even more interesting tale."`
`"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay?`
` It'd be a shame to miss this.`
` I've prepared plenty of bonus hints that'll get him closer to Beato's secre~t♪"`
`"...Is what it'll look like but I'll actually fill it with misdirection and make things more and more confusi~ng. `
`Wait, hey, Battleer! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!"`
`Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.`
` After shrugging and cackling,`
` the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......`
`"Can those witches really understand Beato's game?"`
`"...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.`
` However, they can do things that this child wouldn't do."`
`"............`
`...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?"`
`"The materials of chess exist so that you can play chess.`
` You 'cannot' use them to play cards.`
` However, things such as throwing the chess pieces at your opponent and scribbling on the board...`
` doing such things is not impossible.`
` However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,`
` so people 'don't do that'."`
`"....................."`
`That definitely, ......wouldn't be chess anymore.`
` It looked like Beato's eyes clouded very slightly with sadness.`
`".........Damn them.`
` .........This game is between me and Beato.`
` ...I won't let anyone else profane it."`
`At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove, holding a tea set with black tea, appeared.`
`"Would you like some more tea?"`
`".........If you wouldn't mind."`
`"Certainly.`
` ......So, `
`how has this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts been?"`
`"I don't have a clue, but I'm enjoying it."`
`"However, ......is this really alright?`
` Is it alright for you to relax here?"`
`"......You mean that game those witches just started all by themselves?"`
`"Yes.`
` Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,`
` and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."`
`When Beato and I were playing, `
`the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.`
`......However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around...`
`"............Ronove, did you see their game?"`
`"Just a part of it."`
`"How was it?"`
`Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.`
` After finishing that, he finally said one thing.`
` He let us hear his impression of it.`
`"It did not...have love."`
`"......What do you mean, love?"`
`"My apologies.`
` That's how it would be put if a woman were to say it. `
`......As a man, `
`......perhaps one could say it was dishonorable."`
`I understood what those words meant.`
` When I met Virgilia's eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...`
`".........At a glance, I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly.`
` However, the foundation is very different."`
`"Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?"`
`"No, it does not.`
` Lambdadelta-sama actually does understand the rules of Milady's game quite well.`
` ......However..."`
`".................."`
`Battler stood up.`
` There was no need to make Ronove say any more.`
`"Battler-kun......"`
`"......Sorry, Ronove.`
` I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need."`
`"So, you will go after all?"`
`"Yeah. `
`......We don't need any outsiders in our game."`
`...These guys weren't even here in the beginning.`
` Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,`
` ......and now they've hijacked this game between me and Beatrice.`
`"I've got to take it back.`
` ......Now, I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board.`
` ...That means I shouldn't just sit around here."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I wanted to let this child hear those words."`
`"I'm sure she hears them.`
` ......Milady is simply unable to answer."`
`Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...`
` The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...`
` If I was designated to be her opponent...`
`...Then Beato must have created this game for me.`
` I've......got to take it back.`
`"......Wait here.`
` I'll go and take it back."`
`"....................."`
`Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way.`
`......That's right.`
` If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.`
`"I'll be right back.`
` ......Virgilia, Ronove.`
` ...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping princess."`
`"Yes. Leave it to us."`
`"......See you later, Battler-kun.`
` And please,`
` ......in the game without this child, try to find some part of her.`
` If you can,`
` ......then even if this child is absent, it will mean that you have fought with her."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...Aaah, `
`......it's all useless.`
` What am I doing?"`
`Let's go.`
` ...And let's take it back.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!`
` My break is over!!"`
`When he faced the jet-black heavens and yelled this, `
`the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.`
` Then, ......as though it had been that way since the beginning,`
` .........it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.`
`"What do you think you're doing?`
` You're only coming back now?`
` It's way too late!`
` Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale, get i~t?!"`
`".........You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."`
`Yeah, like you ever even waited for me in the first place...`
`"Bern was waaay more skillful and thrilling than you were. Right?!"`
`"Shut up.`
` I'm the player.`
` You substitute witches can just take a step back now."`
`".........Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore."`
`"Seriously.`
` After all, we're already at the climax!`
` After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."`
`"What the hell.........?!"`
`".........Nothing wrong with that, is there?`
` Why don't we let him watch the final endgame?"`
`"Of course.`
` Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made! `
`Episode 5.`
` End of the `
`Golden Witch! `
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.`
` And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.`
` And, the culprit is among these people.`
`"......Whoa, whoa.`
` ...In that case, ...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"`
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."`
`"............It was you?! `
`You killed George, killed my husband?!`
` Why?!!`
` Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!"`
`"I, ...I didn't kill anyone...!`
` I, I, d, didn't do...!!"`
`"....................."`
`In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn't be called flowing,`
` ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Natsuhi oba-san denied the suspicion placed upon her...`
` However, ......there was no longer any way around it...`
` She stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Natsuhi oba-san and said it one more time.`
`"......You're the culprit.`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san."`
