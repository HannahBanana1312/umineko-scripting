`"......Father..., it's Natsuhi.`
` Good morning..."`
`"There's no way he'll wake up if you do it like that! `
`Father, it's Eva!`
` Please wake up! `
`It's an emergency!!"`
`Eva pushed Natsuhi aside and knocked repeatedly with all her strength.`
`"Q, quiet down...!!`
` You're being too boisterous...!"`
`"Is now really the time to be saying something like that?!?!"`
`"............So he isn't picking up the phone, and he isn't responding to knocking either?`
` That's troublesome."`
`"...H, ...he might be in a bad mood again...`
` Kinzo-san sometimes considers even the slightest change to be an omen`
` and gets into a bad mood for reasons only he can understand..."`
`"Hoh, ......hohoho...`
` Yes, that's true...`
` This isn't something that's started today..."`
`"Is that how badly Grandfather wants to shut himself away in the study?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......It's not uncommon for him to stay in his study for more than a month at a time..."`
`"......Don't tell anyone, ......but even though I work here,`
` I sometimes forget that the Master even lives here..."`
`"Gohda.`
` That's not the sort of thing a servant should be saying!!"`
`"M, my apologies, Madam..., I am truly sorry......"`
`"Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him?`
` In the worst case, Father might not even know that there was a crime! Right?!"`
`"......W, well, I wonder........."`
`Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled his words...`
`"............Who was the last person to meet Father...?`
` ......And when?"`
`"I, ...it was me.`
` Last night, `
`......up until the time of the uproar from when Battler found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."`
`".........So around 23:00 last night."`
`"......No way around it.`
` Let's open it up."`
`"Wh, what did you say...?!`
` This is the family head's precious study and research room!`
` No one is permitted to trespass without permission, okay?!"`
`"Who here holds the highest rank?`
` Me, right?!`
` I am the third in rank of the Ushiromiya family!`
` If we open it and get scolded by Father, that is also a responsibility to be taken up by the highest ranked. `
`Because of the urgent circumstances, we'll open this door.`
` You have a key, right? Open it."`
`"I, ......I believe you know this, but the study door cannot be opened with the master key."`
`"Umm, ......the Master has recently taken away Genji-sama's key as well,`
` so he has both keys on his person.`
` ......Therefore, umm......"`
`".........So, both of the keys that can open this door are inside the study."`
`"A closed room. `
`.........<Good>.`
` It's finally starting to get a little interesting.`
` ......It'd be pretty neat if Kinzo-san was `
`lying on the bed in there with his throat cut."`
`"That is too imprudent, Erika-san!!`
` A, ......anyway, as you know, this door can only be opened by the keys that Father has."`
`"......That means it's impossible for anyone, even a murderer, to even touch Father from outside the room!`
` So Father must be alright...!!"`
`"Still, that doesn't mean we don't have to worry about checking to see that he's safe.`
` Are you really so unconcerned about confirming the safety of the Father you respect so much......?"`
`".........Th, ......that isn't..."`
`The atmosphere, which had been so agitated a second ago, suddenly went cold......and an eerie feeling filled the room as everyone stared at Natsuhi.`
`......They could understand why Natsuhi would protect the study under normal circumstances.`
` It was understood that she probably didn't want to disturb the research of Kinzo, whom she respected,`
` and she was therefore trying to keep the unpleasant relatives away.`
` However, ......this was an extraordinary situation.`
` A murder had occurred.`
` Natsuhi's persistence in keeping things quiet for Kinzo even in a situation like this...`
` was hard to understand using common sense.`
`".........There's a good chance that the crime which has occurred on this island will turn out to be murders set up to follow the epitaph.`
` ......It's probably a good idea to assume that the crimes will continue."`
`"If we reconsider this as a series of murders following the epitaph, that means the crimes will continue further, resulting in a total of 13 lives being taken.`
` .........Do you have any concept of how many victims that would be?"`
`"......Wait a sec.`
` How many people do you think there are on this island?`
` ......Wouldn't that be almost everyone...?"`
`"Non non. You've got it all wrong.`
` .........As far as I know, the mystery novel with the most dead people in a serial murder `
`was 'And then there were none' by Agatha Christie, which had 10 deaths.`
` In the realm of Japanese mysteries, it's probably 'The Tokyo Zodiac Murders' by Shimada Souji.`
` Though there were less than 10 deaths in that one."`
`"......Did you know?`
` If 13 people die at this rate, it will lead to the most infamous and famous development in the history of the mystery genre,`
` the completion of a 13 person serial murder case, get it?`
` And if everyone on this island is killed...`
`...that would make it a historical achievement in the world of serial murder mysteries,`
` with even more deaths than the longest murder mystery in the world and the longest one in Japan put together, don't you see?!`
` ......Hey, didn't you know? Everyone?"`
`"The culprit in this crime...`
`...is giving us an incredible challenge, one that might even surpass all the mysteries throughout the world and throughout history. `
`......Of course, everyone's realized that long ago, right......?`
` If you like mystery, Christie's a must-read.`
` If you're Japanese, then it's only natural that you've read Shimada Souji's works all the way through. `
`......Are you sure you've been reading enough, everyone?`
` *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*........."`
`"............That's no good."`
`"Huh.........?"`
`"Looks like you haven't read enough yourself."`
`"Did I say something wrong...?"`
`Erika, who had been chatting away happily all by herself up until a second ago,`
` changed her expression into a displeased glare in an instant...`
`"It's what you were saying about the Japanese mystery genre.`
` ......Sakaguchi Ango's 'Non-serial Murders' beats 'The Zodiac Murders'."`
`"...............ah. `
`...............Th,`
` .........the number of people was the same in both, right?"`
`"They tie for the record, but 'Non-serial Murders' was first published in 1947. 'The Zodiac Murders' was 1981.`
` ......If you know so much about it, shouldn't you have mentioned 'Non-serial Murders' first?"`
`"............Nn, `
`...............gah."`
`Erika glared at Battler with an expression that couldn't be fully described with the word 'shock',`
` and her arms shook as she stood there, lost for words......`
`"Ahahahahahahaha, kyaahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's so totally laaame!!"`
`"Well, that's understandable.`
` The crimes in 'Zodiac' took place in 1936, right?`
` That must have gotten her confused, right? `
`Aaahhihihihihihihihhyahahahaahh!!"`
`Lambdadelta kept on hitting the table, overcome with laughter.`
` Even Bernkastel, who had been struck with humiliation, `
`snorted and started pounding the table and laughing in the same way.`
`"Pfft, `
`..........hihihihihhahahahahahaah!! `
`This is just too good!! `
`Giihihihihihihihihihihiii!! `
`.........Not bad, Battler's piece. `
`Gahihihihihyahahhaahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`".........I'm impressed.`
` ......You must read a lot, ......don't you, Battler-san?"`
`"Books?`
` I don't read those at all."`
`".........You liar. `
`......You know...`
`...quite a lot, don't you?"`
`"I'd never say something as arrogant as 'I read books'.`
` ......'I read books' isn't something a person who only reads about a hundred per year should say so lightly, `
`don't you think......?"`
`"Y, ......you mere......piece........."`
`"Ah, ......*cough*. `
`...A, anyway, we can't let such a massive crime take place...!!"`
`"That's right.`
` At any rate, checking Dad's safety is our first priority right now. `
`But what should we do?`
` He's ignoring the phone and our knocking. The keys are inside.`
` There's nothing we can do.`
` Are we supposed to knock this thick door down?`
` ......That won't be easy."`
`"Father might have been attacked by someone and severely injured, and maybe he's waiting for someone to help him.`
` ......This is an extraordinary circumstance.`
` Even Father will understand.`
` And if he has any rebuke, I'd be happy to take responsibility myself."`
`".........B, but...`
` breaking down a door would be...`
` qu, quite rude......"`
`"What about the window.........?"`
`"Th, ......that's right.`
` The window.`
` ......Is there a ladder somewhere which can reach up to a third floor window?`
` We should be able to go inside by smashing the window...!"`
`Erika finally came back to her senses and her tone regained its decisive edge.`
`"The third story window...th, that would be dangerous......"`
`"We won't know unless we try.`
` Is there a ladder around here that can reach up three floors?"`
`"I don't think the ladder in the gardening shed is long enough......"`
`"......Oh, then what about the ladder in the boiler room?`
` I remember using it earlier when a bird made a nest on top of the rain gutter...! `
`Yes, that would be able to reach without a doubt."`
`He must have been extremely happy about thinking of something Kanon hadn't.`
` Looking pleased with himself as though he had won something, he glanced around at everyone.`
` He was probably hoping that Natsuhi would praise him, but she quickly avoided his gaze...`
` Of course, Kanon had known about that ladder too.`
`......However, in order to protect Kinzo's secret, he had intentionally pretended to have forgotten......`
`"But with this weather and the strong winds...`
` Isn't this just too dangerous......?"`
`"I agree.`
` Even if someone gets seriously injured, we can't go to a hospital until tomorrow, right...?!"`
`"......The wind might not be as strong in the courtyard.`
` I think it's at least worth it to take a look."`
`"But seriously, going up to the third floor will be quite a challenge...!`
` Back when we had to clean up the bird's nest, most of the servants shrank away from the danger, `
`and that's when I, your humble servant, took on a major role in spectacularly handling the situation.`
` Uhahahahahahahaha...!"`
`"Right, then there's no problem!`
` Let's just get a ladder that'll reach-"`
`"And it looks like someone here already has experience with this sort of thing."`
`".........Hahahahahaha, `
`.........huh?"`
`Because the courtyard was surrounded on all four sides, while the rain was fierce, the winds had almost no effect.`
` Fortunately, the ceiling jutted out a bit, so even the rain wasn't so bad.`
`"Alright.`
` Let's try standing the ladder up. `
`......Be careful.`
` Don't hurt yourself."`
`"Sure..."`
`Rudolf and Battler carried the special ladder, which was designed for work on high places.`
` Two umbrellas followed the pair.`
` Shannon and Kanon were holding umbrellas and sheltering them from the rain.`
`"It doesn't matter if we get wet.`
` Go back under the eaves. `
`......Gohda-san!`
` Even if there's something wrong with your knees, you can at least hold a ladder down, right?!"`
`"Y, yes yes yes yes...!`
` If only I had enough Hyaluronan, going up a ladder would be no problem at all......I am truly sorry..."`
`Gohda clambered forwards to replace Shannon and Kanon.`
` As she watched this, Kyrie giggled.`
`"Dad, hammer."`
`"Cool.`
` ......Battler, you love athletics, don't you?"`
`"Not as much as I love my cool handyman of a Father♪"`
`"You little brat. `
`.........Sheesh, I guess I need to show this son of mine my good side every once in a while.`
` Battler, Gohda-san.`
` Hold that ladder down tight.`
` And make sure you're looking up, okay?`
` My hand might slip and you'll have this hammer tumbling down on you."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll catch it and smash your head in."`
`After putting the hammer they had gotten to smash the window in his pocket and cracking his knuckles,`
` Rudolf started climbing the ladder......`
`"Will Rudolf-sama......be alright......?"`
`"He will be.`
` That guy could totally be in an action movie.`
` Plus, sports are one of his strong points."`
`"......I wish you'd tell me how my skating prowess is supposed to help me climb ladders...`
`......♪I am Ina Bauer, always in a big pi~nch...or whatever."`
`"He'll manage to avoid dying, so there's nothing to worry about. `
`......More importantly, we're really lucky that the shutters aren't down.`
` Isn't it a common practice to lower the shutters to Father's study for the night?"`
`"Y, yes.`
` When we're permitted to enter and exit, we open and close them in the morning and at night."`
`"......However, I think it was decided that such a thing was unnecessary for the time being, so it was left open."`
`"I see.`
` ............Father will be pretty mad, won't he?`
` ...If his son smashes his window and comes in while he's sleeping."`
`"......That's...probably......"`
`"It would be wonderful if we didn't have to smash the window, don't you think?"`
`"..............."`
`Both Shannon and Kanon...knew that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.`
` Natsuhi had ordered them to interfere as much as possible,`
` ......but now that it had come to this, there was nothing that the two of them could do.`
`......They had tried to interfere by pretending that they didn't know about the ladder that could reach up to the third floor window, but...`
` Because of Gohda's showing off, that ladder had been found...`
` Rudolf carefully climbed the ladder.`
`......He would reach the third floor window very soon.`
` As he did this...`
`...Shannon and Kanon stared at him, looking uneasy......`
` After this......what will happen next? `
`To the two of them.`
` To Madam.`
`......To the Master.`
`......Very soon, Rudolf will reach the window.`
`"......So, it's already the end for this room's barrier."`
`"Hahah.`
` The soldiers are scaling the ramparts, trying to reach the other side.`
` The moment of surrender is truly right before our eyes.`
` .........I am prepared to be erased at any moment."`
`"We can't let that happen.`
` You have to remain alive, even if it means eating dirt.`
` ......Think about what happens next.`
` Escape from this place for now."`
`"You may say that, but what can I do?`
` ......Eva and the rest are still camped out in the hallway and Rudolf is approaching the window.`
` There's no way of retreat through the door or the window."`
`"In that case, perhaps you could hide under the bed."`
`"......Hmph.`
` So I am not even permitted the chance to wait for the enemies' arrival in my throne?"`
`"You might have done that while you were still alive.`
` However, you are now a ghost that Natsuhi and I brought to life.`
` Ghosts should do what ghosts do best and hide under the bed or in a closet."`
`"Will something like that really deceive their eyes...?`
` My, my."`
`".........Don't worry.`
` I'll be with you.`
` I'll let you escape at the last moment."`
`"It'll be dangerous for you.`
` Even though you're a demon, you won't get away unscathed if you're burned by the magic-resisting toxin."`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` .........Anyway, I need things to get at least that bad before my heart starts pumping."`
`"How comforting.`
` ......I understand.`
` I'll hide under the bed."`
`".........Milady.`
` Rudolf will reach the window very soon."`
`"Gaap.`
` I've changed my mind. I'll guard this place.`
` Hide yourself along with Ronove."`
`"What did you say...?`
` You've got it backwards.`
` Didn't we plan to leave this place to Gaap and have you retreat, Milady?"`
`Even though Ronove should have been used to her fickleness, this surprised him for the first time in a long while.`
`......Though Beato was the powerful queen, she was also an important piece which mustn't be exposed to danger.`
` Though she was strong, running to the front lines without any plan would not be a praiseworthy move.`
`"What kind of whim is this...?`
` ..............."`
`"It's just a whim.`
` I'm not so fond of boredom that I could simply sip tea while leaving everything to you...! `
`I've just gotten the urge to jump into the struggle right away...!"`
`"...............`
`......I understand.`
` It is your game, after all.`
` You can do as you wish.`
` I'll carefully watch over the corpses of the first twilight that I erased to make sure that nothing happens to them."`
`"Sorry for stealing your time to shine."`
`".........Is this really alright, Milady?"`
`"You should know that I like standing out even more than my three meals a day.`
` I've done nothing except gobble up Gaap's turn.`
` Don't worry about it...!"`
`......Ronove and Gaap were both silent.`
` The two of them had already noticed.`
` Lady Bernkastel, who used Furudo Erika as a piece, was a terrifying opponent.`
`......This fight would probably be terrifying as well.`
` Beato couldn't expose Gaap, her friend, to this danger......`
` Beato bluffed and said that this wasn't the case,`
` but Ronove and Gaap had already figured it out.`
` Therefore, after confirming Beato's resolve one last time and seeing that she was completely firm in her decision,`
` ......they nodded in silence and accepted it.`
`"I understand.`
` ......I'll leave this place to you. I'm rooting for you.`
` .........Take care."`
`"Yeah.`
` Please watch over my efforts to your heart's content...!"`
`"......Lady Bernkastel will probably start trying to expose Kinzo's absence with a closed room argument. `
`......Fights in a closed room are normally Gaap's area of expertise.`
` ......Queens are the commanders because they are best at fighting in wide open areas.`
` ......This won't be an easy fight."`
`"I'm fully aware of that.`
` I currently serve Natsuhi.`
` Watching Natsuhi's danger from above and letting Gaap take care of it doesn't make sense to me."`
`".........Understood.`
` ......I wish you luck in your battle."`
`"Be careful...`
`......If it becomes a complete closed room, we won't be able to come in and help you."`
`"I'll laugh at them a bit, and if things get bad, I'll just grab Kinzo and run for it. `
`It's easy.`
` With the door and the window, the past and the future to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to.`
` Of course I won't let this become a closed room."`
`"......Though you won't see us, we'll be cheering you on from very close by.`
` ......Good luck."`
`"Sure."`
`Gaap and Ronove became a swarm of gold butterflies and disappeared,`
` and Kinzo melted into the darkness beneath the bed.`
` Then, Beato also became a swarm of gold butterflies and melted away inside the study...`
` After that, all figures and signs of life had disappeared from the study, and it once more regained a silence as though no one had been there from the beginning...`
` Then, ......Rudolf's outline slipped into view from beyond the window's curtain.`
`"Dad...!!`
` If you're there, answer!`
` Daaad!"`
`As he yelled, he hit the window.`
` His foothold was so uncertain that just hitting the window felt life-threatening.`
` But of course, this was Rudolf, the show-off.`
` Deciding that he couldn't do anything stupid with so many people watching from below, he suppressed the fear from being so high up...`
` and boldly knocked on the window.`
`".........Come on Grandfather...can't he hear...?"`
`"I, I wonder...`
` I hope he doesn't drop the hammer..."`
`"How many seconds have passed?"`
`"......It's been 30 seconds since he knocked on the window."`
`"So, `
`......he'll really...`
` sm, `
`......smash it? `
`Umm, the Master...will be very mad..."`
`"There's one person who's been kind enough to brag about how accepting that anger is her duty, so there's no need to worry. `
`......Rudolf-san!`
` That's enough. Do it...!"`
`"Sure...!`
` .........Dammit Dad, you better not complain after I smash it."`
`He hit it several times, and eventually, a fist-sized hole opened up in the glass.`
` Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort...`
` Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further,`
` stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window.`
` Then, after a hard struggle, Rudolf somehow managed to open the window, and his body slipped through into the study.`
` After that, he flopped onto the floor, using his entire body to enjoy the relief of having a ground under him.`
`".........Dad! It's Rudolf.`
` Answer me!"`
`It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.`
` A study.`
` A book archive.`
` A place to sleep.`
` And a bathroom and washroom.`
` It was divided into multiple rooms.`
`......That's right, with all this at your fingertips, it wouldn't be hard to spend your days in this study without leaving at all.`
` The bed was empty.`
` There were marks on it which made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight.`
`"......This happens a lot in ninja movies.`
` Someone finds that the bed is still warm, so the occupant couldn't have gone far."`
`Rudolf tried placing his hand on the bed, but he couldn't feel any heat at all.`
` Not only was there no heat......it felt completely ice cold.`
` And the bed wasn't the only thing that was ice cold.`
`......The air inside the room......and even the presence about it, if that's the right word for it...`
`...even that felt ice cold.`
` To Rudolf, it felt as though Kinzo had slipped out of this room a long time ago...`
`"......However, it's been well cleaned.`
` It has signs of having been lived in.`
` ..............."`
`Wrinkles in the bed.`
` The slight angle of the chair.`
` Here and there, there were many marks that would doubtlessly have been cleaned or fixed up if someone had come in to make the beds.`
`"As far as I can tell off the top of my head, Dad must have slipped out of bed several hours ago at the latest..."`
`That would be the same general time period as the brutal murder case.`
`......It looks like we really can't be sure that Kinzo's absence and the crime have nothing to do with each other.`
` For the time being, Rudolf leaned out of the window `
`and told Kyrie and the others in the courtyard to come back up since he was going to unlock the door.`
` Then, he pushed the button on the study desk and released the door's auto-lock.`
` There was a heavy clunking sound, and Natsuhi and the rest dashed in immediately...`
`"F, ......Father...... Good morning..."`
`"Sorry, but it isn't Dad.`
` ......I'm the one who opened it."`
`".........Was Kinzo-san there?"`
`"Nope.`
` ......It looks like someone slipped out of the bed, but you can't tell when that happened."`
`"And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...?`
` Around 11:00 last night.`
` I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."`
`"Th, ......that's......`
` B, but Father is a fickle person...`
` He used to sometimes say that he had a revelation in a dream all of a sudden, wake up in the middle of the night,`
` and walk around the mansion.`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"Nn, ......y, yes, such a thing has happened before...`
`...Anyway, ......umm, he is a fickle person. `
`R, right, Kumasawa-san...?"`
`"...Hoh, ...hohoho.`
` That's true...`
` He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed...`
` That happens a lot, yes......"`
`"Then where did he slip off to...?!`
` Does this mean...that there's a good chance Father's been caught up in this crime?!"`
`".........See?`
` We should have checked to make sure Father was safe from the beginning, right?"`
`"...Nn..............."`
`"We can't be sure he isn't in this room.`
` Maybe the culprit tied him up and locked him in the closet or something like that."`
`".........Good point.`
` Let's search."`
`"Th, ......this is the head's precious study...`
` You mustn't touch things without reason...!"`
`"Ah yeah, that's right, `
`There's something I need to tell you, culprit-san."`
`When Natsuhi heard this said from right in front of her, her heart froze.`
`......But Erika had only just happened to be standing right in front of Natsuhi when she said it.`
` She had directed her words to the room at large.`
`......She hadn't been speaking to Natsuhi in particular.........`
` Natsuhi turned her back on Erika, trying to make it so that her faltering expression wasn't noticed...`
`"......I have a photographic memory.`
` If you try to alter the crime scene by hiding some evidence, I'll know right away.`
` ......Please don't slip up here and disappoint me.`
` Don't you think that any mystery where the 'who dunnit' is solved by a culprit's slip-up or misspeak is only third-rate?"`
`".........I, ...I don't understand what you're saying, but try to refrain from incautious remarks. `
`......Father, are you there...?!`
` Please answer me...!"`
`Natsuhi started walking around and calling out in a loud voice, refusing to let Erika say any more.`
` There was a knock.`
` Kyrie and the others who had gone down to the courtyard had returned.`
`"So Father isn't here after all?"`
`"He might be tied up and shut away somewhere around here.`
` We were just searching for him."`
`".........I'm surprised he managed to shut himself away in a place like this for all that time."`
`".................."`
`"......Give it up, Nee-san.`
` ......We can't change anything now."`
`"I wonder......what Madam plans to do......"`
`"......Get paid back for all the lies she's told up until now."`
`".........Shh.`
` ...Let's leave fate in God's hands."`
`"Y......, ...yes......"`
`"............"`
`Many people clambered around Kinzo's vast study, looking here and there.`
` Inside the closet and in the bathtub.`
` Even in the refrigerator and under the study desk.`
`......They looked everywhere, almost as though they were 'it' in a game of hide-and-seek.`
`......However, not only were they unable to spot Kinzo, they couldn't even find a single suspicious mark...`
`"I, it seems clear that Father isn't here.`
` ......That's enough.`
` Please don't disturb Father's precious study any further."`
`"That's right, that's right...`
` There's nothing the Master hates more than having things moved around without his permission..."`
`"Father's nowhere to be found.`
` .........Maybe he really was caught up in the crime...?"`
`".........Th, though we can't be sure of that..."`
`Natsuhi averted her gaze once more.`
`"......It's alright, Natsuhi."`
`"......We truly do have our backs against the wall...`
` On the off-chance that someone entered the study, I had planned to trick them by saying that he had probably gone for a walk somewhere.`
` ......However..."`
`"Hmph.`
` No one would believe that I'd get dressed up for a casual midnight stroll in a mansion where a murder has occurred and many people have been killed.`
` Though I wouldn't put it past myself to do such a thing."`
`"Come now, Kinzo.`
` Be a good boy and hide under the bed. `
`......It's alright, Natsuhi.`
` You may remain calm.`
` .........You can prove that someone exists, but you can't prove that someone doesn't exist."`
`"In other words, the human world is one in which regardless of whether something exists or not, you can make it so that they 'exist'.`
` ......And the shadows which can make those things 'exist' form the world of us witches, the world of demons."`
`"......You mean...a Devil's Proof."`
`"Yes.`
` .........So don't worry.`
` The power of demons will most certainly protect you."`
`".........If it could protect the honor of Father and my husband, ...I wouldn't mind sacrificing this body of mine to demons."`
`"Your resolve is good.`
` ......Don't be anxious.`
` I most certainly won't let Kinzo be killed."`
`At that time, a dry sound suddenly rang out twice.`
` Erika had clapped her hands, seeking everyone's attention.`
` Though such an action should have been above a guest's place,`
` for some reason, it already felt like a natural right of hers.`
`......After all, she was the 'detective'.`
`".........I think that's enough.`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo-san is nowhere to be found in this study."`
`"Yeah, we've searched all the places where he could have been hiding.`
` Dad's nowhere to be seen."`
`"Furthermore, we've found nothing that looks suspicious."`
`"Yes, we didn't find anything at all."`
`Erika said it again.`
` They hadn't been able to discover anything......`
`"In that case, we mustn't loiter around this room.`
` Do you understand how angry Father would be if he learned that so many people were looking through his study...?! `
`Eva-san, `
`you said that you were prepared to take responsibility, didn't you?`
` Are you prepared for him to break off relations with you for the rest of your life...?!"`
`"Th, that's for Father to decide...!!`
` Not you!!"`
`"Silence, please.`
` .........I'd like to lay out the situation. `
`At 23:00 last night, the last person to meet Kinzo-san in this room was Natsuhi-san, right?`
` Can anyone confirm that?"`
`"......Confirm...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` After all, the only one who claims that Natsuhi-san really did stop by here at 23:00 last night is Natsuhi-san herself. `
`There wouldn't be a problem if Kinzo-san confirmed that Natsuhi-san really did come here last night,`
` but that vital witness isn't here."`
`".........So you're saying that alibis are the foundation of a mystery?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Alibis are important. `
`Of course, they're almost useless when it comes to the actual theory-making,`
` but it's common courtesy to poke around those boxes."`
`"Heh.`
` ......Even though you didn't ask for alibis regarding last night's murder, you are doing it for Grandfather's disappearance.`
` ...You really are a fickle person."`
`"Oh, don't worry.`
` Have no fear that I will fully examine everyone's alibis `
`regarding the murders of the first twilight later."`
`".........So, can anyone confirm that Natsuhi-san visited here at 23:00?`
` If no one can, we'll be forced to doubt whether Natsuhi-san really was the last person to spot him."`
`"......A, are you saying that I can't be trusted?"`
`"No, no, it's actually the opposite.`
` I hope that you aren't the culprit.`
` After all, that would make things reeeally boring. `
`Only the worst third-rate mysteries have the most suspicious person as the culprit."`
`"...Natsuhi-san......is suspicious?`
` W, wait a second.`
` How can you say that...?!"`
`"He's right...!`
` Calling Madam suspicious is the height of discourtesy...!!"`
`"Be quiet!! `
`Doctor Nanjo, Gohda, `
`thank you.`
` ......Erika-san.`
` ......Do you have enough proof to justify such a rude outburst......?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Though it's so simple that it annoys me.`
` Sorry to bother you with this TV drama-quality evidence, but if you don't mind..."`
`".........Why don't you just let us hear it?"`
`When Battler glared at her, ......a cold expression rose to Erika's face for an instant.`
` But it was only for an instant.`
` After smiling peacefully and gazing around at everyone, she started to talk.`
` She looked almost like the main character in a play`
` who had come out onto the stage, bathed in a spotlight...`
`"It's about this morning.`
` Please remember the time after the murders occurred, during the big uproar that followed.`
` ......We wanted to tell Kinzo-san about the crime, but he wouldn't come out no matter how many times we called him on the telephone.`
` Remember that time."`
`"Anyway, ...isn't it bad that we can't get in contact with him?`
` In the worst case, Father might not even know that there was a crime! Right?!"`
`"......W, well, I wonder........."`
`Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo's existence, Kanon mumbled his words...`
`"............Who was the last person to meet Father...?`
` ......And when?"`
`"I, ...it was me.`
` Last night, ......up until the time of the uproar from when Battler-kun found the gold, I was in Father's study, giving the daily report."`
`".........So around 23:00 last night.`
` ..................Heheh."`
`Erika chuckled significantly.`
`"A, and what's your point?`
` Ridiculous."`
`"I think Kyrie-san probably did that intentionally.`
` ......Am I right?"`
`"..............."`
`"Wh, `
`...what do you mean...`
`...by that......?"`
`"......I figured someone might fall for it."`
`"I see.`
` Thanks, Kyrie-san.`
` Actually, I was planning to say the same thing if you didn't."`
`"......I, ...is it really that important`
` who saw the Master last...?"`
`"Yes.`
` If we take the circumstances into account, then in response to the question 'Who met him last?',`
` it was very odd for Natsuhi-san to instantly answer 'me'."`
`"Wh, ......why?!`
` Madam told the truth without hiding anything...!"`
`"Be quiet!!`
` Why do you think that was odd...?"`
`"Why are you so sure that no one else met Kinzo-san after 23:00?"`
`"W, ......well, ...that's because I watched as he went to bed.`
` It's only natural to assume that he would then sleep until morning `
`and not meet with anyone..."`
`"In light of the circumstances, it was easy to suspect that the last person to spot him had some kind of involvement with this case.`
` ......If a normal person was in Natsuhi-san's position, they wouldn't say 'I was the last person to meet him.`
` I met him at 23:00'. `
`Right, Kyrie-san......?"`
`"............`
`......Yes, that's right.`
` ......A normal person would say `
`'I met him at 23:00.`
` However, I'm not sure that I was the last person to meet him'.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"<Good>.`
` .........Claiming to be the last witness is usually quite difficult.`
` ......That is, unless you know some reason which makes you sure that there were no other witnesses after you."`
`"......In third-rate mysteries, the last one to spot the victim is often the culprit.`
` They killed the victim themselves, so they knew that no one else could have met the culprit later on...is how the argument goes."`
`"Hohoh, ...hohohoho...`
` Couldn't that be nothing more than a minor misspeak...?`
` It's not important enough to be picked up out of the blue and focused on..."`
`"Yes, yes, that's nothing more than nitpicking...`
` Isn't it a little too early to suspect Natsuhi-san because of a little slip of the tongue like that......?"`
`"Furthermore, you mentioned needing a reason to be sure that no one else spotted the person in question...`
` but of course, she had such a reason...!`
` She left the room after seeing the Master go to bed!`
` Following common sense, it's perfectly natural to assume that he probably wouldn't meet anyone else until the next morning...!"`
`"......No.`
` That isn't natural at all.`
` After all, Natsuhi-san, Doctor Nanjo, and Kumasawa-san all made this claim a short while ago.`
` Please, try to remember."`
`"And Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to meet him, right...?`
` Around 11:00 last night.`
` I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."`
`"Th, ......that's......`
` B, but Father is a fickle person...`
` He used to sometimes say that he had a revelation in a dream all of a sudden, wake up in the middle of the night, and walk around the mansion.`
` Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"Nn, ......y, yes, such a thing has happened before...`
`...Anyway, ......umm, he is a fickle person. `
`R, right, Kumasawa-san...?"`
`"...Hoh, ...hohoho.`
` That's true...`
` He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed...`
` That happens a lot, yes......"`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......Grandfather often slips out of bed all of a sudden late at night...`
`...That's what you claimed."`
`"<Good>.`
` Your memory is pretty good, Battler-san.`
` .........In other words, it's well known amongst the people at the Ushiromiya head house, Natsuhi-san included,`
` that there's a chance Kinzo-san might wake up in the middle of any given night on a whim and wander around.`
` On top of that, they were aware that this happened quite often."`
`"......Isn't that odd?`
` ...If you knew that Father often wanders around at night,`
` there's no way you could be certain that he'd stay in his bed until morning.`
` Right?"`
`"It really is......like a third-rate mystery.`
` A lot of those have this part in the last 5 minutes where the culprit asks `
`'When did you figure out it was me?' and the detective answers..."`
`"Seriously......`
` That's why I feel let down. `
`If it turns out that Natsuhi-san really is the culprit, this'll be worse than a TV mystery.`
` ......That's why I want to clear away the suspicion surrounding Natsuhi-san as soon as I can.`
` I want to make sure that this mystery isn't third-rate before I do anything else."`
`".........uu, ......gah......"`
`"......There's no need to get anxious, Natsuhi.`
` This is a classic word game used by detective wannabes.`
` ......So what's her point here?`
` How could she corner you just with this accusation? `
`In the court of hell, all of the demon jurors will declare you innocent.`
` So calm down and don't get flustered..."`
`".........It may be true that Natsuhi oba-san looks suspicious when you say it like that.`
` ......Still, it sounds like you're just nitpicking to me."`
`"But it is suspicious.`
` ......Isn't this more than enough reason to suspect that Natsuhi nee-san is hiding something...?"`
`"Th, that accusation is entirely false...!`
` And that's not fair, Eva-san...!!`
` Aren't you the sole person who can confirm that I really was here at 23:00...?!"`
`".........Is this true, Eva-san?"`
`"............`
`.........Oh, did that happen?`
` ......Heheheh, I'm sorry.`
` At the time, I was losing my head because the gold had just been found,`
` so I forgot all about meeting Natsuhi nee-san until just a second ago."`
`"So, Eva-san, you can confirm that Natsuhi-san was a witness at 23:00?"`
`"Yes, unfortunately.`
` I'm able to acknowledge that one part of Natsuhi nee-san's story.`
` ......But only that she came out of this room."`
`".........Wh, what are you implying?"`
`"Let me tell you what I'm implying.`
` ......No, I've wanted to say this for a long time now.`
` ...I really did feel like saying this in the middle of such a tragic murder case would be improper,`
` but the timing now is just too perfect. `
`.........You know what I'm talking about, don't you?`
` ......Natsuhi nee-san.........?"`
`The servants gulped and held their breaths...`
` It seemed that they hadn't been able to hide it......after all.........`
` In the middle of this heavy silence, ......Eva fingered her trump card, and Natsuhi pretended to be calm.`
` Both space and time grew as heavy as lead...and swallowed up everything...`
`"Just when did Kinzo-san disappear, I wonder......?"`
`Erika's words, spoken almost casually,`
` tore that atmosphere to pieces like shattering glass......`
`"......Simply put, we haven't met him once at the family conferences this year or last."`
`"That's right...`
` We've suspected it since last year.`
` ...Seeing as how my son and the others have just been killed, this may not be the time or place to pursue this. `
`......But there's a chance that this has something to do with the crime, so we will do just that..."`
`"It's possible that you have a motive for hiding Father's death.`
` ......We can suspect that you're embezzling Father's assets."`
`"If Father were to die, an investigation would be conducted for the distribution of the assets and your embezzlement would be exposed.`
` That's why you hid the fact that Father is already dead!!"`
`".........I see.`
` That's more than enough for the 'why dunnit'.`
` This keeps getting more and more third-rate.`
` Aaah, ......boring."`
`"I, ......I don't know what you're talking about...!! `
`You say I'm hiding the head's death?!`
` I most certainly won't forgive...such a reckless accusation!!"`
`"That's right...!!`
` In addition to Madam, the other servants take care of the Master on a daily basis, and they see him all the time...!!`
` Genji-san, Shannon-san, and Kanon-kun...!`
` Even Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san meet with him often...!"`
`"......P, perhaps because he doesn't trust me, I haven't seen him even once since last year, but..."`
`"Be quiet, Gohda!!!"`
`"Eek!!`
` M, my apologies...!"`
`"Aren't all of the witnesses besides Natsuhi-san servants employed by her? `
`......So you used money to make them follow your story...ah man, this is really third-rate. Pitiful, pitiful.`
` .........I'm disappointed, Natsuhi-san.`
` So I guess I'll have to finish this now."`
`"F, .........finish what......?!"`
`"Ushiromiya...Kinzo-san."`
`".........What is it, ...uninvited guest?"`
`"You don't exist, do you?`
` ......You're a ghost whose death was concealed by those humans who didn't want it known because of the inheritance problem."`
`"......Hmph. `
`......Heheheheheheheh."`
`"Ghosts are supposed to quickly pass on to the next world.`
` ......Even though this is the first time we've met, I've yet to give you a proper greeting. My apologies."`
`"......Good day, pleased to meet you.`
` And goodbye!!!"`
`So close to Erika's face that you might just barely have been able to wedge a single sheet of paper between them,`
` ......Beato's pipe stopped suddenly.`
`"And a good day to you too.`
` ......I'm the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice the Golden.`
` I'll be your opponent in this fight from here on out."`
`"Glad to meet you, I'm the detective of this game, Furudo Erika.`
` I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.`
` And now, goodbye."`
`"So, you're Lady Bernkastel's next piece after Ange.`
` ......I'm afraid I didn't get to fight with her to my satisfaction in the end. `
`I'm glad I'll be able to lock horns with you this time,`
` Lady Bernkastel's piece...!"`
`"............My master is almighty and all-powerful.`
` A fool like you couldn't even begin to compare with her.`
` I accept your challenge."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` You really are calm.`
` ......Even though a witch has appeared before you and is about to fight with magic and fantasy.`
` .........If you were Battler, you'd be lying on the ground, screaming that this can't be a mystery anymore."`
`"Yeah, even in the mystery genre, parallel universes like this have gotten popular lately.`
` You know about Pure Reasoning Space and all that?"`
`"Ayatsuji Yukito doesn't make his debut until next year."`
`"You sure are picky for a witch."`
`"Hahha!!`
` You think you're on the same level as a witch?`
` Don't be so full of yourself, you mere human!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, something bounced around the room at terrifying speeds...!! `
`It was the witch's stake.`
` The witch's wedge which contained the power of the blue truth within it...! `
`Of course, a mere human like Erika couldn't follow that terrible speed with her eyes.`
` Erika understood this, so she didn't attempt to look every which-way stupidly trying to spot it.`
`"You blockhead!!`
` Take this!!"`
`With a terrible sound, Lucifer's blue stake buried itself into Erika's right collarbone.`
` It pierced all the way through her back.`
` Lucifer rotated and rebounded, landed in front of Beato,`
` and disappeared, laughing shrilly.`
` Erika wasn't blown back.`
` She had just been run through deeply by the blue wedge.`
`".........So, this is that so-called blue truth.`
` Well then, let me hear your opinion."`
`"{p:2:You can't deny the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 23:00. `
`During the following six hours or more before you pushed your way into the study, Kinzo had many chances to escape this study! `
`Because of this, you can't state decisively that Kinzo doesn't exist.}"`
`Beato announced that with an expression worthy of her title as witch.`
` Erika was silent.`
`......Was she too shocked to speak? `
`There was no anguish in her expression.`
` She was just quietly listening to Beato's blue truth.`
` No, ......judging by her disdainful expression,`
` it's probably more appropriate to say that Beato's words went in one ear and out the other.`
`".........<Good>.`
` Let's start with the classic moves.`
` .........By the way, this thing really is stuck good.`
` I can't take it out."`
`She tried pulling from the front and the back of the blue wedge that pierced her, but it didn't budge an inch.`
` However, her indifferent, relaxed expression didn't budge an inch either.`
`"You can't take it out!`
` ......The blue truth can only be defeated by the red truth.`
` ......For one such as yourself, a guest who came to this island at most a day ago, there is no truth that you could possibly know!`
` That means there exists no red that you can use...!`
` In other words, this is checkmate!!"`
`"......I see.`
` So that's what kind of space this is.`
` ......In that case, I'll need a piece worthy of fighting with a witch. `
`......I'm the detective.`
` My position is to be an opponent for the human culprit.`
` You are a witch.`
` ...There does exist a fitting piece to use against witches and demons."`
`"Let me introduce you.`
` .........Miss Dlanor.`
` It looks like it's your turn."`
`"D, .........Dlanor...!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` I thought so, I was certain you'd bring that piece in sooner or later...!!`
` The ten wedges with which to hunt witches, the archbishop of witch hunting, Dlanor!!"`
`"There's no more fitting piece in a battle against demons.`
` I have my double, Erika, and the greatest natural enemy of witches, Dlanor.`
` I've now taken control of the seventh rank with my two rooks.`
` ......Let me show you, Lambdadelta. And you too, Beatrice.`
` Now you'll see how useless your struggling is. `
`......*giggle*, ahahahahahaahahaahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`The air shone brightly, and the piece Erika had guided there showed its form...`
` That form resembled a clergy member perfectly suited for confronting an evil witch......`
`"Pleased to meet you. `
`Dlanor A. Knox is my NAME."`
`Even though this space was like a bomb just waiting to go off,`
` she introduced herself in a neat and frank manner.`
`......Her out-of-place appearance, completely different from those of the demons and witches, `
`felt blatantly odd and had a kind of severity to it.`
`"......This is the first time I've met you, but I've heard all the rumors.`
` Therefore, this truly doesn't feel like a first meeting."`
`"The same goes for me, <Miss> Beatrice. `
`The detailed materials about you in Eiserne Jungfrau are summarized in 600 PAGES.`
` I always read those, so this doesn't feel like a first meeting to me EITHER."`
`"The secretary of hell could summarize those 600 pages into 6 letters."`
`"Allow me to ASK."`
`"'Danger'."`
`"That's a good SUMMARY.`
` When I get back, out of respect to you, I will summarize the materials related to you with only 2 more letters than that, a total of eight LETTERS."`
`"<Ｅｘｅｃｕｔｅｄ>."`
`".........So I'm <ｃｕｔｅ> now, *cackle*!`
` You're too polite, my guest...!"`
`"Then let us CONTINUE.`
` <Miss> Beatrice.`
` I, Dlanor, the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, do humbly accept my role as your OPPONENT."`
`"My first move is over.`
` If you can't remove the blue wedge from that Furudo Erika over there, `
`then you might as well totter back up to heaven and get back to your usual boring job of stamping things!"`
`"......I ask that you take care of this wedge or whatever it is.`
` It looks like Beatrice-san thinks she's already achieved checkmate with just this."`
`After making a show of tapping the blue wedge that pierced her with her finger,`
` Erika shrugged as though taunting Beatrice.`
`"......B, Beatrice..."`
`"It's alright. I'm just toying with her a bit. `
`............After all, if things get bad, I can grab Kinzo and run out of here whenever I want.`
` I can leave this room at any time and go anywhere."`
`"That is USELESS."`
`"......Hoh?"`
`"Now that you've met up with me, this is your DEMISE.`
` Escape will not be PERMITTED. No one can ESCAPE."`
`"It's true that we can't deny the possibility that Father suddenly woke up and went somewhere. `
`.........But you know what? I can state that such a thing couldn't have happened.`
` Heheheh, you know why?"`
`"H, how could I know...?!`
` Are you trying to say that you stood outside this door all night, watching to make sure the head didn't take a step outside...?!"`
`"Yes, someone was watching. `
`This kid right here!!"`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Let it be known that entering or exiting through this door is impossible.`
` The palace guards are ordered to blockade the study door."`
`The doors to heaven opened with a strong, unrelenting radiance like the sun's,`
` announcing the arrival of Dlanor's underlings.`
` Those words were clad in the red truth and cut off the witch's method of escape.`
`"Siesta 410, right here!"`
`"Siesta 45, right here!`
` It has been some time, Great Lady Beatrice! `
`We were dispatched in accordance with Alliance Agreement #1516 and a request from the Great Court of Heaven.`
` We apologize for the rudeness that is to follow...!"`
`"We've formed a precision blockade on the study door nyeh.`
` I think it's best if you stay away from the door, nyeh?`
` Kihihi!"`
`"Allow me to speak. `
`I say again, {p:1:from last night at 23:00 until the present time, the study door was not opened even once}."`
`"Wh, ......what is that scrap of paper?"`
`"It's a completely ordinary receipt.`
` But even so, this mere scrap of paper proves that you lied."`
`"Last night, when you came out of the study,`
` Eva saw her chance and wedged a receipt into the crack of the door to the study...!`
` And that fell down just now when Rudolf-kun opened the door for us...!!"`
`"Know what that means? `
`In other words, from 23:00 last night until now, `
`it's impossible that Father opened this door!!"`
`".........Wh, what'd you say......?"`
`"Rudolf.`
` The window was locked, right?"`
`"......Yeah. That's why I smashed the glass."`
`"The other windows are all locked as well.`
` They're built so that you can't lock them from the outside...!"`
`"Allow me to speak! `
`Know that {p:1:the windows were all locked}!`
` Palace guards, blockade all of the windows."`
`"By the name of Eiserne Jungfrau, I give the palace guards permission to make use of forbidden weapons."`
`"Understood.`
` Entire force, Permission Granted for Use of Forbidden Weapon: Red Warhead.`
` Begin Transmitting Activation Code!"`
`"Unya?`
` The password doesn't work nyeh."`
`"410, turn caps lock off and try again...!"`
`"Siesta Squad, Precision Blockade for Study Door and All Windows Complete.`
` We warn the Great Lady Beatrice that if anything is caught passing through these physically, conceptually, or by any other method,`
` we will shoot without warning...!"`
`"Data Link from Archangel Satellite 4.`
` Homing Format, Verdict-Model Conceptual Guidance...!"`
`"And on top of that, we've got Red Warheads nyeh.`
` Impossible to shoot down, impossible to avoid, impossible to survive when hit.`
` ......It'd smash even Lady Beatrice into little bits nyeh♪"`
`The Siesta Squad had laid down a pinpoint blockade over the door and all of the windows.`
` Escape would no longer be permitted through any of these...!`
`".........My, my.`
` ......I should be doing the welcoming, but it seems I am the one being welcomed.`
` I'm grateful for the courtesy call, and you've even brought the Siesta Sisters...!"`
`"Allow me to inform you that your paths of retreat have been cut off!`
` Commander Dlanor, let us now remove the sin and purify...!!"`
`"You've done WELL.`
` .........<Miss> Beatrice.`
` I've had your paths of retreat TERMINATED.`
` You cannot leave through the door, nor can you leave through the WINDOWS. `
`Therefore, escape will now be PROHIBITED."`
`".........You think you've shut me in with this alone?`
` *cackle*cackle*......"`
`The Inquisitor of Heresy in Heaven and her subordinates surrounded the witch.`
` The subordinates used a powerful barrier to cut off Beato's methods of escape.`
`......Demons fight, and as a result, they sometimes escape.`
` However, angels block off passages of escape, and as a result, they eradicate their targets without fail...!`
`"In other words, this study was a perfect closed room from the time Natsuhi nee-san claims she said goodnight`
` until the time Rudolf opened the door...!"`
`"In that case, Father would have to be here.`
` But there's not even a trace of him...!!`
` Come on, what the hell is going on...?!!"`
`"Uh, ...gah............"`
`"I keep telling you to calm down...!`
` The thought that I, Beatrice, could be shut in just because the doors and windows are closed is simply laughable."`
`"...Kinzo...I was just playing around, but it seems our guest has no such intentions.`
` Let's withdraw before we lose our chance."`
`"Yes.`
` I would not regret losing this life of mine, but for Natsuhi's sake, I cannot die yet."`
`Beato waved her pipe and the air was split vertically.`
` Then, a pitch black gate appeared there and slowly opened.`
`......It was a warp portal, the same as the pitch-black holes that Gaap used.`
`"I believe this was written on my files.`
` An elusive phantom.`
` Can appear from anywhere and disappear to anywhere...!`
` As long as Kinzo has me, it will be impossible to capture him...!"`
`The pitch black gate opened.`
` That gate led from everywhere and to nowhere.`
` Both Beato and Kinzo would be sent to a place where no one could catch them,`
` a place where no one could set foot in, much less chase after them...!`
`"Th, ...this is the study of the Ushiromiya family head.`
` And it is also a room that Father helped to design personally.`
` ......Do you think there would be anything strange about him having some way of getting outside without using the door...?"`
`"...Y, yes, that's correct...!`
` There would be nothing strange about the Master having a hidden door...!"`
`"A hidden door?! `
`Heh, and where would that be...?!"`
`"It's a hidden door, so I don't know.`
` ......There are several devices and hidden doors in this mansion that only Father knows of.`
` ......No one has seen them directly, but everyone in this mansion knows about them vaguely. Correct...?"`
`"Uh, ...ah, ......yes...!"`
`"......It's true that there have been always been rumors about hidden passages only the Master knows of..."`
`"I, it's true that Kinzo-san would probably like devices such as that..."`
`"Hohohoho......`
` And they are hidden doors, after all...`
` No matter how much people such as ourselves might search, it's only natural that we won't find them."`
`".........I see. It's a Devil's Proof.`
` You're saying we can't deny the possibility that a hidden door exists in this room."`
`"That's nonsense, a farce...!!`
` Even considering that your lie about concealing Father's death is about to be revealed, how dare you...!!"`
`"That's right!! Just where in this study is there a hidden door...?!!`
` Try and prove that it exists!!"`
`"{p:2:Proof is unnecessary!! `
`It's a Devil's Proof. It's impossible to find a hidden door and therefore impossible to disprove that it exists!! `
`Therefore, no one can deny the possibility that Kinzo escaped from this study through a hidden door!!}"`
`"{p:1:I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this ROOM.}"`
`Beato's blue wedge, which had been fired off as a farewell gift,`
` was crushed with a flash of Dlanor's longsword, ......and the pitch black gate was crushed as well...! `
`And it wasn't just crushed visibly and physically.`
` From that moment onwards, the warp portal which conceptualized hidden doors had been destroyed.`
`"Wh, why can someone like you, who is neither the owner of the study nor the Game Master,`
` ......use the red truth......?!`
` And what was that?! What to you mean you 'will not allow' hidden doors to exist?!"`
`"It's because this is the mystery genre. `
`{p:1:Knox's 3rd. It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.`
` }Hidden doors mustn't exist in the mystery genre. Sorry about that."`
`"In this world, there are no other gods except our god, and no hidden doors EXIST.`
` They must not EXIST, we won't let them EXIST.`
` It is blasphemy against our GOD."`
`"......Enough pride in you to shock a witch...`
` Hah, it's a pleasure greater than shock...!"`
`"Ahahahahahahaahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Here it is, the ten wedges to pierce witches...!!`
` Just like usual, it's the kind of irrational argument that I just love to hear...!"`
`"What a fool.`
` The Devil's Proof might have been vague enough to let you escape from everything until now, `
`but now that you're up against Dlanor, that move won't work anymore, Beatrice!"`
`"......As I thought, you're no different from any witch after ALL.`
` I'm DISAPPOINTED."`
`"......Beato.`
` ...It seems this isn't an opponent we'll be able to escape from easily after all."`
`"Please do entertain me, Beatrice-san.`
` ......You should at least serve some tea for your guests.`
` It doesn't even matter if it's third-rate!"`
`"Come on, please use the blue truth,`
` and tell me how Kinzo-san escaped from the closed room study...!!"`
`"......Very well. `
`Make sure you don't cry!!"`
`"{p:2:It's possible that, after slipping out the door, Kinzo noticed the trick with the receipt and correctly returned it to its original place.}"`
`"{p:1:Denial of that with the red has already been FINISHED. `
`After 23:00, the door to the study was not opened even ONCE.}"`
`"{p:2:Kinzo might have been a marvelous magician and an inventor, right?! `
`He might have invented a drug that turns his body to mist and slipped out through the keyhole!!}"`
`"{p:1:No such drug EXISTS. `
`It must not EXIST.}"`
`"{p:2:Or maybe he invented a teleport device, right?! `
`That possibility is impossible to deny because of the Devil's Proof!!}"`
`"{p:1:Such a machine does not EXIST. `
`I will not allow it to EXIST.}"`
`"{p:2:Oh, so you can examine every drug in the world? `
`You can deny the existence of unknown scientific devices?! `
`There's no way you can, it's a Devil's Proof! `
`You cannot deny that they might exist!}"`
`"{p:1:I will REPEAT. `
`By the name of god, I will not let such a drug or machine EXIST. `
`I will not allow them to exist for all ETERNITY.}"`
`"The future, too?!`
` Oho, so you think you can even deny something into the future of the human race?!"`
`"It's Knox's 4th.`
` It is forbidden for unknown drugs or hard to understand scientific devices to be used."`
`"The progression of humanity, as well as techniques and knowledge that might be obtainable in the future, are decided upon by our GOD.`
` And the denial of their existence has been proclaimed for ETERNITY.`
` Therefore, I will not allow for such a technique to exist for all ETERNITY. It is not PERMITTED."`
`Beato and Dlanor had supposedly just gone through a massive exchange of red and blue.`
`......However, not only did Dlanor not take any damage, she also showed no signs of fatigue.`
` Beato might have been a fearsome witch, but blood flowed through her veins and she did breathe.`
` She felt both pain and fatigue.`
` But Dlanor......was like a doll made of marble.`
` She felt no fatigue, no pain, no hesitation.`
` Even if Beato's sharp wedges had aimed right for Dlanor's eyes, she wouldn't have shut them.`
`......No, it's doubtful that she ever even blinks in the first place......`
`"B, ......Beatrice......, hang in there......"`
`"......I've heard the rumors, but we really do share the worst compatibility.`
` ......To think that dreams, hopes and even future possibilities are forbidden. The pride of the gods is overwhelming. `
`......I'd expect no less from a witch hunt executioner.`
` It seems we'll never be able to drink together."`
`Even the strikes which had made Battler surrender over and over had absolutely no effect on Dlanor.`
`......Well, I knew that already more or less, but to think that I would be repelled so easily...`
`"Quite a formidable opponent..."`
`"Oh my, so even the great Goldsmith has gotten old and decrepit.`
` Hearing those words come out of your mouth is rarer than seeing two comets in the night sky...!"`
`"Hmph. I'm not decrepit, I'm already dead."`
`"Hah, that's true.`
` Sorry, but I won't let you be for just a little longer."`
`Beato experienced something she'd only rarely felt during her entire life.`
`......It was probably what we'd call 'hardship'.`
` Beato quietly brushed aside Natsuhi's hand that tried to comfort her,`
` and she regained her posture again, showing off her witch's pride and her continued readiness to fight.`
`"Is that ALL?`
` There was no need for me to come HERE.`
` I'm DISAPPOINTED."`
`"I'm not done yet. I was just testing a few moves just now.`
` I was only trying to measure your abilities."`
`"How foolish.`
` Know your place, Golden Witch."`
`".........Lady Beatrice..."`
`Beato's expression became tense once again.`
` No longer was there any trace of mischief.`
`......The mood changed.`
`"The time for playing is over.`
` Here I go.`
` In that case, I shall acknowledge that Kinzo did not enter or leave the study.`
` Why don't I accept your closed room?"`
`".........HMM."`
`"Let it be known that Beatrice has changed her pattern of attack."`
`Beatrice, who had until then thoroughly resisted the idea that a closed room existed, did an about face.`
` She proclaimed that she accepted that proposition.`
` Of course, this didn't mean that she'd surrendered.`
` This was a new attack of Beato's.`
` Dlanor noticed this and readied herself.`
`"What's going on?`
` Why did Lady Beatrice acknowledge the closed room when she's trying to destroy it nyeh?"`
`"......Sh, she's probably trying to claim that Kinzo existed outside of this room. `
`......Confirmation that the Great Lady Beatrice's warp portal has reactivated!"`
`"{p:2:Natsuhi claims to have 'talked with Kinzo in the study', but she never said that she spoke with him face to face. `
`Therefore, if Kinzo was in a location other than the study, there is no contradiction as long as they held a conversation!}"`
`".........nn-"`
`After bouncing at an erratic angle, the witch's stake pierced the top of Dlanor's foot.`
`"You sure are slow. `
`......Heheheheh, top of the foot, all mi~ne!"`
`"{p:2:Natsuhi used the internal phone line in this study to speak with Kinzo, who was in another place! `
`There's nothing strange about Kinzo, who hates the relatives, predicting that they would enter his study and leaving to go elsewhere. `
`He might have gone to the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian!}"`
`Asmodeus's stake, which contained the power of Beato's blue truth and pierced Dlanor's foot, changed into a blue wedge.`
`"Not bad, that makes sense nyeh...!"`
`"......Blue truth, effective."`
`A cyclone of gold butterflies swept up with Beato at its center.`
`......The magical power of the pitch black gate that had been smashed was once again refilled.`
`......If I can hold Dlanor off here somehow,`
` this time, I'll be able to warp Kinzo out of the study, all the way to Kuwadorian...! `
`Dlanor moved clumsily, trying to pull the blue wedge out of her foot,`
` but it didn't even budge.`
` Of course, Beato didn't miss this chance.`
` No witch would!`
`"I've got more, so get ready. `
`{p:2:There's a chance the Kinzo Natsuhi mentioned does not refer to the person himself! `
`The Kinzo Natsuhi spoke of might have been another name for this room, right? `
`Kinzo had taken refuge in Kuwadorian and was impossible to contact. `
`Perhaps Natsuhi called this room 'Father', `
`and by contemplating inside of it, she felt as though she had received some sort of revelation from Kinzo!!}"`
`"We've stopped you from moving. You've already lost!"`
`Beelzebub's blue wedge pierced the base of Dlanor's neck! `
`Of course, even this didn't cause her to flinch, but her movements were restricted even further.`
`"......Interesting.`
` Is that ALL?"`
`"You don't call it a full course dinner if you stop at the soups and hors d'oeuvres! `
`I'll hit you with the main dish and the dessert at once, so watch your stomach explode and die!!!"`
`"{p:2:Even if, as you say, this is a closed room and impossible to escape from, you can't deny the possibility that he is still hiding in this room. `
`I'm not talking about a hidden door! He might be under the bed or above the ceiling! `
`He might be hiding in a truly unobtrusive blind spot that only demons could know of, right?!}"`
`"{p:2:Or, it might be that Natsuhi, who was ordered to speak specially on Kinzo's behalf, `
`considered herself both his representative and another Kinzo! `
`In other words, it's possible that Natsuhi was also Kinzo!}"`
`"{p:2:I've got plenty more!! At 23:00 last night, Kinzo escaped out the window! `
`Natsuhi watched him go, then locked the window!! `
`This doesn't lead to any problems. In fact, it might be the most beautiful blue truth yet!} `
`How's that?! Dlanor A. Knox?! `
`Hyahhahahahaaaaahhhh!! There are many ways to escape from this closed room!!"`
`"Know your foolishness in trying to oppose my master!"`
`"There's no need for you to argue back."`
`"Just lose and sleep for all eternity...!"`
`The Seven Sisters appeared from Beato's golden tornado one after another, and they pierced Dlanor with blue wedges.`
` Four blue wedges were buried into her neck, her chest, her gut, and her thigh.`
` Including the one buried into the top of her foot, she was pincushioned by five stakes.`
`"Aaaah, Beatrice-sama!`
` What about my turn?!"`
`"I'll use you if I think of any more. Be quiet for now!! `
`*cackle*cackle*, how's that, Dlanor the witch hunter?!!`
` After skewering and burning so many witches in the past, how does it feel to be skewered by a witch this time?!! `
`Hehhihhahhaaahhhahahahahahaha!!"`
`They were all ridiculous arguments, but they came fiercely one after another.`
` Though a total of five wedges pierced Dlanor, her expression didn't change in the slightest.`
` However, her movements had indeed been limited...`
`"Hyuu...`
` Witches sure are scary nyeh...`
` You can't beat twisted logic nyeh."`
`"They don't violate the Knox Decalogue...`
` Effective...!"`
`".................."`
`"...W, ......well done, Beatrice...!`
` Even if there was no one in this study and even if it was a closed room, that alone isn't enough to deny Father's existence...!"`
`"Against a normal opponent, I'd think the matter settled by now.`
` ......But this is Dlanor. Head Inquisitor of Heresy! `
`This ruthless woman killed even her father when he violated the Decalogue...!`
` Kinzo, now!"`
`"Right...!"`
`Now that Dlanor had been pinned down, this was their last chance to recover their magical power and escape.`
` Once again, a pitch black gate began to rise slowly in front of Beato and Kinzo......`
` Though the gate had once been opened by simply drawing in the air,`
` it wasn't so easy in the study now, filled as it was with the power of denial.`
`"Wh, ......what do you think, everyone?!`
` No matter how much you question the state of this study, you can't question whether or not Father is in good health...!!"`
`"......Oh, so you say.`
` Both you and I...`
` had better not forget that we are part of this battle, right?`
` I cannot fight against witches, but I can fight against you."`
`Erika grinned at Natsuhi with a smile more demonic than a real demon's.`
`"......Natsuhi-san.`
` Let me ask again.`
` ......Last night, you're sure you spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo-san, right?"`
`"Y, yes.`
` I have said repeatedly that I came to deliver a report for the day and to say good night...!"`
`"This may be a strange thing to ask, but since it's needed to prove your innocence, `
`please answer me straightforwardly. `
`......Is this Kinzo-san you speak of the Ushiromiya Kinzo-san we all know of?`
` It isn't a different person or thing with the same name, is it?"`
`"I, I'm not really sure what you mean...!"`
`"......It's like this.`
` You didn't, for instance, start calling this room itself 'Father' after Father's death, right?`
` That's what she's asking.`
` You said you gave a daily report to Father before he went to sleep, right?`
` That doesn't mean you gave a daily report to the wall here inside the study called 'Father' all by yourself, right...?"`
`"H, how rude!!`
` Nothing of the sort happened...!`
` Father is Father!!`
` He is in good health!`
` And I most certainly gave him a report and said good night to him last night...!!`
` I'm not trying to trick you or talk my way out of anything!"`
`"I see.`
` In that case, can you repeat what I tell you to?`
` If you aren't tricking or deceiving us in any way, you should be able to repeat my words."`
`"F, fine.`
` I'll repeat whatever you want...!"`
`"Repeat it. `
`'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night,`
` speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo in the same room as him, which was this room'."`
`"I, I, 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night,`
` speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo in the same room as him, which was this room'!!"`
`"<Good>!`
` Then I'll ask one last thing.`
` ......Seriously now, Natsuhi-san,`
` you didn't do anything such as throwing Kinzo-san out the window after your conversation and locking the window behind him, right?`
` Because everything still makes sense if you did."`
`"Wh, why would I want to chase Father out the window?!!`
` This is intolerable! This mockery is intolerable!!"`
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`Let it be said that {p:1:the 'Kinzo' Natsuhi mentions refers to nothing other than Ushiromiya Kinzo}."`
`"Please, allow me to speak! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi claims to have met face to face with Kinzo in the study at 23:00}!"`
`"Ah, .........aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`Natsuhi let out a cry, but it was too late...`
` She had been totally suckered in by their provocation...! `
`The blue wedge to the foot representing a telephone discussion.`
` The blue wedge to the neck representing the study itself being called Kinzo.`
` The blue wedge to the gut representing Natsuhi herself being called Kinzo.`
` The blue wedge to the thigh representing Natsuhi letting Kinzo escape out the window and locking it afterwards.`
` The four of them were smashed up with a thin sound...! `
`Because Natsuhi, 'the one who knew the truth', had denied them,`
` those denials had gained the power of the red truth...! `
`Despite Kinzo's absence in this closed room, Beato had introduced five ways that Kinzo could still exist.`
` Natsuhi had carelessly crushed the premises behind four of those herself...!! `
`Only one wedge remained.`
` In other words, this was the last blue truth which could bury the contradiction of Kinzo existing in the study at 23:00 but not existing there later, after it had become a closed room.`
` There was only the theory that pierced Dlanor's chest, 'Kinzo is hiding somewhere in this room'.`
` With this theory, even if Kinzo didn't exist in this closed room of a study, he could 'exist' there...! `
`If this wedge of Satan's were to be crushed, their chances of escaping this room would become hopelessly dim......!`
`"Gghhh, .........ack...!!`
` B, Beatrice-sama...!`
` Quickly...escape while you still can...!!`
` Ggh, gyah......"`
`Dlanor slowly grasped the final wedge, which still pierced her chest.`
`......Apparently, that vice-like grip was hurting Satan as though all the bones in her body were being broken.`
`"All that remains......is this one WEDGE.`
` It was about Kinzo hiding somewhere in this room, CORRECT?"`
`"As the detective, I've searched all of those places.`
` If I didn't find him, just where could he be hiding? *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`With the final wedge still sticking out of her chest, Dlanor slowly approached Beato...`
` If this wedge was taken out, ......then......!`
`"Allow me to ASK.`
` Just where in this study is Kinzo HIDING?"`
`"Heheh, well then... `
`{p:2:Maybe he's under the bed?!}"`
`"{p:1:A check of that place has been FINISHED.}"`
`"{p:2:Maybe he's in the bathtub!!}"`
`"{p:1:A check of that place has been FINISHED.}"`
`"{p:2:Inside the closet! `
`Under the desk! `
`Behind the curtains!!}"`
`"{p:1:A check of that place has been FINISHED. `
`Check FINISHED. `
`Check FINISHED.}"`
`"{p:2:Behind the bookshelf, `
`behind the closet, `
`under the carpet, `
`under the floor, `
`above the ceiling, `
`behind the wallpaper, `
`inside the sofa, inside the chair, `
`inside the bed, inside the blankets, inside the walls, `
`inside a rock, `
`inside a stone, `
`inside the room!!}"`
`"{p:1:CheckFINISHED checkFINISHED checkFINISHED`
` checkcheckcheck FINISHEDFINISHEDFINISHED`
` checkcheckcheckcheckcheckcheckcheckcheck FINISHEDFINISHEDFINISHEDFINISHED FINISHEDFINISHEDFINISHEDFINISHED`
` <Die The death>!`
` <Sentence to death>!`
` <Great equalizer is The Death>!!}"`
`No locations would work against Dlanor by this point.`
` Dlanor took Beato's final desperate onslaught head on,`
` turning everything back with a far stronger power of denial! `
`Beat them up! `
`Knock them down with overwhelming force!! `
`No longer does any place exist in this study for Kinzo to escape to...!! `
`Beato was blown back like a leaf dancing in the wind, `
`knocked around over and over again like an empty can lying on a road.`
` By now, no matter how many times Beato used the blue truth, it wouldn't be able to defeat Dlanor's red truth...`
`"Hahahahaha, ahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` .........Witches are so pathetic.`
` ......You just try to talk your way out of things endlessly, trying to confuse the truth.`
` Let me borrow Dlanor's words.`
` ......I'm disappointed, Beatrice-san. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......guh........., ............ggghh......"`
`Erika coldly delivered these decisive words to Beato, ......who was crawling on the ground.`
`"Detective's authority.`
` The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes.`
` I have exercised this right.`
` Therefore, I can say this."`
`"Kinzo-san is not inside this room.`
` Furthermore, this room is a perfect closed room.`
` From the above two points, I can state this fact:`
` this room was empty the whole time.`
` Natsuhi-san lied about having met Kinzo-san here last night!`
` That makes this checkmate. Beatrice-san...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*, ......ahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha!`
` How's that?`
` Simply by the existence of this room!`
` This level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika.`
` What do you think, everyone?! `
`Ahhahahahahhahhahhaaaahh!!"`
`At these words, the final wedge shattered,`
` and at the same time, the pitch black gate which was about to open shattered once again.`
` This time, the warp portal had been completely destroyed...`
` No longer would Kinzo be permitted to exist in this room......or escape from it...`
` Beato struggled to her feet......but that was the best she could do.`
` She no longer had the energy to fight.`
` She had taken all of the denying red head on from close range.`
` It was all she could do to withstand a pain so strong it felt like she'd vomit up all her insides...`
` Even Beato, who had aimed for the title of strongest and most evil witch all this time, `
`......couldn't do a thing against a witch hunter.`
` No matter how sturdy a sandcastle you build on the beach, it can never win against the rising tide......`
`".........S, sorry, Kinzo...`
`......Looks like...this opponent really was tough after all......"`
`"Beatrice, I thank you.`
` ......You've done so much for me despite your remaining grudge."`
`"I guess it's true that your life flashes by when you see death coming.`
` ......I've remembered how you once looked when you were young.`
` .........You were annoyingly like Battler."`
`"I now pass on everything, my soul and the qualifications of the head, to Battler.`
` I no longer have any regrets...!"`
`"............Battler............`
`...My apologies...`
`...How pitiful...`
`...Though I swore to fight with you once again, `
`...I must settle my accounts with something like this..."`
`"..............."`
`To Beato, it seemed as though Battler had met her gaze.`
`......There was no way he could have.`
` This Battler was the piece Battler.`
` There was no way he could see Beato in this higher-level world.`
` However, his eyes really did meet hers.`
` Even though they couldn't have, .........Beato was sure they did.`
` As Erika, Eva and the others closed in on Natsuhi, questioning her over and over,`
` ......only Battler stood apart from that tumult.`
` His expression held none of the enthusiasm and excitement that the other humans had.`
` It just piercingly and coldly surveyed the scene.`
` And the expression on his face......was a quiet displeasure. Anger.`
` He wasn't feeling compassion for Natsuhi because her lie was about to be exposed.`
` However, he couldn't excuse Erika, who called herself an intellectual rapist`
` and was simply enjoying cornering Natsuhi and those who sympathized with her.`
` Then, he whispered softly.`
`{a:c: `
`".........It's useless."}`
`Beato and the others definitely heard that...`
`"You don't think......Battler might...turn things around from this weakened position......?"`
`"......I probably could have done it, back in the day. `
`......And Battler can probably do it."`
`".........Battler..."`
`"Battler...`
`......If you are indeed the man who will inherit everything from me, ......now is the time to prove it...!`
` Don't let the Legend of the Golden Witch end here......!"`
`"It's true that I met Father here last night!!`
` It's true!!`
` And he spoke to me of the Ushiromiya family's glorious history, as well as the burden of bearing it..."`
`"Your lie has already been exposed, Natsuhi-san.`
` We already know that you were alone in this room last night."`
`"Isn't it about time to give up and confess?`
` Culprits who are bad at giving up tend to go with bad mystery novels.`
` At least in the end, please prove that this is a slightly better third-rate mystery than that."`
`".........Aah, it's useless.`
` It's all useless."`
`Battler, who had been silent off by himself up until then, spoke.`
` At first, it sounded as though he was attacking Natsuhi.`
`......However, when Erika realized he was glaring directly at her, her expression visibly clouded with displeasure.`
`"And just what......is useless?"`
`"If this is a third-rate mystery, then the detective is also third-rate.`
` ......Listen up.`
` I'm gonna become Grandfather."`
`"......B, Battler......?!"`
`"You'll become......Kinzo-san?`
` Are you saying you'll become Kinzo-san and reenact his disappearance from this room?"`
`"......You couldn't possibly think you can deny my checkmate, right?`
` ......Fool!!!"`
`"......What is this man SAYING?"`
`"Hey, new girls.`
` ......This is your first game, correct? `
`Sorry, but calling checkmate after something like that is totally useless.`
` Yeah, it's all useless...!!"`
`"Wh, what are you talking about, Battler?`
` You say you'll become Dad......?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll reenact it.`
` I'll become Grandfather and disappear from this room."`
`"Y, you can't use the windows or the door, right?! How would you do it...?!"`
`"Did you find a hidden door?!"`
`"I don't have a clue either...yes, not a clue...!!"`
`*rustle*.`
`.........That sound wasn't just the noise of the onlookers fidgeting.`
`...It was a provocative chill that ran up Erika's spine.`
`".........Interesting.`
` I see, you are the Ushiromiya family head, the one who bears the Head's Ring.`
` That should more than qualify you to stand in for Kinzo-san. `
`.........Why don't you let us have a look at your theory?!!"`
`Erika's expression was no longer a provocative smile.`
`......It was malicious.`
` Extremely displeased.`
` She couldn't conceal her anger at having this very pleasurable time of hers ruined.`
`"......H, ......how will he...get us out of here......?"`
`"Heh, ......heheheheh...`
`......I've got it.`
` I see, so that move is still available."`
`"So you finally figured it out, you damn geezer.`
` Hidden doors and hiding under the bed......all that stuff is so pitiful it brings tears to the eyes. `
`This is THE Ushiromiya Kinzo we're talking about here.`
` ......There's got to be a more thrilling and exciting answer."`
`"Exactly.`
` How pitiful that even I couldn't think of it, even though it was about me.`
` And how pitiful that the only one of my relatives to understand me is Battler, the kid who's returned after being gone six years. `
`.........Battler, take my place.`
` Do not shame me!"`
`"Sure, Gramps!!`
` I'll teach these guests what the dignity of the Ushiromiya family head is all about!!"`
`"What are you planning to do..., Father...?!"`
`"Wahhahahahaha!!`
` Natsuhi, Beatrice, watch!`
` ......We'll show you what being the Ushiromiya family head is all about!"`
`"...That Battler, what is he trying to prove......?"`
`"There's no way he can do anything.`
` ......This is a perfect closed room!"`
`"Natsuhi oba-san. Come over here.`
` Now, move as I tell you to."`
`Battler called Natsuhi over to the window and whispered something to her with his back towards the others...`
`"......<Miss> Dlanor.`
` You're ready for everything, right?`
` It's not possible for Kinzo and the witch to slip out of this room, right?"`
`"Of COURSE.`
` ......Gertrude, Cornelia.`
` And the palace guards.`
` Double check that the seal of this closed room is PERFECT."`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` Our barrier is perfect."`
`"Allow me to speak. There are no hidden doors, and escape will not be granted through either door or window!`
` Palace guards, when Battler hits the barrier, fire your arrows without hesitation!"`
`"S, Siesta Corps, roger. `
`Battler-sama, prepare yourself...!"`
`"Escaping from this room...is impossible...!"`
`".........But he'll do it nyeh."`
`"H, how...?!"`
`"He's certain he can succeed even without any basis.`
` That's what it means to be the Ushiromiya head nyeh...!"`
`".........True. `
`Let's watch."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Let's see the majesty of Riiche's opponent...!"`
`"Then I'll begin."`
`Everyone nodded and watched Battler's every move...`
`"Grandfather was lying in bed like this`
` grunting his understanding of Natsuhi oba-san's daily report or whatever."`
`Battler laid down on the bed himself.`
` As if it still mattered now, Erika grumbled about disturbing the crime scene, but no one listened to her.`
`"Then, I stop answering and sleep.`
` .........Well, realistically speaking, I probably get tired of all that talking and only pretend to be asleep."`
`"Ahahahaha! You really do get it...!"`
`"I, ......I see that Father has gone to sleep,`
` ...bow silently, and leave."`
`Natsuhi lowered her head to Battler, who was still lying down in the bed, and turned around...`
` Then, she started wandering around, as though doing an inspection of the room.`
`"......After seeing that Grandfather was asleep, Natsuhi oba-san probably did an inspection of the room before leaving."`
`"Of course, she had Shannon-chan and the others clean it every day,`
` but she still checked it thoroughly herself.`
` ......Making sure there was no dust piling up.`
` Making sure that he hadn't run out of any consumables."`
`"Y, yes.`
` This is the room of the precious family head, so I check everything carefully myself instead of relying entirely on the servants.`
` I always do that."`
`".........Th, that's true.`
` Madam usually checks things very carefully."`
`"Her inspection is very detailed, and she even checks all of the consumables in the washroom one by one."`
`"In other words, it's not just dust on the windowsill like you see all the time on TV.`
` .........She checks to see that there's enough soap and toilet paper in the washroom.`
` Though she probably doesn't have to do it each day, she's very devoted."`
`"Th, that is my routine.`
` I mustn't slack off in my inspection of the head's room for even a single day."`
`".........So what's your point?`
` Please keep any showing off to a minimum."`
`"*giggle*.`
` So only the detective is allowed to show off?"`
`"Nn, gah, ......I, ...I'm...the...detective........."`
`"Since we're inside the study, you can probably tell, but even though we call it a study,`
` it wouldn't be wrong to call it a second house inside the mansion."`
`"It has a sleeping room, a study, a washroom, and even a toilet and bath.`
` In other words, it isn't a single room.`
` You could call it a full house."`
`"......Thank you for the explanation of the room's LAYOUT. `
`However, the move of having him hide somewhere in this room has already been DEFEATED."`
`"He isn't hiding.`
` However, there has to be several blind spots.`
` ......For example, if Natsuhi oba-san went into the bathroom to check the amount of toilet paper, `
`most of the study would be out of her sight range."`
`"......In other words, for almost every location in the study, the observer would have disappeared."`
`"!!`
` ......O, observer disappearance...!`
` We've lost track of Kinzo...!"`
`"Let it be said that the witch's darkness is filling the study."`
`"Good. ......It's being filled with the power of darkness.`
` Heheheheheheheh!"`
`"And so what if the observer...if Natsuhi left...?`
` ......What next?!"`
`"When Grandfather noticed that fussy Natsuhi oba-san leaving, he got up."`
`"Why?!"`
`"Wahhahhahhahhahha!!`
` On a mad night like this, nothing goes better with a drink than enjoying the mad weather of the night sky!!"`
`"......Because Natsuhi oba-san was in the blind spot of the bathroom,`
` it becomes possible for Grandfather to walk about the study at will."`
`It was possible for him to move without Natsuhi's knowledge.`
` It was possible for him to move without contradicting what Natsuhi knew!`
`"Warning, Battler is approaching the study door."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` A noise rings out when the lock on the study door is released. `
`Know that {p:1:you cannot leave through the door without Natsuhi thinking something was odd}."`
`Because Battler had acted as though he was heading for the door, Gertrude, who was sealing the door, immediately sent out a warning.`
` Maybe it was possible for him to leave the study while in Natsuhi's blind spot.`
`......However.`
`"That's right..., it's the sound!!`
` We know that there's a loud sound when the auto-lock is released!`
` Even if Natsuhi was in a blind spot inside the study, she wouldn't miss hearing the loud sound when the auto-lock is released.`
` Of course she would find that odd...!!"`
`"Allow me to speak. `
`Let it be said that {p:1:Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room}."`
`The washroom and toilet are very close to the door.`
` Even if they hadn't been, that auto-lock always lets off such a massive sound.`
` She'd be able to hear that sound no matter what.`
` Now that Natsuhi had spoken with Erika and the others about the details of the previous night,`
` she had made it quite clear that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.`
` The argument that Natsuhi would have failed to hear the lock would not work...!`
`"Please, allow me to speak once more. `
`{p:1:Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted.}"`
`"Let it be said that this is a useless struggle!`
` It is foolish...!!"`
`".........It's true that I can't break through the red of that Nee-chan by the door. `
`.........But what about you over there by the window?"`
`".........!"`
`Turning his back to Gertrude, who claimed that leaving through the door was impossible,`
` Battler locked his gaze on Cornelia, who stood in front of the window.`
`"Make sure you hold that barrier of yours up tight. `
`......'Cause you're gonna be.........blasted away, got it?"`
`By now, Battler's target was clear.`
`.........It was Cornelia.`
` And......it was the window.`
` He was going......to smash this closed room from the window.`
` Not expecting to be chosen as the target herself,`
` Cornelia was overawed for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure.`
` It was rare that a struggling, fleeing witch would directly challenge the barriers she set up.`
` Furthermore, such witches were always fighting desperately on the brink of death!`
`"Please, allow me to speak.`
` You are Battler's target, Cornelia.`
` I ask that you be on your guard."`
`"Fool!`
` God, have pity on this foolish lamb...!!"`
`"I'm no sheep.`
` ......The head of the Ushiromiya family is an eagle.`
` With one wing. `
`......Don't think you can keep me shut up in this study forever with just a flimsy window like that."`
`......Starting from a low posture, `
`......both silent and supple, `
`......Battler ran forward like a white leopard.`
`"............Th, `
`......this guy...`
`...couldn't possibly mean to.........!!"`
`"............ah!!`
` Th, this is...............agh. `
`A, allow me to speak...!`
` There is no way to defeat my red!`
` Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"`
`Cornelia thrust out both her arms and made a sign.`
` When she did, a red barrier closed in front of Battler.`
`"Know that this is useless, Ushiromiya Battler...! `
`Know that my {p:1:window is sealed from the inside and Natsuhi did not let Kinzo escape...!!}"`
`"{p:2:Natsuhi oba-san didn't let Grandfather escape. `
`......What if Grandfather snuck out, keeping it a secret from Natsuhi oba-san?!}"`
`"Wh, why would Kinzo go out the window on his own?!!!"`
`"To me, jumping out into the rainy sky on a mad night`
` is nothing more than a bit of fun to go with a drink!!!"`
`"But this is the third floor, right?! It's impossible!!!"`
`"Even you've jumped down a flight of stairs at least once in your life, right?`
` Three stories is nothing for Kinzo...!"`
`"I wouldn't put it past him."`
`"Wouldn't put it past him."`
`"Th, that's...r, ridiculous......!!!"`
`Blue cracks appeared in Cornelia's red barrier, and it shattered with a crisp sound.`
` It was all far too quick.`
` It looked almost as though she'd gotten out of the way herself in fear of Battler.`
`"E, ...Endless Nine...!!`
` Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine!!"`
`"Cornelia-sama, you can't block it, retreat...!"`
`At the same time the barrier shattered, the window behind Cornelia's back was flung open.`
` The curtains fluttered for just an instant.`
` Though it was all filled with rain, the heavens and the courtyard were spread out in front of them...`
` A fitting exit for an eagle leaping from this closed room!`
`"Cornelia, repair the BARRIER!!"`
`"As you wish, Commander Dlanor! `
`Kn, know that you will not be allowed to break this...!!"`
`Cornelia quickly came back to her senses and set up another red barrier.`
`......However, this was the last one.`
`"Please, allow me to speak...!!`
` Then let us accept for the time being that Kinzo escaped through the window...!`
` In that case, how did he lock a window which cannot be locked from the outside?! `
`{p:1:The window was locked from the inside!!}"`
`".........Useless!"`
`"Yeah, it's all useless!!"`
`Kinzo and Battler grinned! `
`She thought this feeble red could block the charge of Battler and Kinzo, the two family heads?`
`"{p:2:After Grandfather jumped out the window, Natsuhi oba-san probably noticed a slight draft. `
`She then approached the window, realized that it was wide open, and quickly closed and locked it...!!}"`
`"{p:2:Natsuhi probably couldn't even imagine that I had slipped out the window!}"`
`"{p:2:Yeah!! `
`So it's only natural that Natsuhi oba-san thought Kinzo was sleeping in bed!!}"`
`Now that Battler had found the answer, the red barrier was more fragile than thin glass.`
` The red magical wall of certainty had been smashed again, so easily that it disgraced the name of certainty itself! `
`Unbelievable, right? `
`That barrier was more firm than any Ronove had ever used against Jessica.`
` And yet it had been......destroyed so easily...! `
`Though Battler was rushing fiercely and had almost reached Cornelia, she didn't step aside.`
` Her steel spirit, worthy of the name Eiserne Jungfrau, didn't allow her to step aside.`
` She took a charm from her pocket, placed it against the thin air, and made a sign.`
` Then, not red, but blue burned there.`
` Though it was far more frail than the red barrier, it was her last method of resistance.`
`"Y, you won't get through, you won't!! Let me speak, let me speak!! `
`{p:2:Be that as it may, this is the third floor...! `
`How could a wingless human escape from the window......?!!`
` }Know that you won't get through, you wooooooooon't!!"`
`"Just quit your whining and watch!!!"`
`"{p:2:This is the answeeeeeeeer aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!}"`
`Battler......jumped.`
` He burst through Cornelia and her blue barrier, knocked them away, `
`.....and his body flew out the window through the darkness of the rainy sky.`
` The fragments of the blue barrier scattered, coloring the air beautifully.`
` The closed room...`
`...had been smashed open......!! `
`Battler......flew out of the mansion.`
` He was in the sky above the rainy courtyard.`
`......All of the raindrops became small round gems and were scattered through the air.`
` Battler flew through the treasure box world of the beautiful stormy sky, ......through the countless gems of rain that filled it.`
` In the sky over the world frozen in time, Dlanor and Battler faced each other.`
` If Battler, who had smashed and flown out the window, was like a knight leaping off a white horse,`
` ......then Dlanor, who floated in the air waiting for him, was also a knight.`
` In the air above the courtyard surrounded by the Ushiromiya mansion and frozen in time,`
` ......the true new head of the Ushiromiya family and the disciple of heaven who would test him crossed paths......`
`"......Well DONE.`
` When you fall into the courtyard, whether you live or die, it won't change the fact that Kinzo could have defeated this closed ROOM...!!`
` You who have thrown away your life and jumped are a MARTYR...!!`
` Well done, you have smashed our closed room BARRIER.`
` Splendid, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"However, I am the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, Dlanor A. Knox!!`
` I cannot allow you to escape out from under my NOSE...!`
` Now, at the end, allow me the honor of crossing swords with YOU!!"`
`"Sure, bring it on.`
` ......This game is surprisingly unrelenting."`
`In this world where the gems of rain......fell slowly like large snowflakes on a snowy field.`
`......Dlanor and Battler slowly.........crossed paths.`
` It seemed slow.`
` And yet, ......it happened in a flash.`
` Their gazes crossed and clashed like lightning.`
` Knight confronted knight head on, and it would all be decided in a single strike......! `
`Blue and red......crossed paths......`
`"{p:2:Was it shown beforehand that a blind spot existed within the study for Natsuhi?`
` If it wasn't shown, this theory will not be permitted.} `
`{p:1:Knox's 8th.`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED...!!}"`
`Dlanor's double strike with both the blue and red blades reached out to slice Battler.`
`........and missed.`
` Those longswords, which had never lost in a hundred battles, cut through the empty air......`
`"{p:1:When we entered the study, its structure was clearly referred to. `
`}......Too bad for you."`
`For the first time, Dlanor showed an expression.`
`......It was a sudden smile.`
` She had known since long ago that the study's structure had been referred to.`
` But she couldn't let him escape without making a single strike.`
` As an Inquisitor of Heresy, she could not do that.`
` So though she had known that she wouldn't make it, she had still crossed swords with Battler.`
`"Yes, I KNEW.`
` ......That answer of yours doesn't violate Knox's 8th."`
`"......Here it comes. Don't regret it."`
`"Yes, COME."`
`In Battler's hand......was a blade that shone red.`
` That blade etched out the red truth......`
`{p:1:'It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo's study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion'}`
`{p:1:'A study.`
` A book archive.`
` A place to sleep.`
` And a bathroom and washroom.`
` It was divided into multiple rooms'`
`That has already been shown.`
` And it suggests that there might have been a blind spot somewhere within the room...`
` Without any mercy, ...no, without any reluctance that would have been dishonorable,`
` ......the sword of red truth cut into Dlanor.`
` It cut a beautiful hemisphere through the countless gems of rain that filled the sky......`
`"Well.........DONE......"`
`"............"`
`Time...exploded into life.`
` Both of them...fell through the courtyard.`
` One drifted down.`
` The other tumbled through the air.`
` Then, there was a soft sound and a dull thud.`
`......The first was the sound of Battler landing gently in the courtyard.`
` The second was the sound of Dlanor crashing down.`
` After crouching down for a while,`
` .........Battler slowly stood up.`
` Though he had jumped down from the third floor, ......he had landed as lightly as though he had merely jumped over a fence......`
`"B, ...Battleeeeeeeeeeer.........!!"`
`Beato leaned out of the study window, looking to see if the supposedly wingless Battler had landed safely.`
`"Beato!!`
` Come on, jump!!"`
`"Huh......?!"`
`"That window is our way out!`
` ......So jump!!`
` You aren't the kind of witch who can be locked up inside a closed room, right?!!"`
`The study was no longer a closed room.`
` She could jump from here, escape from here...! `
`By now, the closed room which had threatened to capture the witch and suffocate her had been destroyed.`
`"Y, ......yes...!!`
` Y, you too, Kinzo...!"`
`"Go.`
` From the moment Battler showed his answer, my spirit had already escaped from this room."`
`Kinzo's form became a group of gold butterflies and disappeared.`
` The closed room barrier had dissolved, and the power which denies magic had scattered.`
` Beato ran towards the window.`
`......That was the only exit from the closed room of this witch hunt.`
` After glancing at the subordinates of the Inquisitor of Heresy and the Siesta Sisters,`
` she readied her wound-covered body and ran towards the window, just like Battler had done.`
` She looked like Cinderella running as she heard the bell toll.`
`"Th, there's no way we'll let you escape, Beatrice, Illusion of the Witch!!"`
`Erika flew at Beato, trying to latch on as Beato dashed,`
` but it was like trying to catch smoke, and she landed face first on the floor.`
`......There's no way a human can catch a witch.`
` For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible...!`
`"Siesta Corps, shoot the witch! Shoot her dead!!"`
`"Alignment conflict. Unable to fire."`
`"Allow me to speak.`
` I have no barrier prepared which can block Battler's blue truth."`
`Both Siesta 00 and Gertrude spoke with unbelievably calm voices.`
`"N, no one can stop them?`
` Not Battler? Not Kinzo?`
` Not Beatrice?!`
` If these guys escape, `
`......m, `
`......my closed room, my theory...!!`
` I'm...`
`...the detective, `
`...Furudo...Erika...`
` kkggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaggghhgh! `
`Gyaaaaaaaaaaggghhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`Erika crouched, screaming and clutching at her head.`
`"The great Golden Witch isn't gonna be defeated by something like that geezer's grubby study!! `
`It's still just the first twilight!`
` I'll teach these newcomers that your game isn't that easy!!"`
`Just like Battler, Beato also......jumped.`
` She drifted down through the rain treasure box world into Battler's chest.`
`......Battler caught her with both arms as though catching an angel's wings.`
` It was like a knight catching a princess who had been locked up in a tower,`
` ......like a beautiful picture of a scene in some fairy tale...`
`".........Crap, I think I'm in love.`
` ...Are all the Ushiromiya family heads guys like this?"`
`"If you were to write down the unprecedented feats of Ushiromiya Kinzo, `
`......you would probably have an uproarious tale longer than all the grimoires in the study put together.`
` It seems the tale of the next head will be worth writing down as well. `
`In fact, it already is being written.`
` It's already a very, very long tale.`
` ......Pu ku ku ku."`
`The demons giggled on top of the roof, holding umbrellas.`
` Then, they quietly looked down over the two in the courtyard.`
`"Hah, hahhahhahahahahahaha...`
`......You're......not bad at all......"`
`"I guess all your games've toughened me up."`
`In shock, Beato.....actually praised Battler as he held her in his arms.`
` Battler laughed in his usual carefree way......`
`".........Th, `
`......this is........., `
`impossible...impossible!!"`
`Erika looked down from the window and clenched her teeth, still clutching at her head.`
` Still holding Beato in his arms, Battler grinned back.`
`"Erika."`
`"......Wh, ...what is it...?"`
`"I'm not giving the riddle of the Golden Witch up to you.`
` I'll solve it.`
` ......That riddle belongs to the two of us. `
`Right, Beato?"`
`"Y, ......yes...!`
` My riddle is...yo......yo......"`
`"Yo?"`
`When Battler laughed evilly, Beato's face turned uncharacteristically red,`
` but even so, she spoke while laughing loudly.`
`"My riddle is...`
` yo......yours...`
`...yours alone...!! Ushiromiya Battler! `
`I won't let anyone else solve it...!!"`
`"Heheh, listen to her, saying something like that...!!"`
`Battler snorted, amused that Beato had said something so unlike her.`
` And, still holding Beato in his arms, he spun around in a kind of waltz.`
` The falling gems of rain celebrated their overcoming of this trial......`
`".........He jumped down from the third story...? ......And he's alright...?`
` He jumped down......and escaped from the closed room...?`
` Th, this is ridiculous......This isn't reasoning.........it's insane!!"`
`If Battler had at least been seriously injured and writhing in the mud,`
` ......Erika might still have had some ground to stand on.`
` She might have been able to claim that Kinzo couldn't have jumped down with his old body and gotten away unscathed.`
`......However, Battler stood calmly in the courtyard, looking up at Erika with the dignity of the victor.`
`"Everyone, I, ...I'll ask one more time.`
` ......This is...impossible, right?`
` There's no way a human could jump down from a third story and land unharmed...!! `
`Isn't that right, everyone...?!`
` Much less Kinzo-san jumping down from the third floor at his age!! This isn't reasoning!!"`
`Erika tried to get everyone's agreement and somehow turn things around,`
` ......but their responses were no different from how they had been a short while ago.`
`"No, it would be possible for Kinzo-san."`
`"I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"This is Father we're talking about......"`
`"There're plenty of crazy stories about that man.`
` Somethin' like this wouldn't surprise me at all."`
`"Wh, ......what.........?!!`
` I, ...is there something wrong in your heads, in your minds, people?!?!"`
`"At any rate, ......it looks like your closed room argument wasn't perfect."`
`"Ah, ......gggrrrrrrrrggh...!!"`
`Not only the servants, but the family members also agreed.`
` They all agreed that there was nothing strange about Kinzo jumping down from a third floor window.`
` J, just who in the world...is this Ushiromiya Kinzo person...?!!`
`"Well, I'll give you 60 points...`
` Kinzo would have done it with a bit more flash in his younger days.`
` It needs some more tweaking."`
`"Oh, and how much should it be tweaked?"`
`"W, well...`
` Umm, ......h, he might have jumped down with me in h, his arms!"`
`"Got it.`
` Next time, I'll jump down with you in my arms."`
`"I, ......if you think you can, just try and do it..."`
`Beato's voice grew very faint, and she gulped.`
` Then, her body suddenly became a group of gold butterflies and crumbled away.`
` It was because many people had rushed up to the window, and she was being bathed with gazes filled with the anti-magic toxin.`
` Beato's body became invisible to them and melted into the air...`
` So to their eyes, it appeared that Battler was standing all alone out in the courtyard...`
`"Battleeeeeeeeer!! You okaaaaaaaaay?!!"`
`"I, it looks like he's alright...! Thank goodness!"`
`"......I have LOST...`
`......In that case, for the benefit of those people in the study as well, ......deliver the final blow to ME. `
`Use your final blue truth to show how Kinzo escaped from the closed room of that STUDY."`
`There was no pain in Dlanor's expression.`
`...Pleasure and pain never showed up on her face in the first place.`
` However, she used her longsword as a crutch as she painfully rose to her feet, so it was easy to tell that she had taken heavy damage.`
` And despite her lack of an expression, you could tell that this was a loss she could accept.`
` Battler and Dlanor turned to face each other.`
`"Here I go."`
`"Yes, COME. `
`............"`
`As though readying herself, Dlanor quietly closed her eyes, but she still stood tall and maintained her air of dignity.`
`"This is my blue truth."`
`The blue power gathered.`
`......Battler slowly approached Dlanor.`
` Then, he faced the rainy sky and yelled out the blue truth.`
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo escaped from the study through the window when Natsuhi oba-san couldn't see him. `
`Natsuhi oba-san didn't notice and locked the window. `
`This way, Natsuhi oba-san saw Grandfather go to bed, and Grandfather was able to escape from the study without contradicting the lock of the window or the door sealed by the receipt. `
`I have just demonstrated that it was physically possible for him to escape. `
`Therefore, this battle is over!!}"`
`The blue wedge flashed through the courtyard along with a blue bolt of lightning,`
` and roared down towards Dlanor's forehead as she stared up at the sky.`
`"............ah."`
`".........Beato's game isn't easy.`
` It's even doubtful whether the fallbacks of the mystery genre even work here.`
` Your swordsmanship isn't bad, but you should be a bit more flexible in your thinking."`
`......A massive blue wedge which looked like a pillar......was above Dlanor's forehead...`
`...and had stopped with its tip just slightly touching her.`
` It didn't run her through.`
`......It made no mark larger than being poked with a pencil.`
` When Battler snapped his fingers, the blue wedge shattered and became a shower of translucent gems,`
` .........no, drops of rain that poured down over the courtyard.`
` Dlanor sat down in an absent sort of way...`
` Amidst the thunder and rain, `
`the successor to the Ushiromiya family faced the people staring down from the study`
` and......spread his arms wide...`
`".........Welcome to Beato's and my game.`
` Welcome, Furudo Erika......!"`
`"Ahhaha, ......`
`.........Ahhahhahhahha, kahhahhahhahhahha...!!`
` I like it, Ushiromiya Battler...!`
` <Good>, truly <good>...!!`
` Ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` I'll chew it to bits, `
`this riddle of the witch...!!`
` All the way deep into its guts while it's still alive!!`
` Ahhahhahhahhahhahahahahehyahhahahahha!!"`
`Battler and Beato both looked calmly up at Erika, who couldn't contain that evil laugh......`
`"Ohhohohohohohohoho, ooohohohohohohohohyahhyaaaahhh!!`
` Ah, this is good stuff!!`
` Erika, that was so laaaame, ehihhahhahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"G......gah.........`
` L, Lady Bernkastel...`
`......M, my apolo...gies......"`
`"That face of yours.`
` ......It's so incredibly laughable that I'd like to smash it and put a frame around it. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, my double is so...pathetic, pathetic, lame, lame, heheheheheheheehehehehihhhihihihihihhihahahyhahahahahahaha!!"`
`Bathed in the sneers of Bernkastel, the being who was like a mother to her,`
` ......Erika was so ashamed that it looked as though she'd chew her lower lip to pieces...`
`"......This......resentment...will definitely...`
`......definitely.........`
` Gwaaaaaaahhh......!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler...`
`......Beatrice......`
`......Ushiromiya...`
`.........Natsuhiiiiiiiiiii.....`
`...iihhihihihihihihihihi...!! `
`Hihyahhahahahahahahaahahaaah!!"`
`"This riddle is ours.`
` ......I won't let anyone get in the way...!! Beatrice!!"`
`"Y, ......yes!"`
