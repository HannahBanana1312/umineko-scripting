`*knock*knock*knock*knock*!!! `
`The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses.`
` She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day.`
` But...what could it be...? `
`At a time like this...`
` More importantly, the knock itself was strange.`
` If someone had tried to contact her, they could have just used the internal phone line.`
` She had told them that she would be here.`
` Realizing that something strange was going on,`
` Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness.`
`"Father, Father...!!`
` It's Eva.`
` I have something urgent and vital to talk to you about!"`
`It was Eva's voice.`
`......What is this? `
`I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse.`
` So why is Eva here...?! `
`Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice.`
`".........What is it? You're too noisy."`
`"Natsuhi nee-san...?!`
` Why are you in Father's study at this hour?!"`
`"......I told you to be quiet!`
` Have you forgotten that the head likes peace and silence more than anything else...?!"`
`"Now's not the time to be saying that!!`
` Stop harping on that and open up quickly!!`
` Bring Father out!!"`
`"The head just went to sleep!`
` I don't know what business you have, but I will listen to it tomorrow!"`
`"I don't have any business with you!!`
` Just open up right now!!"`
`Sometimes, multiple schemes and hypotheses can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.`
` This is bad...`
` If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study.`
` Now, I can't even open this door...! `
`At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.`
` I, it's alright.`
` Both of the keys to the study are here.`
` No one can open this door...! `
`Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver...`
`"H, ...hello!!`
` It's Natsuhi!"`
`"It's me...`
` Things are bad.`
` I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."`
`It was from Krauss.`
` His tone was strained.`
`......What in the world happened...?!`
`"It seems that Battler-kun and the guest called Erika...`
`......solved the witch's epitaph and found the gold."`
`"Huh? ...............`
`...Is, ...is that true?!"`
`"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in.`
` They're saying that Battler-kun will show everyone the way to the location of the hidden gold..."`
`"Right now, Eva-san is just outside the door, yelling at me to open it...!`
` If I open it now, she might push her way into the study...!!"`
`"...I, I understand.`
` I will go there too.`
` Don't worry about Eva.`
` Just stay there and don't do anything...!`
` I'll give you a signal once I've gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that.`
` Ready...?!"`
`Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji.`
` A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down."`
`In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal.`
`......Krauss had skillfully pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her.`
` During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door...`
` Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment, `
`but the heavy sound of the auto-lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed.`
`"The gold of the epitaph has been found!`
` It's only natural that we should inform Father...!!`
` Or else what?`
` Is there some reason you can't tell Father about this?!"`
`"Father gave strict orders that he not be awakened--no matter what--after he went to bed.`
` Following those orders is the duty of the head's representative. `
`Isn't that right, Genji-san?"`
`".........Yes.`
` The Master's sleep must not be disturbed, no matter the circumstances."`
`"Even that rule depends on the time and circumstances, doesn't it...?!!`
` I mean, the epitaph was solved!!`
` Father has a right to know straight away!"`
`"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the head tomorrow.`
` That's our duty as the head's representatives."`
`"I don't care about that!!`
` Come on, just open this door!!`
` Let me see Father!! `
`Father, Father, can you hear me?`
` It's Eva!!`
` Please open up!!"`
`"Owowow, let go of me...!!`
` Th, that hurts...!!"`
`"We're telling you to listen to us......!`
` Don't knock on the door so loudly......!!"`
`"Ouch, owowowowow...!!`
` Let go, let go of me!!"`
`"Krauss-sama, Eva-sama.`
` The Master is sleeping.`
` Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"`
`When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle.`
` It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva...`
` Eva put her argument aside for the time being.`
` She could worry about that after seeing the gold with her own eyes.`
` Eva hadn't seen it for herself either.`
` Natsuhi and the others had managed to deal with this crisis somehow.`
`......However, the move of the demons, which would sneer upon their efforts, ...had already begun...`
`"Battler.........solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say......?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer.`
` Erika has proclaimed that she will abandon her rights to the Golden Land.`
` ......Therefore, Battler is the one who reached the Golden Land."`
`".........Fate can be truly interesting.`
` To think that Battler-sama would reach that place..."`
`"What will you do, Beato?`
` ......You made a promise to stop the ceremony if anyone solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Yes.`
` ...That was the deal."`
`"............That was the deal.`
` Hmm."`
`"Apparently, Battler-sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land.`
` ......It now seems that no one will become our master."`
`"That is also fate.`
` It has been several decades since we first manifested in the human world through our bond with Lord Goldsmith.`
` ......It was all very fun."`
`".........Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady. `
`......So, what're we going to do?`
` According to Riiche and Goldsmith's rules, now that Battler's solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master,`
` we've been relieved from duty, right?"`
`"That's true.`
` ......I have no regrets at all.`
` I've been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."`
`"Wait.`
` We can't let that happen. `
`......You might not have any regrets, but I will keep on serving Natsuhi.`
` To let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph would be quite irresponsible.`
` ......Witches aren't allowed to break contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."`
`"......True.`
` We should serve her until the family conference ends."`
`"In that case, you won't be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord Goldsmith.`
` ......Perhaps you should wait until you've overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi-sama at the very least,`
` ......and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."`
`"............Hmm.`
` ......She has done well supporting my foolish son."`
`"Aren't you a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off?`
` Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ......That is also fitting.`
` Natsuhi might be worthy to bear my wing. `
`...However, .........we are approaching the critical moment.`
` ......Your reward is waiting for you.`
` Try and overcome this test safely......, Natsuhi..."`
`The mountain of gold left everyone speechless.`
` Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence, `
`......no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked...`
`".........To think that a place like this existed........."`
`"I can't believe it......`
`......That Dad........."`
`Everyone was stunned by the gold.`
` The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi.`
` Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold.`
` Then he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek.`
`"W, wahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Th, this is incredible!`
` It's the real thing!!"`
`"......H, ......hahahahahahaha!!`
` That damn Dad, sticking this much gold into such a ridiculous place!!"`
`"Now that we have this much...`
`...we no longer...`
` have anything to fear...`
` With this, `
`......we could overcome any kind of trial......!`
` Rosaaa......!!"`
`"Nee-san......, Nee-san......`
` We'll be able to find happiness with this, right......?"`
`Eva and Rosa started walking towards each other at the same time and hugged each other as they broke down crying...`
` Ecstasy and shock...wonder and sighs.`
` After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that caused these mixed emotions,`
` ......Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show.`
`".........If this world is money, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness.`
` ......Congratulations, everyone.`
` I pray that this discovery makes all of your lives richer."`
`"I take my hat off to you......`
`......To think that you would solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."`
`".........If you couldn't solve it in a single day, then you wouldn't be able to solve it no matter how many days you had.`
` After all, it doesn't take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition.`
` ......Also, I wouldn't have been able to solve this riddle myself.`
` I ask that you praise Battler-san's achievement as well, everyone."`
`".................."`
`"......I abandon any rights to this discovery.`
` I'm already satisfied to have my reasoning proven correct.`
` Therefore, I want to give Battler-san the full credit for discovering the gold."`
`"......I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I am not.`
` Battler-san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of the cousins would notice.`
` That can only mean one thing.`
` ......He must have wanted to begin the true family conference with all of you."`
`"......Erika.`
` Quit deciding things on your own."`
`"My apologies.`
` ............In that case, I'll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings.`
` So, who will take my place?"`
`Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone.`
`......After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move.`
`"None of us have forgotten the deal we made earlier today, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Divide it between the four of us, with 2.5 billion for each.`
` And then the successor to the head gets another 10 billion."`
`".........W, wait a second!`
` Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the successor to the head?!"`
`"Hold up, you won't be able to get away with that, Natsuhi-san...!!`
` We've all been arguing based on that premise the whole time, haven't we?!`
` You really think you can pretend that never happened now?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` ......Weren't you the one worrying about how if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the successor to the head...?"`
`"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that's the truth, right?!"`
`"You bastard!!! `
`We were all aware of it, weren't we?!!"`
`"That's right, Aniki!`
` Are you going to change your position this late in the game?!"`
`"Though it was never stipulated, I believe it was most definitely common knowledge between us.`
` I don't see how you can call it completely irrelevant."`
`"You can't just interpret the head's epitaph however you like!!`
` Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the successor?!`
` The epitaph was decided upon by the head.`
` You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"`
`".........Calm down, Natsuhi."`
`"How could I calm down?!`
` I certainly find it very impressive that Battler-kun solved the epitaph!`
` I don't care what kind of reward he gets.`
` However, saying that reward should be half of everything here is clearly a stretch,`
` and you won't get away with the argument that the discoverer is the next head...!!"`
`"Th, that's low, Natsuhi nee-san...! `
`This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"`
`"I agree!`
` Though it was never stipulated, the fact that the guy who solves the epitaph becomes the next head has always been the greatest unwritten assumption between us...!`
` It's not fair if you start complaining about that at the last second, right?`
` Yeah, it isn't fair!!"`
`"Anyway!! `
`This gold is Father's!!`
` We can't decide how it will be split up without Father's permission!!"`
`"No way!!`
` That's low, Natsuhi-san!`
` We were talking about this on and on earlier, right?!`
` Are you saying that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?!`
` That's just not right!!"`
`"Why don't we just vote on it?!!`
` Battler-kun, the one who found the gold, is the successor to the head!`
` My husband and I have no objections!!`
` What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie-san?`
` Rosa?!"`
`"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"`
`"I have no objections either.`
` Battler-kun is the true successor, chosen by the epitaph. `
`If you aren't satisfied, then why don't we just ask Father directly...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Like you just said, Natsuhi nee-san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And he's also the proper owner of this gold. `
`In that case, shouldn't we talk to Father about this directly?`
` How should Battler-kun, the person who discovered the gold, be treated?`
` I believe Father is the only one capable of deciding that...!"`
`"B, ...but......!!"`
`"......Didn't I tell you to calm down? ........."`
`"Rosa and Kyrie-san are right.`
` Let's ask Father!!`
` Your turn is already up, Nii-san, Natsuhi nee-san!!"`
`"Yeah, yeah!! `
`Bring Father out to us!! `
`We won't get anywhere with just you two!`
` Let's begin the real family conference!!`
` Does this look like something you can put off just because he's tired?!`
` If we take this thing lightly, we'll have a massive problem on our hands...!`
` Hey, are you listening?!! `
`We won't get anywhere with just you!!`
` Bring Father out right noooooow!!!"`
`"............Are family conferences always like this?"`
`"......How the hell'd I know?"`
`"They're probably always like this on the inside.`
` .........Heheheheh.`
` Looks like they won't be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo-san.`
` ......To think he's being called out to settle his children's fight even though it's been announced that he has only a short while to live.`
` ......I wonder how he feels right about now.`
` ......*giggle*.`
` Imagining that...no, reasoning that out will be a treat."`
`The parents ignored Battler and Erika...and kept yelling at each other, on and on...`
` Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he had seen it.`
` He had suspected it since six years ago,`
` and he'd been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents' faces when this time of year drew near...`
` However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes...`
`...was much more...`
`...ugly than he had imagined...`
` That's why he was very glad that he'd called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything......`
` Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break.`
` It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion...`
` This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no heating, and it was a little cold.`
` It wasn't well suited for a long conversation.`
` They thought of the possibility that someone might snatch the gold away while their backs were turned,`
` but of course, no one could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when it's 10 tons of gold they're dealing with.`
` In fact, it might be said that having this mountain of gold in the background was actually robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions.`
` So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more ruthlessly......`
`"......Then, if you would excuse me for the night.`
` ......I imagine I would just get in the way if I remained any longer."`
`"Sure, sorry.`
` Did we bother you too much?"`
`"Let us show our gratitude again tomorrow.`
` Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."`
`"You said that you refused, `
`but allow us to prepare a fitting portion, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold.`
` Right, Nii-san?"`
`"......Yes.`
` We know what you're capable of.`
` I think you can grasp our current circumstances."`
`20 billion yen in gold isn't something they wanted out in the open.`
` They didn't want an outsider like Erika telling people about it.`
` Of course, Erika had already 'reasoned out' that much.`
` She'd worn an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she'd understood all too well...`
`"......You don't need to worry about me.`
` Of course, I have no desire to tell anyone else about this.`
` ......And if I did, no one would believe me without proof."`
`".........I got to see something interesting tonight.`
` It was quite a spectacle, so I'm more than satisfied."`
`"Heheh, I see.`
` I guess it's not every day you see 10 tons of gold."`
`......Seeing the gold was the spectacle?`
` Of course not.`
` Judging by Erika's dark nature, it's obvious what she's so happy about.`
` I thought about telling her to just go away, but I wanted to leave this all behind me myself...`
` I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika.`
` However, Kyrie-san grabbed my shoulder.`
`"You can't go, Battler-kun.`
` Please come with us."`
`"Yes, yes.`
` You're now a real successor to the head!`
` You've got to have an audience with Father and have him acknowledge you right away...!"`
`"Father is the only one who gets to decide that!!`
` Don't make things up on your own!"`
`"......Battler.`
` I know it might be a pain, but stick around with us for a little while longer. `
`Don't say anything.`
` Just stay quiet and keep your head down.`
` Got it?"`
`"............Just do whatever you want."`
`It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being successor to the head.`
`......But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire.`
` Even if I hadn't been ordered to keep quiet, staying shut up like a clam is almost certainly a good idea...`
` In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...? `
`Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him it was uncomfortable and to let go.`
` However, he didn't pay attention to a word I said...`
`".........I've solved the epitaph.`
` Just like you wanted."`
`".................."`
`"When you were the Game Master, we'd always get those letters.`
` ......'Try and solve the epitaph'.`
` 'If you don't, I'll kill all of you'."`
`".................."`
`.........Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph? `
`By solving it, we found a mountain of gold.`
` Yippee for us.`
` And what about Beato?`
`......Does she gain anything......by having us find the gold? `
`Or does she lose something...?`
`"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ......people don't make moves which cause them to lose something.`
` That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."`
`"No. `
`{p:1:This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph.}"`
`".........Are you sure that's alright?`
` ...Using red like that without her permission."`
`"......This child most likely wishes for it."`
`Virgilia, who had suddenly appeared there, quickly gave me an answer to my question with the red truth...`
`"In the past, I sometimes guessed that the reason Beato was trying to make us solve the epitaph`
` was that she wanted to make us find the gold's hiding place for her so that she could snatch it away.`
` .........Is that wrong too?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......In the first place, `
`{p:1:the gold of the Golden Land belongs to this child.} `
`{p:1:She had absolutely no need to make you find it for her or to snatch it away herself.}"`
`Of course.`
`......Beato is Beatrice the Golden.`
` Isn't she the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist?`
`...That totally makes sense.`
` However, that makes me even more confused.`
`......Even if someone exposed the answer to the epitaph's riddle, Beato has nothing to gain.`
` No, to the contrary, her own gold might be stolen away.`
`"In that case, I'm understanding this less and less.`
` .........I understand the epitaph murders.`
` It might be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ceremony to revive her powers as a witch. `
`...After all, she's probably doing it because of some reason or goal of her own."`
`".................."`
`"But what's the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph?`
` Whether we solve it or not, she has nothing to gain at all. `
`......In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not is immaterial in Beato's eyes."`
`"......You're right. `
`{p:1:Whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, this child stands nothing to gain at all.}"`
`"It doesn't matter whether it's solved or not.`
` ......In other words, could we say that the epitaph's riddle itself is immaterial to Beato...?"`
`"............`
`......You're right. `
`The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child.`
` So even if you take it to an extreme and call the epitaph's riddle immaterial, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."`
`".................."`
`Beato......`
`......Why are you making us solve the epitaph's riddle...? `
`If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate...`
` And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate.`
` For some reason, she's saying that she'll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved.`
`......In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle are worth the same to Beato.`
` Like two sides on a balanced scale.`
` That means that both the epitaph's riddle and massacring all the relatives...`
` are equally significant from Beato's point of view......`
` But Virgilia responded with the red text.`
`{p:1:Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain.}`
`If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph's riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato.`
` In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph's riddle in value...`
`......worth to her...?`
`......Think, don't stop thinking......`
` The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth.`
` As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato's goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her.`
` X=Y.`
` And whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain.`
` Y=0.`
` So, in this case, ......what is X......?`
`".................."`
`"......Wait a sec.`
` ......That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."`
`"......Every time she performs that bizarre serial murder,`
` she's willing to spend an incredible amount of effort on politely sending an advance notice `
`and then killing us one by one in accordance with the epitaph without getting exposed.`
` So all of that is meaningless to her...?"`
`I turned the chessboard over and searched through Beato's moves over and over.`
` This is always the first place I stumble.`
` The significance of the epitaph murders.`
` Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch's epitaph? `
`If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it would be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner`
` or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping.`
` However, on the first evening, Beato sent us a letter that sounded like an advance notice`
` and then carried out a three part serial murder with large gaps in between `
`the six people of the first twilight, the two people of the second twilight, and the five people of the fourth and later twilights.`
` We aren't fools.`
` Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders.`
` Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other's alibis.`
` As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically,`
` and Beato's chances of success in this serial murder drop closer and closer to zero...`
` All of the epitaph murders......are like she's strangling her own neck, making it harder to succeed in the serial murder.`
` ......All for a useless ornament......all just for show.`
`".........She's raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."`
`"That does follow.`
` ......She really is a strange child."`
`"Did you know?`
` In mystery novels, they call things like these epitaph murders 'plotline murders'.`
` ......I think you can split the possible reasons for these plotline murders into three groups."`
`"......And what are those?"`
`"The first would be the benefit the culprit receives by following the epitaph and thereby confusing the evidence and alibis.`
` ......Pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims fits this pattern,`
` as does committing murders that don't follow the epitaph and making the others get the order wrong, so that you can give yourself an alibi."`
`"I see.`
` So perhaps she only made it look as though she was killing them in a ceremony following the epitaph......when she was actually guiding their thinking in a manner that benefited her.`
` That sounds interesting."`
`".........However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red.`
` ...While she might have confused them in the world of the game board, she can't confuse us up here in the same way.`
` ......In other words, the most obvious possible goal for her...isn't the real one."`
`"In that case, what are the other two reasons for carrying out the plotline murders?"`
`"Another one is coincidence.`
` ......A crime carried out without any particular intention just happens to look similar to the epitaph,`
` and the witnesses mistakenly think it's a plotline murder.`
` Humans try to find cause and effect in everything they see.`
` ......If we think we know what something is, then that's how it looks to us."`
`"......I see.`
` That's also interesting. `
`...However, it seems a bit odd.`
` In this child's games, there's always an advance notice of the crime given before the murders of the first twilight.`
` Also, I believe you find letters and circumstantial evidence one after another that clearly show the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` .........It isn't coincidence.`
` From the very beginning, Beato has been proceeding with a goal of making this look like a series of epitaph murders. `
`We weren't mistaken about that.`
` These are clear 'plotline murders'.`
` That's why this can't be the reason either."`
`"In that case, ......there's only one reason left, right?"`
`"The last one.........is to show someone something.`
` In other words, to make them feel fear.`
` ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue.`
` The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they're certain will continue."`
`".................."`
`"In other words, `
`......this child performed these epitaph murders to make someone feel the fear of death?"`
`"At least, ...putting it that way, everything makes sense, more or less.`
` ......The grotesque mutilation done to the corpses and the dark decorations were all a show to terrify someone......"`
`"To terrify whom......?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Well, us, of course. `
`.................."`
`After hearing that one line Virgilia spoke so casually, ......my thoughts clouded over once again...`
` Is it really enough to just use `
`the vague word 'us'......? `
`There are many humans in the Ushiromiya family.`
` There's the head and the one who holds the rank of his successor...Grandfather and Krauss oji-san.`
` The relatives, who have some pull in the business world.`
`......On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year,`
` and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty.`
`......Even if the culprit hated all of us,`
` ......they probably didn't hate all of us equally.`
` In other words, they might have made it clear which of those among us they particularly wanted to take revenge against and terrify.`
` If we liken this to a kid eating dessert......`
` Isn't the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last? `
`No one tells you that you shouldn't eat it first, but our mentality leads us into saving it for later.`
`".........In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end. `
`......Yeah, similar to what was said by my favorite character in this novel I like.`
` Something about how the worst way to kill someone is to 'start by killing the people closest to them, `
`make them feel that sadness, then kill that person in the end'."`
`"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel.`
` How frightening......"`
`"......In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most.`
` ......However, every single time, the order people are killed in gets totally changed. `
`......If we try counting up the people who live until the last twilight every single time...`
` even though they do die in the end...`
`............`
`..............."`
`".................."`
`......I'm the only one.`
`".........Let me first speak with the red. `
`{p:1:Battler-kun isn't the culprit.} `
`{p:1:Battler-kun didn't kill anyone.} `
`{p:1:This can be said of all games.}"`
`"Then that.........just makes it even more likely that it's me.`
` ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show it to me."`
`Every time, Beato brags that she chooses who to kill next with a roulette.`
` However, I am the only one she never kills.`
`......Though she does kill me in the end, she leaves me be until the very last moment.`
` In all of these supposedly random games, there's only this one unchanging constant......`
`"She wants.........revenge? Against me?`
` So is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"`
`"That's wrong. `
`......{p:1:Her goal is not to make someone experience fear.} `
`{p:1:And it isn't to have revenge on someone either.}"`
`"In that case!`
` That means the epitaph murders really don't mean anything to her.`
` The epitaph's riddle is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless.`
` X=Y=0!`
` But even so, she's clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"`
`"What could she want from me...which is worth the same to her as something meaningless?!`
` ......I don't get it!!`
` The more I think about it, the less I understand what she's thinking!"`
`".................."`
`Beatrice,`
` the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless serial murder.`
` Even the epitaph's riddle, which that witch made into a condition to suspend the serial murders...`
` is meaningless, immaterial.`
` And, ......she's thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face.`
`......What is it......that you want from me...?`
`......Or else, what is it that you want to give me......? `
`My idea that Beato must have been taking revenge on me...has already been denied by Virgilia's red truth.`
` Both X and Y.`
` Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle mean nothing to Beato.`
` X=Y=0.`
` However, since she's thrusting that in front of me...`
`...it must...`
`...have some meaning.`
` She showed us the scales representing 'if you don't solve the epitaph, I'll carry out the epitaph murders'.`
` In other words, neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph's riddle have any significance by themselves.`
` However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and thrusts it out before us.........no, before me.`
`......In other words, it should be like this:`
`X=0.`
` Y=0.`
` X+Y>0.`
` A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides.`
` However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning.`
`"......It's almost like......playing.`
` Like kids playing rock, paper, scissors."`
`Rock, paper, scissors is an extremely familiar method to randomly determine a winner and a loser.`
` You sometimes bet some sort of privilege on the outcome,`
` ......but kids often do rock, paper, scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular.`
` Unless you bet something, you have nothing to gain or lose except happiness and frustration.`
` In other words, the two sides of the scale, both winning and losing, are immaterial.`
` However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip...`
` is the reason kids play rock, paper, scissors.`
` After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game,`
` ......and they aren't purely interested in the value of winning or losing.`
` They aren't overly concerned about who wins and who loses......`
`"That would mean that it doesn't matter to Beato......whether the epitaph murders succeed or not.`
` ......It almost feels like she's just enjoying the process."`
`"............"`
`"......In the past, ...I cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason.`
` ......But right now, I can't imagine that's true."`
`".........Thank you.`
` In that case, I'll give you some more red. `
`...{p:1:Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure.}"`
`She didn't do it for pleasure, and she didn't do it to make anyone feel fear.`
` Since she has nothing to gain, `
`she doesn't care whether the epitaph murders succeed or fail.`
` It's almost like...a random game kids would play......`
`"That's not right.`
` ......It does have meaning.`
` It has meaning for her."`
`".........And what is...this meaning...?"`
`"I don't get it.`
` Even though both sides of the scale are immaterial, ......the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."`
`......Of course it isn't meaningless.`
` Some meaning definitely exists.`
` In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago.`
`......Could that have been meaningless too? `
`No.`
` That definitely isn't the case.`
` I clearly remember the serious gaze Beato had back then.`
` Unfortunately, I didn't have a clue at the time.`
`......When she saw that, she was horribly dejected.`
` That's right.`
` At that time, I'm sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn't have occurred if I hadn't come.`
`"It does have meaning.`
` .........It means something to her. `
`And it's something she wants from me."`
`"........................"`
`I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head,`
` ......then patted her head.`
`"......Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest that you just write 'I love you'.`
` ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out."`
`".........*giggle*."`
`"I still don't have a clue what she's thinking.`
` ......Even so, `
`I won't stop thinking.`
` ...I've only just started turning the chessboard over.`
` ......I definitely won't give up......on this journey in search of your thoughts."`
