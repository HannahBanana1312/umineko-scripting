`......Battler did nothing but gaze lazily out the window.`
` The fighting between the relatives continued without end......`
` At first, the relatives had crowded around the study.`
` However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once.`
` Eva and several others said that they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held.`
` However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he'd previously given Genji, `
`meaning that he now had both keys himself.`
` She claimed that this was the reason they couldn't open the door.`
` After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall.`
` But, of course, the argument continued on even after they returned to the dining hall.`
` Eva's group wanted a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up.`
`......Apparently, Battler's solving of the epitaph threatened Krauss's position as the next head,`
` which gave the others a huge tailwind.`
` On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi based their argument on the claim `
`that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph.`
` It hadn't been hidden gold, but just Kinzo's stockpile,`
` and it was still Kinzo's property, which meant it was only natural that it be distributed only after Kinzo's death with the rest of the inheritance.`
` After they claimed this, Eva's group once again started demanding that they be allowed to see Kinzo.`
`......It's probably been obvious from the beginning.`
` This sibling fight can only be settled by Kinzo...`
` It was obvious that this confrontation was between Eva's group, which wanted cash fast,`
` and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn't need money right away.`
` As he listened vaguely to this exchange,`
` ......Battler marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were surprisingly deep in debt...`
`"Didn't you already say that a short while ago? `
`That's enough, let's take a break.`
` We're all repeating the same things over and over again."`
`According to the clock, it was almost 24:00.`
` It certainly was a perfect time for a break.`
` The atmosphere relaxed just a bit...`
`"I agree.`
` It'd do both sides some good to take a breather. `
`...So, why don't we take a record down for the rest.`
` I've had enough of fighting over what was or wasn't said."`
`"Seriously.`
` We really can't do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii-san can so easily deny something he's said before the words stop bouncing off the walls."`
`"With a written record, just writing it would be a pain, and it'd be open to forgery."`
`"Right.`
` ......Aniki, want to fire this up?"`
`"A tape set, is it? `
`...I see.`
` This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible.`
` It's fair for both sides."`
`"Make sure you don't mess anything up...!`
` Those are Father's precious music tapes!"`
`The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it which matched this majestic dining hall perfectly.`
` On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records.`
` However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around...`
` Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape.`
` And every time he found some tape with 'sophisticated' music, he would chuckle at how pompous it was.`
`"Pardon me.`
` ......You called?"`
`"We're taking a break.`
` Sorry, but could you make us something to drink?`
` And maybe some biscuits would be nice too."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will prepare it right away......"`
`"Also, ......sorry.`
` Do you have any cold medicine?`
` I've been feeling a bit feverish."`
`"Then don't overstrain yourself.`
` Get some sleep."`
`"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa?`
` Though I wouldn't step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold."`
`"Really?`
` Allow me to take a rest as well. `
`Natsuhi, why don't we take a short rest too."`
`"............Yes, dear."`
`Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up.`
`......Even if this hadn't been the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she'd have taken any excuse.`
` Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ......and the tension in the room truly relaxed.`
`"............*sigh*."`
`"You've been doing great, Battler-kun.`
` ......I imagine you feel just horrible.`
` Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it."`
`"Just how long am I going to have to sit around doing nothing here?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` After all, you're like our own portable shrine.`
` ......Sleepy?"`
`"About as much as your average school class."`
`"I'm pretty sure Father won't show up tonight anyway.`
` When Krauss nii-san and the rest come back, I'll propose that we might as well let you go."`
`"......I'll be counting on you."`
`*knock*knock*.`
` A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard.`
`"Excuse us......"`
`"We have brought tea."`
`Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart.`
` The pleasant smell of black tea had the effect of relieving a bit of tension.`
`"......Hey.`
` Did you hear about it?"`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"............We didn't hear anything."`
`"Stop it, Rudolf.`
` There's no reason to tell them."`
`"......We are furniture,`
` so we have no interest in the family conference."`
`"I see.`
` That's a wise answer."`
`"......You have the midnight shift?`
` That must be tough."`
`"That is our job.`
` ......We would be happy to receive your orders."`
`"That may be.`
` It'd probably be even more tiresome to sit around awake doing nothing. `
`When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper.`
` Even if you're just staying awake, it's still pretty tough...!`
` Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place.`
` Plus you couldn't rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!"`
`Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he had started with nothing and built up assets by illegally diverting goods from the American army.`
` Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative.`
` The relatives who knew this were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up.`
`"If you got found out, you were in for it big time!`
` Those Americandy people are scary!`
` Their strength's in another league 'cause of all that beef they eat.`
` If you got caught, it would end with them shooting you or <death by hanging>! `
`Get it? <Death by hanging>!`
` Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out.`
` It's all about the meat!`
` Japanese people've got to eat more meat!`
` And that's when I had a revelation that I needed to start up a business to win over people's stomachs!"`
`"I, ...I see...`
` That m, must have been quite a difficult task......"`
`"Stop it, dear.`
` No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they'll never understand how we suffered back then."`
`"Oops, looks like my bad habit's jumped out again...!`
` Sorry, sorry!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"You two should have some tea as well.`
` I think it might be helpful for you to use your own mouth once in a while and learn more about the tea you're brewing."`
`".........No, we'll be fine.`
` There's no need to be concerned for our sakes..."`
`"Hang out with us for a bit.`
` Being surrounded by only adults makes me feel like I'm gonna suffocate."`
`"Hear that? That's an order from Battler-sama, successor to the head!`
` Sit over there and have some tea with us.`
` Then you can talk about recent events, your hobbies, TV shows you're watching and whatever it is that's popular with young folks these days.`
` There's a lot we could learn."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's a brilliant idea.`
` Come on, you two sit down too.`
` And why don't you become sacrifices for us now that we crave something to talk about."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` That's right.`
` I thought it'd be nice to talk to some young kids, but that'll be pretty hard when I'm too old even to go to a cabaret club."`
`"......How long are you planning on standing around there?`
` Rudolf told you to sit.`
` Sit down.`
` ......I give you permission as well."`
`After getting Eva's permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously.`
` For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives' playthings......`
` At that time, *knock*knock*...`
`......a reserved knocking sound could be heard.`
` All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner,`
` so no one noticed anything strange.`
` However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces.`
`......The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda.`
` Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse.`
` Kumasawa had gone to bed in a spare room in the guesthouse.`
` They were in here, ......so Genji was the only person left,`
` ...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn't knock like that......`
`"......Who is it?`
` It's not locked. Just come in."`
`Rudolf didn't recognize the knock either.`
` When he asked 'Who is it?', it became apparent that no one could tell whose knock it was......`
` After that, the same *knock*knock* repeated just once more.`
`......Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...? `
`As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard.`
` It was a sign that October 4th had ended and October 5th had begun......`
` Let's go back in time a bit.`
` At this time, Krauss and Natsuhi were a ways off, in a deserted corridor on the second floor......`
`".........So, we no longer have any other options."`
`"Yes...`
`......The same move probably won't last us all day tomorrow.`
` ...If we hesitate any longer, there's a chance that Eva-san and the others will claim that we have Father locked up and call the police. `
`This is......as far as we can go."`
`".................."`
`"......Battler-kun finding the gold......was totally unexpected.`
` If that hadn't happened, I'd thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow......"`
`"......Hmph.`
` This always happens when I bet on something.`
` ...Something unexpected always happens, and something which should have been an absolute certainty gets all messed up."`
`".........Let's set it up so that Father's room is empty starting tomorrow morning.`
` Let's plan it out with Genji and have him say that he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning."`
`"I doubt Eva and the others will simply accept such a disappearance..."`
`"I'm fully aware of that.`
` However, we have no other options...!"`
`"If we do such a thing, ......Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss that our actions were suspicious.`
` They aren't worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us.`
` ...It might end up in some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me."`
`"We can live with damage, right...?!`
` If by any chance Father's secret is discovered, we won't get away with just damage...!!"`
`"There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last second tomorrow.`
` If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything.`
` There's no need to get impatient and use that trump card...!"`
`"You want to wait until after they start clambering about how we've locked Father up, and then say he's gone missing?`
` That way would invite much more suspicion...!!"`
`"...............Nnnn......"`
`"......Let's just...`
` put Father to rest now...`
` To go any further...`
`......would be impossible......"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` You've just been wrapped up in Eva and the others' toxin and have lost your composure.`
` ......Only two keys exist which can let anyone into that study!`
` And you have both of them right here.`
` That means no one can go inside.`
` That door is of a very special make.`
` No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storehouse, it won't even budge."`
`"It isn't a physical problem like that...!"`
`"Please, don't be hasty, and calm down.`
` In any event, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed.`
` In the meantime, I will overcome all of this for you."`
`"......I can't leave everything to you...!`
` I'll fight until the end too...!"`
`When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ......Krauss held her gently.`
`......Just how long had it been since the last time she'd felt warmth from her husband's compassion......`
`"Your headache.........must be awful, yes?`
` It's always that way when you wrinkle your forehead like that."`
`"............Dear......"`
`She had come to think that her husband could never guess the way she felt.`
` But, ......when it came to times like this.........`
`"......Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card. `
`It's like a last-resort treasured sword.`
` It's best when it remains in its sheath.`
` The important thing is that you're ready to pull it out at any time, right...?"`
`"I......understand that..."`
`"Would you let me handle that trump card?`
` .........Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility.`
` ......I won't get you and Jessica involved."`
`"What...do you mean by that...?!"`
`"When the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed in the rubble.`
` .........When the typhoon passes, let's make sure we're ready to file for divorce.`
` I will sign the papers and let you hold onto them.`
` ......I've secretly left some of my assets in your name.`
` If you add on some compensation money, that should be enough for you and Jessica to live on without any hindrances."`
`"No!! `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...!`
` Please let me be with you until the last moment...! `
`Even if it turns out that you are the last head of the Ushiromiya family, `
`......please let Natsuhi...`
`...be the name of the final head's wife...`
`...your wife......"`
`......Krauss's existence was based solely upon the trust and power of his assets as a financial fixer.`
` If either of those weakened, nothing would remain.`
` If they used the trump card of Kinzo's disappearance, they would lose one of these two essential supports.`
`......It was like offering your right arm in exchange for your neck being cut.`
` It was probably better than losing your neck, but you still might die from the blood loss,`
` and even on the off-chance that you did survive, you would have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn't heal for the rest of your life......`
` Krauss was prepared even for death......`
` Natsuhi understood this, `
`......buried her face in Krauss's chest, `
`...and cried...`
`".........My apologies for interrupting."`
`Genji's sudden voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes.`
` Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her.`
`"Ah, Genji-san.`
` Please don't sneak up on us.`
` ......Do you have some business?"`
`".........Yes.`
` My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam."`
`"To......me......?`
` Dear......"`
`"I don't mind."`
`Krauss left Natsuhi's side, went to a window a short ways off,`
` and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden......`
` Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away.`
`"......What is it?"`
`".........Well... `
`The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam."`
`At that time, she was surprised by a sudden, eerie sound.`
` It was the large clock in the hall announcing 24:00...`
`"You don't mean.........that man......again...?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......What is to be done?"`
`"D, ......did he say what business he had with me?"`
`".........He would not answer.`
` He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly."`
`".................."`
`Again, ......a phone call...from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for what had happened 19 years ago.`
` 19 years ago.`
`......That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born.`
` In Natsuhi's eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense.`
`......For a long time, she had been unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and had been treated very coldly.`
` But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica...`
` and became able to call herself the Ushiromiya successor's wife with her head held high.`
`......So in her eyes, 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi' began 18 years ago.`
`......That's why everything before that, including 19 years ago......contained nothing but hateful memories.`
` And......the last year of that hateful period.........is whispering of revenge...from the other end of the phone......`
`.........I can still......hear the roar of the sea......`
`..................`
`".........What is to be done?"`
`"Transfer it......to my room.`
` ......Don't let my husband know."`
`"......As you wish."`
`From the very beginning, Genji had guessed that she wouldn't want Krauss hearing about this phone call.`
` That's why he had told Natsuhi covertly......`
` Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace......`
` She returned to her room and locked the door.`
`...There's nothing peculiar about that.`
`......In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads.`
` There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room...`
`...This is what she told herself.`
` Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang.`
`...Genji had probably transferred the call.`
` She took a deep breath, readied herself, ............and picked up the receiver.`
`".........Hello........."`
`".................."`
`Again, ......it started with silence.`
` She realized that the person at the other end was trying to irritate her and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry...`
`"Why are you silent...?!`
` I'm hanging up...!"`
`"...Hahahahahahaha...`
`......Don't hang up, Mother.`
` I want to hear your voice a little longer......"`
`Again......that unpleasant voice......`
`"Are you trying to mock me...?!`
` Tell me what you want...!"`
`"I want to play with you, Mother."`
`"...Wh, ......what?`
` What are you talking about?!`
` I have no desire to play with you...!!"`
`"......You're tired from the family conference, right?`
` Is that chronic headache of yours getting to be a pain...?"`
`"Th, that's none of your business...!"`
`Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine...`
`"You get headaches because your head's all stiff.`
` If you go straight to bed like that, you won't be having nice dreams."`
`"Haven't I told you that's none of your business?!!`
` I'm hanging up!!"`
`Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn't...`
` After all, being at the receiving end of a phone call was much better than the alternative.`
`......If she hung up violently,`
` ...this person might then call someone else...`
`"Let's play a bit to help you relax.`
` I won't take up much of your time."`
`"I, ...I have no intention of playing with you......!"`
`"......Your name is Natsuhi, Mother.`
` It has the kanji for a season in it.`
` Pretty nice name.`
` .........However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that doesn't necessarily mean that you like summer.`
` ...Which season do you really like, Mother......?"`
`"You think I'll tell you?"`
`"If you don't, ......I'll hang up.`
` .........Is that alright?"`
`"...Gah, ............"`
`It was clearly a threat.`
`......It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone...`
` anything might happen......`
` Humiliated that she was forced to give in to a threat made by a man whose name she didn't even know, she gave him the answer he wanted......`
`".........I, .........it's Fall."`
`"Why......?"`
`"B, because it's an easy season to pass the time in...!`
` There's no other reason in particular.`
` Are you satisfied now?!"`
`"Yeah, I'm satisfied.`
` ......So, looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine.`
` ......I like Fall too.`
` .........Heheheheheheheheheheheheh..."`
`"......Liar! `
`You just made that up...!"`
`Surely, this man would have done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked.`
`......What is he after?! `
`What's so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?!`
`"It's not nice to call someone a liar.`
` ......I didn't make it up.`
` I already knew that you liked Fall, Mother.`
` .........I can even prove it to you."`
`"Prove.........?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?"`
`"...A clock......?`
` Y, ......yes, there is, but what's your point......?"`
`In Natsuhi's room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design.`
`......Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago.`
`".........It's 0:07 right now.`
` I'm tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!"`
`"Try lifting the clock up."`
`"Wh, why?"`
`".........You just don't know when to shut up.`
` Stop resisting every single time I say something.`
` Just shut up and do what I say."`
`The tone of the man's voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat.`
` It made it clear that he was displeased.`
` At first, this man seemed to have a calm way of speaking, but on the inside, that wasn't the case at all.`
` If she enraged this man even a little more, he would surely show his true nature right away...`
`"......Are you really that eager to make me hang up?`
` Things are best when I'm talking on the phone with you......`
`...I could tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..."`
`"I, I don't know what you're talking about, but please don't get my husband and daughter involved...!`
` I'm listening to everything you say...!"`
`"Then just do what you're told......"`
`Once again, the man threatened her in a low voice, as though warning her not to interrupt again...`
` My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ......and the roar of the sea...`
`......I can't disobey him anymore.`
`.........As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock...`
`".....................?"`
`There lay what appeared to be a single playing card.`
`............? `
`Is it the warranty for the clock.........? `
`Thinking this, she took it and turned it over............`
`"Are you.........wide awake now?"`
`"Eek, ah, `
`......aaaaaaaahhhhh......`
` Wh, `
`wh, wh, `
`why...`
`...why is...`
`...this here...?!?!"`
`"Well, I'll be happy if your headache's gone down a bit.`
` ......Tell me you're happy, Mother."`
`"How did you...?!`
` Why?!`
` How?!"`
`"I want you to tell me you're happy, you murderer.`
` How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit.`
` Do you want that to land on your husband and daughter as well?`
` You don't, do you?`
` You want me to keep quiet, don't you?`
` Yeah, I'll keep quiet. See, aren't you happy?`
` Aren't you happy?!"`
`"Ah, .........gaaaah, I'm happy...I'm happy...!!`
` So please...stop...`
` Don't burden my husband and daughter...!`
` What is it you want?`
` Money?`
` How much?!"`
`"I don't want money.`
` ......My wounds couldn't be healed with any amount of money.`
` But there is a medicine.`
` ......That's right.`
` It's like a kind of ointment.`
` ......Thick, syrupy and dribbling. `
`............And that is...`
` my hatred...`
`...my resentment towards you.`
` ...Slathering myself with that...`
` is the only way to hold back the pain..."`
`Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life.`
` So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream.`
` However, ......this definitely wasn't a dream...`
`"......Y, `
`...you couldn't possibly be...`
`...on this island right now, are you...?"`
`"I am.`
` Didn't I promise you?`
` I said I'd be at the family conference."`
`"That's impossible...!`
` There's no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!"`
`"That's no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here. `
`......And I'm pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon."`
`Her blood froze......`
` Furudo Erika had supposedly been brought here by coincidence...`
` If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by......`
`"Wh, `
`......where...`
`...a, `
`......are you.........?"`
`"......I won't appear in front of anyone until you introduce me.`
` Don't worry.`
` .........Oh yeah, it's useless to try and search for me.`
` Your mansion is huge.`
` You even have a phone system in it.`
` And I'm sure you don't want to meet me, right?`
` ......Or else, do you want to expose me and introduce me to everyone...?`
` Introduce me to Jessica too.`
` ......Tell her I'm her older brother by one year.`
` Heheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"S, stop it......, stay away from Jessica......"`
`"I guess I've scared you a bit too much.`
` That's all from me...for tonight.`
` ......But don't forget.`
` You cannot disobey me.`
` Understand, `
`......Mother?"`
`"......Y, .........yes......"`
`"I'm going to hang up for the night, ......but I have an order to be followed up until tomorrow morning."`
`"Wh, ......what is that.........?"`
`"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make a phone call to anywhere.`
` If a phone call comes for you, you aren't allowed to take it.`
` And you will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep.`
` Then you will wake up at your ordinary time.`
` ............Heheheheheh.`
` It sure is nice to live a healthy life.`
` I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother's body......"`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` I'll sleep right now.`
` I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...!`
` So, let my husband and daughter......!"`
`"As long as you follow my orders, I'll keep your secret, Mother.`
` ......Don't disobey me.`
` ......I'm already very close by to you.`
` I can easily tell whether you've turned your lights off, or whether you're on the phone.`
` ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."`
`"I'll keep it!`
` I'll keep my promise!!`
` So stop it, just stop it!`
` Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"`
`......As she screamed, Natsuhi took the card she had found under the clock, and crushed it up into a little ball.`
` It had a pattern on it like a tarot card...`
`...and also...`
`'{p:0:秋}', the kanji for Fall.........`
` Let's go back in time once again.`
` Right now, it is exactly the same time that the large clock in the hall announces 24:00.`
` Wondering who the person who knocked on the door twice was,`
` ......the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door.`
` Rudolf told them to come in.`
`......But there was no answer.`
` Until the end of that long tone marking the coming of 24:00, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock,`
` they were unable to move in the slightest......`
`"......Maybe their hands are full and they can't open it......"`
`"Maybe.`
` ......But it's a little creepy that they won't say their name."`
`"......Should I open it?"`
`"Open it."`
`Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door......`
`"Ah, ......what's that...?!"`
`"......It's......one of Father's envelopes?"`
`Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway,`
` ......lay the envelope.`
`"There's no one in the hallway.`
` Perhaps they placed this here and left..."`
`The adults flew out into the corridor as well,`
` but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door......`
` Barely an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea.`
` At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot.`
` Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One-winged Eagle on it, and left...`
`"C, ......could it have been...the Master......?!"`
`"......It's not unthinkable.`
` ......Father's pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was."`
`"That's not possible.`
` If that's so, then why didn't Father come in here openly?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Father would probably just suddenly come in here without knocking...`
` The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...?`
` In that case, the only people who could conceivably have left the letter there are Krauss-san, Natsuhi-san, and Genji-san."`
`By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up.`
` Therefore, the cousins in the guesthouse, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika could not have come here.`
` Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren't in this room,`
` one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor.`
` In that case, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there to make it seem like a message from Kinzo...`
`"I see...`
` It'll have something written on it which is supposedly in Father's name, saying that he won't accept Battler as the next head, or something of the sort. `
`Ridiculous.`
` I can't believe you'd try to pull such a childish trick, Nii-san...!"`
`"It's not like I have any interest in being the next head..."`
`"Give it up.`
` That's just your fate.`
` ......Anyway, why don't we read what's inside?"`
`Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and let everyone see the front and back to show that there were no tricks or hidden mechanisms, `
`almost like a magician does before performing his act.`
`"......This envelope is without a doubt Father's?"`
`"Y, ...yes, there's no doubt.`
` Father liked to use this envelope for handwritten letters...`
` What do you think, Shannon-chan?"`
`"Y, yes......`
`......To my eyes as well, ......it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..."`
`"That doesn't mean Father was the one who wrote it.`
` It would be pitifully easy for Nii-san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father's study...!"`
`"Even Krauss-sama would not be able to enter the study easily...`
` It might be hard for him to steal an envelope......"`
`"Let's try opening it.`
` We can think about this later.`
` ......There's something in it.`
` I wonder what."`
`Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly.`
` Then, a folded letter...`
`...and a glittering object fell out.`
`......It was a ring.`
`"Huh?`
` .........Wait a second, ...that ring is......!"`
`Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed at it...`
`"Th, `
`......this is...`
`...Father's ring, isn't it...?!`
` I, it's the Head's Ring!!"`
`"......Wh, ...what in the...!!`
` Seriously?!"`
`"Are you sure it's Father's ring...?`
` Could it be a replica...?"`
`"No, this is the real thing!`
` I've always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday.`
` Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else.`
` ......This is Father's ring, no doubt about it!`
` Why is it here?!"`
`"In that case, was it really Father who wrote this letter...?!"`
`"......Heh, heheheheh.`
` The sender isn't Father.`
` ...It's much more interesting."`
`"Then, ......who is the letter from?"`
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist!`
` .........It's from the Golden Witch, Beatrice-sama......!!"`
`Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written.`
` It really did say that......`
`"I, ......it's from Beatrice......?!"`
`"What's it say......?"`
`"I'll read it.`
` .........<Congratulations>...`
` I acknowledge that Battler-sama spectacularly solved the epitaph's riddle and reached the Golden Land.`
` .........All of the gold belongs to Battler-sama.`
` Furthermore, Battler-sama is the new head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......As proof, ............I send the Head's Ring, ...which Kinzo-sama left in my charge...`
`......Battler-sama, I beg that you take the ring, become the new master of the gold, and lead the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......I sincerely pray that you flourish as the new head............"`
`"......Hah, ......hahah!`
` What the hell...!`
` I see, Dad just won't come out of his study, so Beatrice, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...!`
` Hahaha, hahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"......Battler-kun.`
` You should take that ring.`
` ......This is a special ring to be worn by the family head. `
`.........I don't know who this Beatrice is, `
`but she's watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true successor."`
`"I, ......is that alright...?`
` It's such an important ring......"`
`"Yeah, it's fine.`
` You should wear it proudly on your finger. `
`......Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi nee-san tell you to take it off, you better not do it no matter what...!"`
`All of the relatives, with creepy smiles on their faces, urged Battler to put the ring on his finger...`
` It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand......`
` The ring was heavy and stiff......`
` At that moment, Krauss returned.`
`......Genji came back as well immediately afterwards.`
`"My apologies.`
` It looks like my wife isn't feeling so well, so she's gone to bed early. `
`.........Did something happen?`
` You all seem incredibly flustered."`
`"............Battler-sama, ......that is........."`
`Immediately, Genji keenly spotted that which Battler had just put on his finger...`
`"Your eyesight's pretty good, Genji-san!`
` ......Looks like you know whose ring this is."`
`"What...?`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`Judging by Krauss's dubious expression, it's pretty unlikely that he was the one who set that letter there......`
` Furthermore, that expression quickly changed into one of shock.`
`"Eheheheheh!!`
` That's right, it's the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring!! `
`The family conference took up this new topic......,`
` and the storm came once again.........`
` The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever.`
`......This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which made me feel a bit depressed.`
`......Oh wait...given the time, that's today, not tomorrow...`
` But that doesn't really matter now.`
`.........I'm sleepy...`
` With half-asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella.`
` The large drops of rain pounded against it mercilessly.........`
` Technically, the end of the family conference had been proclaimed at 1:00 AM, `
`but external scuffles kept continuing sluggishly.`
` I'm really jealous of Rosa oba-san, who managed to slip out of there at that time.`
` She cleverly got away by saying that she'd check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late.`
` Dad caught me, I missed my chance to escape......`
`...and they made me stick around until now, 3:00 AM...`
` After all this time, what have they decided on...? `
`They haven't decided on anything.`
`......They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids.`
`......I'm sure that they're tired too.`
` I'm sure that's why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions.`
` I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them.`
` I guess no painkiller works better than drowsiness...`
`......I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse.`
` When I returned to the guesthouse, the first floor lounge was lit.`
` Not only that. I could even hear people chatting inside......`
` Apparently, some people were still awake this late.`
` Despite this late hour, Gohda-san and Doctor Nanjo were still awake and chatting.`
` Plates and cups were lined up on the counter,`
` and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda-san as the bartender.`
` When they noticed I had returned, they apparently finally realized how late it was.`
` When Gohda-san made to top off Doctor Nanjo's glass, Doctor Nanjo declined with an exaggerated gesture.`
`"That's enough, that's enough.`
` ......It's already too late to be up."`
`"Look how late it's gotten...`
` You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed."`
`"If so, it's all thanks to your liquor.`
` We'll have to do this again sometime."`
`"Yes, gladly! `
`Battler-sama, welcome back.`
` Is the discussion with Krauss-sama and the others still continuing?"`
`"......From the way things were going, it looks like they might plod on until dawn.`
` None of my business..."`
`I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn.`
`".........They have quite a lot of stamina.`
` I'm surprised."`
`"Oh, ......so you're here too..."`
`"......With one thing and another, they ended up having a small night party here.`
` They let me join in.`
` .........Don't worry, I haven't said a word about *that*."`
`".................."`
`Erika could be seen on the sofa.`
` She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place.`
`"Erika-sama is very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects.`
` I enjoyed listening to her immensely."`
`"Your knowledge truly is extensive.`
` Very impressive for one so young..."`
`".........You're very welcome.`
` I, Furudo Erika, know quite a bit about trifles such as this."`
`Erika grabbed the corners of her skirt and posed.`
` This was somewhat less than graceful considering she was lounging on the sofa with her feet up.`
`"......Where's Rosa oba-san?"`
`"She returned at 1:00 AM, but she went straight upstairs to sleep."`
`That's probably true...`
` After taking part in that conference for so long...`
` I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself.`
`......I've had it.`
` I'm tired enough that I might flop over right here...`
`".........Well then, let's call it a night.`
` Don't you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda-san?"`
`"Preparations for breakfast have already been made.`
` I would be most pleased if you look forward to tomorrow's breakfast."`
`In Gohda-san's eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills.`
` Maybe this invigorates him so much that he doesn't even get sleepy.`
` Erika stood up, laughing at how youthful Gohda was.`
` This became a sign that it was time to disperse.`
`"I will clean up here.`
` Please, go and sleep, everyone."`
`Leaving the clean-up to Gohda-san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor.`
`"Goodnight, everyone.`
` These old bones have stayed up a little too late."`
`".........Good night, Doctor Nanjo.`
` Good night, Battler-san."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........G'night..."`
`Then, in the second floor hallway, we split up.`
` Doctor Nanjo went to his own room.`
` Erika went to her room.`
` And I...returned to the cousins' room.`
` I couldn't hear any sounds of playing coming from the cousins' room.`
`......Could they have fallen asleep already? `
`No surprise, at this time of night.`
` If they were still playing, they would have been staying up way too late...`
` When I opened the door quietly, `
`as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight.`
` Everyone was already sleeping in their beds.`
` I'm sure they all had a great time and played a ton.`
`......Then they'd probably talked about youthful things and enjoyed staying up late.`
`......If only I hadn't found the gold, I could have enjoyed my time with them...`
` I'm already...`
` tired...`
`...so tired.`
` Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth, `
`I crawled into bed, `
`.........and immediately started to fall into the marshes of sleep.........`
` Aaah, ......today's been so insane......`
` I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now......`
`......How does he not get tired............? `
`Come to think of it......,`
` ......what was it that old bastard said when we parted company......?`
`'Tomorrow, there's something important I want to talk about, as a family.`
` It's about you.'`
`......I'm sure it's more stuff about being the successor to the head.`
`...I don't even want to hear about it......`
`'If I tell you about this, `
`......I'll probably be killed.'`
`I'll kill you whenever you want, you old bastard......`
` And then, ......what was it he said next......?`
`'It's about your birth'`
`My...`
`......birth......?`
`......Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage......`
` Not interested......`
`.........Just let me`
`......sleep.........`
