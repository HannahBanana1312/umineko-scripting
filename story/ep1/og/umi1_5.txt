`We crossed the hall again on our way to the entrance.`
` As we did, we once again saw that witch's portrait.`
` However, the word 'saw' is probably not the best word to describe that experience.`
`......It was more like our eyes were drawn to it.`
` That woman's eyes, with their sage-like glamor, definitely had the power to make those who viewed it stand rooted to the spot.`
`"............So this is the witch, Beatrice.`
` ......Is it true?"`
`"Uu-?`
` Battler doesn't believe...?"`
`Back when he had asked what this picture was, the first person to tell him it was Beatrice had been Maria.`
` Therefore, when Battler showed signs of doubt, Maria must have felt that Battler didn't have faith in her.`
`...Of course, that's not what Battler meant.`
` Maria ran up to the portrait and began banging on a plate hanging below it.`
` Maybe the title of the portrait was written there.`
` Maria, trying to prove that she wasn't lying, obstinately continued to hit the plate.`
`"Ah-, sorry about that, `
`it's not like I doubt anything you said, Maria."`
`"Uu-!`
` Battler believe it!`
` Uu-!"`
`When he patted Maria's head and apologized, she seemed to accept it, sticking out her chest and proudly uu-uu-ing.`
`".........What's this?`
` 'My most beloved witch Beatrice'.`
` .........My beloved hometown, `
`......what's with this weird, long epitaph?"`
`The plate did have the title of the portrait written on it, but it was much too big to contain only that.`
` Beneath the title, what looked like an long epitaph was also written.`
` If you just skimmed over it, several unnerving words would jump out at you.`
`"Incredible, isn't it?`
` Grandfather had that written.`
` ...Pretty deep, huh?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria knows!`
` The place where the gold is hidden!"`
`"......Wait, is it that story about the Ushiromiya family's hidden gold?`
` There's another thing that I remember from long ago...`
`...Wait, Aniki, ...is that for real?"`
`"Grandfather had this written, but he never said anything about this picture or the epitaph.`
` ......Even so, amongst the family, it is often whispered that it points to the location of Grandfather's hidden gold,`
` and that he will relinquish the inheritance and the gold to the person who solves the riddle."`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria heard that too, Maria heard that too!`
` Lots and lots of gold!"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` Something like 10 tons of gold bars.`
` I think it's a fake, though."`
`"Still, if you read this all the way through, it almost seems real."`
`......I think I already explained Grandfather's upbringing, `
`but let me also mention the Ushiromiya family's 'Legend of the Gold'.`
` Grandfather succeeded the Ushiromiya family after it had been destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake `
`and, by successfully riding the stormy seas after the war, managed to accumulate great wealth.`
`...That much of the story everyone knows.`
` However, from here on, the strange part of the story begins.`
`...Part of it is closely tied to Grandfather's black magic hobby, so its credibility is extremely low, but......`
`......Well, wait until the end before you doubt or make fun of it.`
` After the war, Grandfather correctly predicted what the future would hold and won in a huge gamble, accumulating a vast store of wealth,`
` ......but there is a mysterious legend about how he gained the funds in the first place.`
` Grandfather came from the branch family and had no connections in the business world or the financial world. `
`Even though he later built connections with the occupying forces, in the beginning he was supposedly a nameless person who had not yet gained anyone's trust.`
` Money can only be gathered based on trust.`
` There's no way anyone would lend money to an untrustworthy person.`
`......How did Grandfather, whose trustworthiness was zero, manage to obtain the large amount of funds in the first place? `
`It is said that, when asked that question, Grandfather answered like this...`
`'On a certain day, I encountered the Golden Witch Beatrice.'`
`Grandfather then went on and on about how he continued to research alchemy and techniques for summoning demons in order to become a great magician.`
`...And the entity summoned as the result of the demon-calling ceremony was the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
` He then said that he made a contract where, in exchange for his own soul, he would receive fortune and honor.`
` The witch then granted Grandfather 10 tons of gold.`
` Grandfather used this gold as collateral to prepare a vast quantity of funds,`
` and then used that to multiply his wealth by several times and revive the Ushiromiya family...`
` It seems that this story was so old that our parents had already been told it when they were still children.`
` Therefore, while our parents were still young,`
` they explored this island in various ways, believing that the gold that Grandfather had received from the witch might be hidden somewhere.`
` However, since there was the danger of them getting lost in the abandoned forest,`
` Grandmother began to spread the story that the witch lived in the forest and that approaching it was forbidden.`
`"...I remember that old story.`
` When we were little, our parents told us about it and we went all over the island searching for treasure.`
` ......Didn't we get lost in the forest and start crying until some of the servants found us? Our parents were so mad at us.`
` ...How nostalgic."`
`"We sure were idiots, weren't we?`
` After all, Grandfather used that to build up the funds that he finally bought this island with, right?`
` That means he must have had the gold before coming to this island.`
` There's no reason the gold itself should be on the island."`
`"That's not necessarily so.`
` Maybe the gold was hidden on the island from the beginning and he bought the whole island just to make sure it was all his.`
` There was a whole 10 tons of it, right?`
` It seems more realistic that he would try to secure the place where it was hidden rather than try to move it all."`
`"This epitaph was written two years ago.`
` And since Grandfather wrote it himself...`
`......I see, this does make the Legend of the Gold more believable.`
` The funds that revived the Ushiromiya family which he calls the witch's gold weighed 10 tons.`
` ......And that's sleeping somewhere, ready to be turned over to whoever can solve Grandfather's riddle. Maybe that's why he did it?`
` ......Haa, I guess that sounds like Grandfather's style or something......`
` Ihihi!`
` If it's true, that's pretty incredible."`
`The epitaph carved into the plate was very mysterious, with something like a poem or a song written on it.`
` That paragraph was incredibly disturbing, filled with the signs of Grandfather's black magic hobby, and its contents were in bad taste,`
` but it could definitely be viewed as a puzzle which, if solved, could lead to the place where the gold was hidden.`
`"Whether that's what he intended or not, I can't even imagine what his true motive was.`
` ......All I can say is, this shady epitaph was displayed here so that everyone in the family could see it.`
` By doing so, he could hint at the existence of the gold while still avoiding telling where the hiding place is.`
` ......That caused our parents' imagination to run wild and call it equal to Grandfather's level of genius..."`
`"...Sounds just like my dad, so greedy that he takes something like this so seriously.`
` Even though he laughs at Grandfather's black magic hobby, he'll still believe this story about the hidden gold.`
` It just sounds so good."`
`"......Well, it's certainly not a realistic story.`
` At that time, when Grandfather was still nameless without any connections, there was no way anyone would just lend him a massive quantity of gold bars for free.`
` ......Because of that, it's not unthinkable that Grandfather would call his sponsor a witch."`
`"Yeah, but, it's 10 tons. 10 tons!`
` If you traded that for money, how much would that come to?`
` Anyway, it'd have to be a ridiculous amount, right?!"`
`"......It would be a ridiculous amount.`
` They say that the total amount of gold mined by humankind since the dawn of history isã€€at most 100,000 tons.`
` That 1/10,000 of all of the gold humankind has obtained throughout history should belong to just one person is just insane.`
` ...And that all of that was collected in one place and that there was a witch who could just 'poof' lend it to Grandfather.`
` That would be no ordinary person."`
`"As for me, I think that that number '10 tons' sounds totally fake.`
` In the first place, has anyone other than Grandfather ever even seen it?`
` And even if some generous witch lent him some actual gold, couldn't that 10 be right but actually be mistaken from 10 kilograms?`
` Even 10 kilograms would be a pretty incredible sum, right?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...10 kilograms of gold is how much?"`
`Maria, who wasn't following the story and felt like she was being spoken to in riddles, finally found a place where she could ask us a question.`
` A question which I also wanted to know right then.`
` Whether I hear 10 kilograms or 10 tons, I know that it's an incredible amount, but I couldn't guess exactly how incredible each one is.`
` George-aniki folded his arms and tried to remember the market price of gold.`
`"......Well.`
` Gold is also affected by speculation. Its price can also change depending on its purity and the trustworthiness of the foundry.`
` You would also need to pay a commission to turn it into money.`
` Still, it is definitely a precious metal, and some people estimate that if gold mining continues at its current rate, within half of a century, humankind will have mined all of it.`
`............Just guessing haphazardly, `
`......For one kilogram, I think maybe a price of 2 million yen."`
`"WHAAaa...`
`......I know I just randomly said that 10 kilograms would be a humble amount...`
`...but even that would be worth 20 million yen, wouldn't it!?"`
`"Uu-?`
` Maria weighs 28 kilograms."`
`".........Which means that if we had Maria-chan's weight in gold,`
` we could estimate its worth at over 50 million yen."`
`"That's just unbelievable...`
` How much would 10 tons be then?`
` 10 kilograms is 20,000,000 times 1000, so......umm.`
`.........That's it!`
` 20 billion yen?!`
` What the hell!"`
`How much is 20 billion yen actually worth? `
`......We can only measure it relative to our own pocketbooks.`
` Anyway, let's say that wages over a lifetime are about 200 million yen.`
`...You grow up and work like crazy, sacrificing your life for your company, and as you approach old age are finally freed.`
` Everything including retirement money could be about 200 million yen.`
`...In other words, that is the amount of money for a human's life.`
` You could even call it the price of a life.`
`...So 100 times this sum is an unbelievable amount of money.`
`......If you work from age 20 to age 60, that's 40 years of work, `
`......so it's equal to 4000 years of work wages.`
` It's like you worked every day starting from the Jomon period and finally accumulated this much money.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Is 20 billion yen huge...?"`
`"Yeah, it's huge.`
` Maria, you could buy more of that shortcake you love than you could eat in a lifetime."`
`"......However, while that might be possible with 20 billion yen in cash, `
`I don't think it would be very realistic to have that much in gold bars all in one place.`
` Just as I said, gold is extremely heavy, and it is not very convenient for purchasing assets.`
` With highly valued stocks and bonds or really expensive precious gems, it wouldn't be unthinkable though.`
` ...You often hear of people who, in the period of confusion during the war, often traded their wealth for precious gems so that they could carry it around with them.`
` ......But you don't usually hear stories of people exchanging their wealth for gold."`
`"Of course it's heavy, but internationally it's the most trusted and stable. Doesn't that mean something?`
` With bonds, for example, if the country is destroyed they're just scraps of paper."`
`"You can also look at it that way.`
`...but even one 10 kilogram ingot is pretty heavy to carry around.`
` Haven't you heard?`
` A 50 kilogram person can't carry a 50 kilogram bag over their shoulder.`
` With that many gold bars, the amount of labor and risk for one person would be hard to calculate."`
`"So what you're saying is, while a stack of banknotes worth 20 billion yen would be annoying, `
`20 billion yen in gold would be such a big mountain that practically it would be kinda pointless."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Although the Legend of the Gold does have a pretty interesting ring to it, just the part about the 10 tons of gold makes it pretty much impossible..."`
`"If you think about it logically like that, it sounds obviously fake.`
` Haha, kind of brings you back down to reality."`
`"Anyway, that's Grandfather for you.`
` Spreading exaggerated rumors about financing from some kind rich person by calling it 10 tons of gold received from a witch, probably figuratively.`
` Even the number '10 tons' feels pretty symbolic."`
`"You mean like his gratitude for the money he borrowed was worth 10 tons of gold, or something?"`
`"Hehehe, maybe some rich man's leisured wife generously granted it to Grandfather.`
` And maybe then he started calling this person a witch?"`
`I see. Jessica's example isn't bad.`
`...Someone who would generously lend a huge sum of money to Grandfather when his trustworthiness was still zero `
`could be called a witch.`
`......Furthermore, Grandfather later used that money to build a vast amount of wealth.`
`...Someone with such a great ability to judge people `
`might also fittingly be called a witch.`
` Also, since she went to the trouble of lending all that money, `
`she might also have enthusiastically guided how it was spent.`
` The decision to unexpectedly get involved with the occupying forces and profit from the Korean War demands might have been inspired in Grandfather by the witch.`
` If you put those together, saying that he received wealth and honor from the witch might actually make sense.`
`"I see.`
` .........So, in other words, this witch granted the funds necessary to revive the Ushiromiya family and Grandfather owed her big time.`
` ...If that's the case, Grandfather, with his feelings of gratitude, had that huge painting drawn and displayed... I get it. It's not that strange a story."`
`"What if this person looked like an old witch-like granny?`
` If that's true, I can definitely understand why Grandfather tried to pretty her up when he had the painting drawn.`
` Hahahahaha, I'll bet if we ever did meet this person, she wouldn't be nearly this pretty!"`
`"Hahahaha, that's possible.`
` The name Beatrice sounds pretty western, and if you think about how everyone in our family has western-style names, `
`maybe even the name Beatrice is the result of Grandfather trying to rearrange some Japanese person's name to make it sound western."`
`"I get it, I get it.`
` That means that this pretty girl doesn't exist outside the picture.`
` Guess that means I won't be able to rub those elegant breasts~, ihihi!`
` In the first place, isn't a witch a little weird?`
` Like you could find something like that anywhere on earth."`
`As I made fun of the witch, laughing, I was trying to separate myself from the kid I was six years ago who was afraid of the witch of the forest. At that time, Maria tugged on my sleeve.`
`...The strength with which she did was filled with a little unhappiness.`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Maria?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Uu-!!`
` Beatrice e-xi-sts!"`
`Maria stared up at me.`
` She had on her usual sour look, but I could tell she was angry because of the color of her eyes.`
`"Witches exist!`
` Witches exist!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Well sure, they do exist...if you turn the TV on and watch anime or something."`
`"Exi-st!!`
` Witches exi-st!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`I started getting impatient, not knowing why Maria was jumping on me like this.`
` Then, Jessica tapped me on the shoulder and told me in a small voice.`
`"Dumbass, you're smashing a kid's dream.`
` Maria really believes that things like witches and Beatrice exist."`
`"Come to think of it, Maria-chan, in social studies at your school, when you were asked to write what you wanted to be when you grew up, you wrote 'a witch', didn't you?"`
`Maria nodded seriously.`
` Tears started to run from the corners of her eyes.`
`.........I see. To a girl who wants to become a witch in the future, `
`the existence of Beatrice was proof that witches do exist in this world, `
`and was therefore an image that she yearned after and admired.`
`"Exi-st!`
` Exi-st!`
` Witches exi-st!!`
` But Battler still doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"It's alright. They exist, witches.`
` Onii-chan believes it."`
`George-aniki kneeled down and held Maria's head.`
`...Watching this, Jessica poked my side.`
`...So that's what it is.`
` It's like, on Christmas Eve, shouting that Santa Claus couldn't exist `
`in front of a child who believes in him.`
`...I'm not the kind of guy who likes to shatter kids' dreams.`
`"......Oh, I'm sorry.`
` I wasn't trying to make fun of your dreams. I apologize.`
` Beatrice does exist.`
` Even now she's living in the forest, and comes every night to the mansion to peek in and see what everyone's doing.`
` ......So you shouldn't go into the forest.`
` At night, you mustn't stare into the dark forest.`
` You might be seen by the witch of the forest, Beatrice.`
` .........After all, Grandmother said so."`
`"Uu-......`
` Really?`
` Battler really believes?"`
`"Yep. I believe.`
` Sorry for doubting it.`
` ...C'mon, let's make up."`
`I stuck out my hand and Maria grabbed it with her tiny hand, and we made up.`
` Maria didn't grumble any more than that, so George-aniki and Jessica were relieved.`
`"...Oh.`
` So this is where all of you were.`
` I was sure you had just left to go to the beach."`
`Shannon-chan, carrying a basket, was surprised to find us all gathered in front of the portrait.`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` Well, this is the first time Battler has seen Beatrice's portrait.`
` He was just fascinated by it."`
`"That's right, it is fascinating.`
` ...Beatrice-sama is truly beautiful.`
` I am sure that she captivated the Master."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` In addition to the patron theory, there's also a theory that she was Grandfather's first love.`
` ...Either way, although it's been several decades since he met her, even now she holds a special place in his heart.`
` ...Which must mean that he is still captivated by her."`
`"Sheesh.`
` That must have made Grandmother pretty jealous, right?"`
`"I'm not really sure, but that might actually be true.`
` Apparently Grandmother believed that he was cheating on her with some blonde-haired person."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Good smell!`
` Good smell coming from Shannon!"`
`Maria, sniffing, approached the basket Shannon-chan was holding with interest.`
` After hearing that, I noticed a fragrant scent with the essence of vanilla.`
`"Ah, I apologize.`
` I was told by Kumasawa-san to bring them to everyone."`
`"What is it, I wonder?`
` ......Ooh, excellent!`
` Cookies."`
`"Uu-!`
` Want to eat cookies!`
` Want to eat cookies!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Please, eat as much as you would like.`
` ...But, umm..."`
`After all, it's not like you can just serve cookies in a place like this, in front of the portrait.`
` Shannon-chan sent us a glance which seemed to ask what we wanted to do about it.`
`...Well, normally that would be considered impolite.`
`"Maria, why don't we eat someplace other than here?`
` Let's put the cookies in a bento and have a picnic."`
`"Uu-!`
` Have a picnic, have a picnic!!`
` If we can eat cookies, let's go!"`
`"That's right, let's go get some fresh air.`
` We shouldn't grab food right in front of the witch."`
`"That's right, didn't we say that we wanted to go down to the beach in the first place?`
` Let's go, let's go."`
`"Shannon-chan.`
` Sorry, but could I ask you to get us a blanket to sit on and some flasks of tea."`
`"Right...!`
` Certainly."`
`Shannon-chan received her instructions and gracefully bowed before retracing her steps.`
` We headed for the beach on our own.`
` Everyone headed for the entrance in a group.`
`...Feeling as though that witch was staring down at our backs, I turned around once more.`
`"...Uu-.`
` ...Battler, you still don't believe...?"`
`"Nope, I believe.`
` ...That way is more imaginative!`
` The Golden Witch Beatrice gave Grandfather 10 tons of gold!`
` And that gold might be sleeping around somewhere.`
` And besides, didn't Grandfather write that strange epitaph as though challenging us to find it if we can?`
` I think that kind of romantic story is way better."`
`"20 billion yen worth of go-ld!`
` Hehe, even if we split it up between the four of us, that's still a ridiculous amount of money!"`
`"5 billion yen for each of us...`
`...Incredible!`
` With that kind of money, any business would prosper.`
` No wait, we could live our whole lives fabulously without working at all."`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Not 5 billion yen, cookie, cookie!!"`
`"Wahahaha, Maria would take cookies over money.`
` Still, 5 billion yen, that's like a dream!"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` ......Is it possible that you all truly believe in Father's Legend of the Gold?"`
`".........The story about a witch who gave him the gold and so forth, we obviously don't believe.`
` However, there's no mistake about the gold."`
`"The fact that Father obtained gold bars from an unknown source can be confirmed in several ways.`
` We heard that, before the president of the Marusoo company died, Father showed him a large amount of gold somewhere.`
` Father used that claim to prove that that there were 10 tons worth."`
`"That's just the nonsense of a senile old man.`
` Along with Father, he was just fabricating a story.`
` You can't take it seriously."`
`"If that gold didn't exist, he wouldn't have been able to gather so much funding...!`
` Before the president died, he was a person with such a sincere personality that he gathered the respect from many in the business world.`
` He couldn't have become a partner in such a fraud...!"`
`"Aniki,`
` the president of Marusoo definitely saw it.`
` 10 tons of it, clearly with his own eyes.`
` Even more, Father let the president take one ingot at random and have it examined.`
` The results of the examination showed that the 10 kilogram ingot was 99.99 percent pure.`
` He said that the Ushiromiya family crest, the One-winged Eagle, was carved into it."`
`"Almost instantly, the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold spread amongst the fixers of the business world.`
` Gold from an unknown foundry has a poor rate of conversion into money.`
` Thinking that it was a chance for decisive profits, they accepted it as collateral, and as a result Father was able to receive a giant loan..."`
`"Isn't there a limit to how ridiculous you can get?`
` ...How old are you people?`
` Are you still taking that nursery tale you heard as a kid seriously?`
` Where is the proof that this 10 tons worth of gold even exists?`
` Isn't it just the lies of Father and those who were closest to him?"`
`"......Of course it's just a story.`
` But still, Aniki.`
` The amount of money that Father raised required a suitable quantity of collateral.`
` Even if the gold was just a rumor, that he must have shown them a treasure of comparable worth is an unmistakable truth."`
`"It was just an illusion of money created by our penniless father.`
` He made it seem that non-existent gold actually existed and fooled his sponsors.`
` It was probably the gamble of a lifetime.`
` ...Fortunately, his use of those funds proved successful.`
` If the Korean war demands hadn't come and the Ushiromiya family had not been restored, Father would probably have been hounded after as the crook of the century."`
`"In that case, are you saying that the gold never existed, and that Father made it all up?"`
`"Of course.`
` Therefore, after he was sufficiently successful, the illusion of gold became inconvenient.`
` So Father made up that absurd story about the witch and black magic and made the whole thing seem less believable.`
` In other words, he revealed that the illusion of gold was fabricated.`
` If he says that he received the gold from a witch, no one would believe that it exists at all, right? `
`He possibly said it for all of your sakes.`
` Nevertheless, some stupid offspring wanting to divide up this non-existent gold with the rest of the inheritance have appeared.`
` ......Rosa, don't tell me that even you believe this kind of a fabrication...?"`
`"...............I can't prove whether or not Father really has the gold.`
` However, as one of father's four children, I just want to claim my rightful share."`
`"Ho...`
` It looks like even Rosa's started to say it.`
` Alright, maybe this is what you all want to say:`
` that I am trying to keep all of the gold to myself..."`
`"Nii-san, the fact is that you've obtained a massive amount of funding.`
` If we rule out the possibility that you have been embezzling Father's personal funds, `
`then there's only one possibility left, right?"`
`"Aniki, maybe you have already found the 10 tons of gold bars.`
` It sure looks that way to us."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Something like that never existed in the first place."`
`"Then explain yourself.`
` Embezzlement of Father's assets or Father's hidden gold.`
` How could you have gathered so much funding if you didn't use one of these?"`
`"I also have many friends in the political world and the financial world.`
` I have done nothing more than gain their assistance.`
` ......And as to that, I have no responsibility to explain it to you.`
` You understand, don't you?`
` There are some topics that can't be talked about."`
`"......If you insist on it, that's alright.`
` But Aniki, Father doesn't have long.`
` Nobody can ensure that he will live to see this day next year.`
` When Father dies, the inheritance will be passed on.`
` We will all set up impartial lawyers and accountants to inspect Father's financial and political status."`
`"If, at that time, the fact that our brother has unjustly interfered with Father's money comes to light...`
`......you understand, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` You're starting to make me feel as indignant as my wife was."`
`"...Father's gold is definitely one of Father's assets!`
` I understand that it's money that you can't reveal openly,`
` but the four siblings should have an equal right to it."`
`"In short, even though you are our brother, we will have your financial situation investigated `
`to determine whether or not you are hoarding the gold."`
`"Isn't this a good opportunity.`
` Prove the existence of this backup from friends and acquaintances that you mentioned.`
` That way we can sportingly apologize for foolishly doubting you.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Krauss nii-san, you are the one who's avoiding the topic.`
` If you were guiltless, you could just prove that you were in the right. Yet you aren't even trying to respond."`
`"However, Aniki, we still have to consider your position here.`
` As Father's representative, you're probably bearing a larger share of the burden than we are.`
` It wouldn't be fair for the rest of us, who have been living terribly relaxed lives until now, were to complain without taking that into account."`
`".........Ho.`
` Until just now I've been busy being spoken ill of and being flattered.`
` Please get to the point."`
`"In short, ......randomly investigating nit-picky aspects of Father's wealth seems a fairly inefficient way to do it.`
` As you said, Krauss nii-san, there may also be movements of money that are difficult to explain.`
` Upon understanding that, we have come to consult with you.`
` ...A mutually beneficial consultation."`
`"Consultation?`
` Ho."`
`"......When the inheritance is distributed, you will be rewarded for your years of hard work taking care of Dad by an agreement that is generous in your favor."`
`"Don't misunderstand us, Nii-san.`
` It's not like we are saying that we will abandon our rights.`
` It's just that when we claim what we deserve,`
` it wouldn't be bad if we allow a generous understanding from your position. That's what we mean."`
`"In other words, if you'll accept our conditions,`
` at the time of the division of the inheritance, we won't mind leaving the investigation of Father's financial status to you, Krauss nii-san."`
`All of the siblings from Eva downward suspected that Krauss was trying to steal their father's wealth.`
` In that situation, letting Krauss report on the state of their father's wealth by himself was extremely contradictory and a huge concession.`
` If, as they claimed, Krauss was actually embezzling money, Krauss would be able to hide that fact.`
` Besides that, it would also be possible for him to control the distribution of the inheritance in a manner favorable to himself.`
` Krauss, also realizing that this sounded to good to be true, couldn't help but feel doubt...`
` He had to worry about what kind of collateral they had to make this kind of a compromise...`
`"...Hoh.`
` After mistrusting me completely, you now say that you're willing to restore your confidence in me as the eldest sibling?`
` And what are you asking for?"`
`"Just what we deserve as siblings.`
` ......You aren't the kind of person who would steal Father's property.`
` However, there is no patron financing you.`
` ...Considering all that, there is a certain explanation that would satisfy the rest of us."`
`"......Nii-san, you found 10 tons of gold `
`and used that as collateral to gather some funding.`
` ...Yes, just like Father did in the past, right?"`
`"If that's the case, there won't be any funny bits in Father's finances.`
` You've always been a good son, lookin' after Father.`
` Why would we mistrust a person like that?"`
`".........You're being so roundabout I can barely understand you.`
` Say it more clearly and practically."`
`"Our first condition:`
` Aniki, you must admit that you have found Father's gold."`
`"...Are you asking me to admit that I possess gold that does not exist?"`
`"Our second condition:`
` Regarding the gold, take each sibling's portion and pay it to us."`
`"How foolish.`
` With the non-existant 20 billion yen of gold, that would be 5 billion yen per person. Are you telling me to pay a total of 15 billion yen?`
` ......Ridiculous!"`
`"Keep listening until the end!`
` We know that much money can't just appear out of nowhere.`
` We're not asking you to make an impossible deal!`
` Of course, regardin' the portions of the gold, we plan to reward you sufficiently for your hard work until now in our calculations."`
`"Our third condition:`
` The portion of the gold to the one bearing the title of successor to the Ushiromiya main family will be 50%. The remainder will be split fairly between the siblings.`
` Of course, this also includes you, Krauss nii-san."`
`"Of the 20 billion, 12.5 billion will go to Aniki,`
` 2.5 billion will go to Eva nee-san,`
` 2.5 billion will go to me,`
` and 2.5 will go to Rosa."`
`".........That portion makes me so grateful I could cry.`
` So you're saying, for the sake of the gold that doesn't exist, I must pay you 7.5 billion."`
`"What's wrong?`
` Nii-san, your share is five times the size of ours.`
` That's such a good condition, I'd be jumping for joy.`
` Uhuhuhuhuhu..."`
`"Our fourth condition:`
` The divided gold will be included when the inheritance is distributed at the time of Father's death.`
` However, as a deposit, 10% of our portions will be paid to us promptly.`
` The payment must be made before March of next year."`
`"......What do you think, Krauss nii-san? This is an ideal chance for you to restore the trust you need to run Father's assets, isn't it?!`
` Of course, it might be impossible to get a whole 7.5 billion before Father dies.`
` However, you can't say that you couldn't manage a deposit of 750 million, right?"`
`"Paying 700 million in half a year might be slightly bothersome, `
`but Aniki, who has many friends in the political and business spheres, should be able to manage it."`
`"Normally, I'd hope to receive the 7.5 billion right now, all at once.`
` But out of concern for you, I'll show my sincerity by asking for only ten percent of that for the time being.`
` It's alright to let the remaining 90 percent carry over until the distribution of the inheritance.`
` ...Right?`
` With ten percent to show sincerity, even you would notice it."`
`"............So my right to investigate the status of Father's assets is being sold to me for 750 million.`
` .........Heh, heheheh.`
` Isn't that great?`
` You all sure have grown.`
` I never thought you all would become capable of offering a deal to me."`
`"Nii-san, If you accept these, the rest of us siblings will leave the investigation of Father's assets to you.`
` However, the results of that invesigation will be subject to protest.`
`...It's only natural, right?`
` We'd be sad if you adjusted our portion of 7.5 billion downwards."`
`"As a general rule, we wouldn't complain.`
` As long as you do it neatly, it's fine.`
` ...As long as you don't do anything significantly obvious, we don't plan to aggravate anything.`
` We just want the inheritance quickly.`
` We don't want it to get all drawn out and led astray."`
`"......In the case of a complaint, who would do the second investigation?"`
`"............It's alright if it is you.`
` This will probably be the first and last opportunity for the siblings to discuss this.`
` ...I believe that it won't come to that."`
`"Heheh, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Rosa really can talk sometimes."`
`That Krauss was completely not trusted as the oldest sibling is so obvious at this point that there's no need to explain it.`
` The formerly tyrannical oldest brother would always abuse his privileges and violate the other siblings' shares.`
`...Compared to that, the other three, who had become adults, were only now striking back at him for the first time, and only by working together...`
`"I'm sorry, but there are further conditions.`
` Our fifth condition:`
` This decision must take precedence over Father's will.`
` .........Later on, we don't want some will to appear and make this decision completely useless."`
`".........I see that you're very cautious.`
` ...Then let me ask, if the gold really were found, what would you do?"`
`"As long as you settle this matter with the corresponding payment, `
`the rest of us`
` 'really'`
` don't care whether the gold appears or not.`
` ...You can think of our share as an advance payment."`
`"*giggle*, it's alright to dream.`
` You plan to turn this island into a resort, right?`
` During construction, you might stumble upon the gold by chance."`
`Eva let out a high-pitched laugh.`
` Krauss watched without even flinching.`
`"......Let me add a 7th condition before I accept.`
` In the situation that any sibling other than myself finds the gold, they will immediately turn it over to me."`
`"Yes, yes. Of course, we'll hold onto it for you.`
` *giggle*!"`
`It was a play on words.`
` The others, who were forcing Krauss to pay money for some nonexistent gold, `
`would of course not ensure Krauss's portion if they actually found the gold.`
` From the beginning, this deal had been nothing more than a threat directed at Krauss.`
` While the truth might be different, the possibility that Krauss was embezzling his father's assets was extremely high.`
` When at last Kinzo faced death and the inheritance would be distributed, surely some unpleasant facts would be established.`
` That situation would likely be a fatal wound to Krauss.`
` They had snatched up that weak point and, under the veil of compromise, were threatening their brother to try and wring out a huge sum of money.`
`......However, they had let one thing slip.`
` The three of them had forgotten that their oldest sibling, who they couldn't defeat unless they banded together, was very crafty and had a swiftly spinning brain.`
` Krauss, noticing that Eva, sure of her victory, could not hide her smile, relaxedly let out a gloating laugh as he spoke.`
`"Hahaha.`
` Isn't that a great story?`
` ...I also have felt a deep pain in my heart at my estrangement from the rest of you.`
` If by accepting these conditions, the relationship between the siblings could once again become friendly, I would be quite pleased.`
` I'll join in on this with pleasure.`
` ......Be happy, Rosa.`
` The deal is concluded."`
`".................."`
`Rosa's expression dimmed.`
`......When her brother started talking like this, the conversation would never change for the better.`
`...Eva was also sensitive enough to realize this.`
` Therefore, even though Krauss had obediently accepted the deal, she was unable to wipe away her feeling of insecurity.`
`"...My, how obedient.`
` That's not like you, Nii-san."`
`"That's harsh.`
` You think I have an ulterior motive?`
` Of course there isn't one.`
` Just the same as all of you."`
`'Just the same as all of you'.`
` It felt as though only that part was emphasized.`
` The color of Rudolf's face darkened.`
` He heard it as `
`'I have an idea at the same level as yours'.`
` That gave him a sense of urgency.`
` Trying to bring this near-finished discussion to a conclusion, he rushed to wrap it up.`
`"......Then we are good.`
` ...So, Aniki.`
` Would you mind signing here?`
` This is a written contract containing the discussion we have been having.`
` There's one for each person.`
` Everyone will sign for the same contents."`
`Rudolf took four written contracts out of his breast pocket that had the details of their deal written on them.`
`"The seventh condition that Krauss nii-san proposed will, of course, be added from now on.`
` Don't worry."`
`"Aniki, will you use a pen?"`
`Rudolf took a fountain pen out of his breast pocket and offered it to Krauss.`
` Krauss made as if to accept it, but then, with a small laugh, drew back his hand without taking it and spoke.`
`"............Actually,`
` in order to make sure this agreement is definitely effective, I would like to propose a single amendment."`
`When Krauss said that one sentence...`
`...All of the siblings felt as though something annoying was creeping up their backs at the same time.`
`"...Tha-, that won't do.`
` We've already decided, haven't we?`
` Quietly sign it."`
`"Eva, why are you so impatient.`
` Of course I will sign.`
` I'll promise that your share of the gold will be 7.5 billion yen.`
` I also promise that, when Father's inheritance is distributed, I will cleanly and neatly liquidate it.`
` .........However, in one part, there is a point that I cannot compromise on no matter what."`
`".........What are you talking about.`
` What point don't you like...?"`
`"The part about promptly paying ten percent of each portion, 750 million yen.`
` As you pointed out, my political and financial status is not prosperous.`
` While I can ensure that I will definitely collect on various future investments,`
` at this time I have no choice but to admit that I am very poor.`
` In short, I have absolutely no money that I can move around right now.`
` I am incompetent, and my business skills and senses are dull.`
` Since I am as weak as you all have said, I have no power to move 750 million in just half of a year."`
`"Tha-, that can't be true.`
` Are you trying to deceive us with such a careless trick?"`
`"At the time of the division of the inheritance, I will liquidate everything at once.`
` Remove the condition that I must pay you ten percent in advance.`
` ...That is the only situation I am willing to sign under."`
`"......Krauss nii-san, that ten percent is nothin' more than a number to measure your sincerity, isn't it?`
` There shouldn't really be any room for argument on this deal.`
` We're doin' you a favor by offerin' to let things slide for just ten percent in good faith money.`
` Now that you understand that, rejectin' our offer would seriously damage our trusting relationship, yes...?"`
`Hideyoshi had a humble expression on his face and was rubbing his hands together,`
` but his eyes were not calm at all.`
`......Krauss had already seen through the shadow in the depths of those eyes.`
`".........Hmph.`
` Why are you all so hurried?`
` Or are you possibly afraid of something?`
` .........Rosa, won't you tell at least me?`
` ...Secretly, without telling the rest of the siblings."`
`"............It, it's not like I......"`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` All we're asking is whether you're going to sign or not.`
` Just forget about making any strange deals or anything suspicious."`
`"......Hoh?`
` So I have no margin for negotiation.`
` ...Do you claim that my position is so weak that we are not in an even relationship...?"`
`Shivers began to crawl up Rudolf's back...`
` He began to feel himself getting sucked in by the height of his brother's completely insurmountable wall `
`and that long shadow which had existed since they were children...`
`"Shouldn't this deal be made on an even footing?`
` To me, this deal will restore the long lost trust of my younger brother and sisters and deepen the love between us siblings.`
` And there has been an uneasiness in my heart to have this resolved quickly.`
` I would be very happy if it could be resolved today.`
` .........But you too would be very happy if this deal were quickly resolved, wouldn't you...?"`
`Krauss stared at each of the siblings.`
`...They avoided his gaze with animal-like instinct.`
` Only Hideyoshi was slow avoiding it.`
` ...So he was caught in Krauss's gaze.`
`"Hideyoshi-san.`
` I hear that your company has been going extremely well recently, hasn't it?`
` With a swift rhythm it has become listed as a stock, and both its performance and stock prices have soared.`
` I am truly jealous."`
`"...M-, my husband's situation surely has nothing to do with this."`
`"However, it is unfortunate that you have neglected your stockholders.`
` It's also horrible that you were unable to solidify your base when you became stock-listed.`
` ...Before you realized it, some bad-natured colleagues of yours had bought up a huge share of your company's stock, didn't they?"`
`".........H,`
` ......how could you know something like that..."`
`"The same way as Hideyoshi-san.`
` If you can collect evidence proving that no one would offer a loan to me, then I can collect evidence on Hideyoshi-san.`
` Hahaha, is it really that strange of a thing?"`
`Krauss grinned broadly.`
`...In contrast, Hideyoshi's face was turning obviously pale......`
` Hideyoshi's company was a fast food chain management company that he had started from nothing.`
` Through Hideyoshi's management efforts, performance of the business repeatedly rose and magnified, and recently a petition to make it a stock-listed company succeeded.`
` The greatest advantage of being in the stock-holding system was that, by selling stock certificates, a large amount of financing could be gained.`
` That amount was far greater than the actual profits from the business.`
` This made it an extremely effective way to gather the massive funds needed to grow his company even further.`
` However, in exchange for financing the company, the stockholders had certain rights.`
` That was, in order to give the company that they had financed even greater profit, they had the right to observe and control it.`
`......That right was guaranteed to all stockholders, and they would sometimes use it to dismiss ineffectual management.`
` It was the 'right' to prevent the money they had spent financing the company from going to waste by watching the management of the company.`
` However, if they use this right forcibly, they can eject the former management and take over the company.`
`...Because the general body of all shareholders has the power to dismiss the management and nominate new management.`
` That power is determined based on the majority decision of the stockholders.`
` And people who hold more stock get to cast more votes.`
` In other words, if some person or group holds a majority of the stock, they can freely chase out the old management and make the president anyone they would like.`
` If they want, it is also possible for them to make themselves president.`
` In many companies, their stock gets bought up by malicious people and, in order to prevent their position from being threatened,`
` they make their own employees or people close to them buy a lot of stock certificates. To prevent hostile action from being taken by the majority, they try to take some kind of defensive measures.`
` However, since Hideyoshi's company had only recently become stock-listed, he hadn't had the time to strengthen those defensive measures.`
` No, maybe Hideyoshi himself was so engrossed in the management of his company that he couldn't realize the dangers of being stock-listed.`
` It's hard to say whether he should be viewed as a kind-hearted and skilled manager immersed in management, or a foolish manager who had his feet swept out from under him...`
`...There were people out there who would not let him get away with that naivety unscathed.`
` They began repeatedly buying up Hideyoshi's company's stock and suddenly gained such strength that they couldn't be ignored.`
` They then sent anonymous documents to the shareholders and began to capture the majority.`
` The documents read: 'The current management continues to make pointless investments and is ignoring the needs of the stockholders.`
` Let us force the current management to retire, cut the current wasted investments, and let this company be born again as one that gives more back to the stockholders.'`
`It is very difficult to make the actual state of a company's management known.`
`...The success created by Hideyoshi's tiny amount of sleep and his constant concern for his company was cruelly twisted, and he lost the trust of his stockholders.`
` Their efforts had almost collected a majority of the stock in the company.`
`...At that point, even Hideyoshi noticed and started to buy back the stock, but the stock holders, who realized that the company was undergoing an acquisition maneuver, `
`demanded a ridiculous price for the shares that Hideyoshi was trying to buy back.`
` They continually tortured Hideyoshi, who had no leeway in the negotiation of the price.`
` One of the certainties of capitalism is that value will rise when both parties vie for the same thing.`
` And one of the certainties of democracy is that the majority controls everything.`
` So in the end, whoever manages to buy up the most stock wins.`
`...So whoever has the most money wins.`
` If Hideyoshi could obtain a large sum of money at this critical time, he would be able to avoid losing all of that which he had built up...`
`{a:c: `
`THEREFORE, `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, `
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`He couldn't wait for the division of Kinzo's inheritance, which could happen at any time.`
`"And you, Rudolf, you've been in a lot of trouble lately, haven't you?`
` They say it's scary overseas, but it seems that's really true.`
` American trials are settled quite emotionally.`
` They won't give a generous judgement to a foreigner.`
` ......Weren't you advised by your lawyer that making a settlement with the other party would be more economical in the end?"`
`"............What are you talking about...?"`
`"......Well, it's some trouble from work.`
` It's no big deal.`
` It'll be settled with money..."`
`Kyrie quickly recognized what Rudolf's complicated expression meant.`
`......Her husband had gotten wrapped up in some kind of trouble without her knowledge, and had been suffering alone.`
`"That's right.`
` In this world, anything can be settled with money.`
` After all, it can even buy back the broken bonds between siblings!`
` America is very fussy about the violation of rights.`
` But with money, anything can be settled.`
` Long live capitalism.`
` ...Although it's rumored that the settlement money can reach several million dollars, isn't it?"`
`Rudolf had been building a large amount of wealth with a certain type of niche market.`
`...However, a niche is a niche.`
` It's definitely not a sunny job.`
` An American corporate giant was trying to accuse Rudolf's company of violating their rights.`
` For various reasons, it was thought that winning the trial was extremely unlikely, and Rudolf went for an all-out surrender.`
`...But even that was a path resolved with money.`
` If he could only pay that money, though it might be painful, he could still pick himself back up.`
`...But if he didn't pay, he'd lose everything.`
`{a:c: `
`THEREFORE, `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n} `
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`".........Rosa, you're a good and noble little sister.`
` You wouldn't even touch a dangerous money game.`
` ...However, your softhearted nature was your ruin, wasn't it...?`
` I wouldn't think one should agree to become a co-signer so lightly."`
`"Nn, `
`...umm, `
`...Th-, that has nothing to do with you, Krauss nii-san!!"`
`Rosa uncharacteristically lay bare her emotions and yelled.`
`...There's no way he could know.`
` As Krauss watched, he let slip a muffled laugh...`
`......Without exception.`
` Every one of them, `
`{a:c: `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n} `
`WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}`
`In other words, the situation had been reversed.`
` Because only Krauss, who they were threatening, had no urgent need for a large sum of money.`
` Compared to that, the three who were threatening him wanted money quickly, no matter what the cost.`
` So Krauss was able to control this deal however he liked.`
` Krauss was very sly.`
` He had known of their Achilles heel from the beginning.`
` Even so, he had not been certain.`
` Therefore, he had hidden that until the very end, and, upon closely and completely examining their attitude, he had struck back.`
`"If I could, I would love to raise some money for my cute brother and sisters in their time of need.`
` ...But unfortunately, I have nothing on hand.`
`......If you have any sponsors in mind that can raise a whole 750 million, I suggest you try there first."`
`Krauss's elated words were horribly blunt.`
` The other siblings could do nothing more than listen, grinding their teeth.`
`.........If they could think of a sponsor that convenient, they wouldn't have kept up this charade.`
` They had entered this huge battle specifically because they had exhausted all other options.`
`"...If you're still set on relying on your older brother, `
`you can use my influence to find a sponsor.`
` .........Oh wait, you already said that I have no influence.`
` Well then, I can't do anything, can I?`
` ......Hehheheheheheheh!"`
`Krauss's low, gloating laugh began to fill the parlor.`
` The younger siblings who had, until now, been driving the oldest brother into a corner, could do nothing more than grimace and grind their teeth...`
`"............E, Eva......"`
`"......Don't make me laugh...`
` As if I could borrow from you...!`
` Don't make me laugh,`
` ...Don't make me laugh......!"`
`"............If,`
`......if we relied on you, how would you help us..."`
`"I told you, didn't I.`
` All I can do is find other sponsors for you.`
` Of course, I will negotiate for the largest interest rate possible.`
` Hehheheheh, gahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Damn you...,`
`taking advantage of us............"`
`".........Honey.`
` Please calm down."`
`"I am calm. I'm extremely cool......`
`............You bastard...!"`
`Kyrie grabbed her husband's hand.`
` But that action made him feel even more pitiful, so Rudolf shook it off.`
`...Krauss laughed as though seeing that made him extremely happy.`
`"In times like these, it sure would be nice to find Father's hidden gold.`
` If you did, you could split it up into 2.5 billion yen portions right now.`
` How sad, how sad. How very sad!`
` How extremely totally truly hopelessly sad!`
`............Tonight, as all the siblings drink together, `
`let us solve the riddle of Beatrice's epitaph and discover the location of Father's hidden gold.`
` If we combine four friendly siblings, there is surely no puzzle that can't be solved.`
` ...Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"............Hmph.`
` They're doing something interesting.`
` Well then, what are the conditions that they attached?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Whether or not Krauss-sama actually discovered the gold, he would pay Eva-sama, Rudolf-sama and Rosa-sama a total of 7.5 billion yen for their shares.`
` However, ten percent of that would be paid before March."`
`"Fu, hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha...`
` Krauss, you dunce.`
` That he would have his feet swept out from under him by his younger siblings...`
` Isn't that truly pleasant.`
`......But it seems their trap was naive?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Krauss-sama exposed that Eva-sama and the younger siblings all had an urgent need to get money."`
`"Hmph.`
` Can you really call something of that level exposing?`
` That incomplete, incompetent man.`
` .........What are they doing now?"`
`"......That conversation has been put on hold for the time being.`
` Now, Beatrice-sama's epitaph is being discussed."`
`"So, they are trying to solve the riddle and find out where my gold is hidden?"`
`"............Yes."`
`Kinzo set down his glasses and snorted.`
`".........Will the miracle be fulfilled first, `
`or will those fools expose the gold first?`
` ...What a sight.`
` ...If those fools solve my puzzle, at that time I will be completely defeated.`
` They can suck my corpse down to the last fragment of bone.`
` Great magic can house a miracle from the fools' greed.`
` ...And yet!!`
` If the fulfillment of the miracle comes first...`
` If it comes first!`
` Beatrice will be resurrected again!!`
` That smile which I have been chasing half my life will be restored...! `
`Oooooohhh, Beatrice!!`
` The sacred night when the miracle is wagered will come, and the devils' game will begin...!`
` I will definitely win, and will definitely remain alive!!`
` I'll give up the other people's lives!`
` I don't need wealth or honor or assets or gold or anything!`
` I only want to see your smile one more time!!`
` *Coughcoughcough*!!"`
`Kinzo choked, apparently in great pain.`
` Kanon got closer and tried to pat his master's back, but Kinzo signaled that he didn't need to.`
`"............Do you know why I went to the trouble of exposing the hidden location of the gold so that everyone could see it?"`
`"......No."`
`"It is because magical power is decided by risk.`
` If the number of people who try to discover Beatrice's gold is great,`
` and the danger of that happening is great as well, then assuming that the bet is successful despite those long odds, the magical power will bring about a grand miracle.`
`.........In other words, magic is a game.`
` It is not true that the most superior person will become the winner.`
` The winner is superior because he is granted magic.`
` Do you understand?`
` The miracle of life can be granted only after winning against the divine odds of several hundred million to one.`
` ............Is this a little difficult for you to understand?"`
`".........My apologies."`
`"That's fine.`
` It all comes down to this.`
` To the one that solves the mystery of Beatrice's epitaph, I will give all of that which I have built up.`
` Wealth, honor, gold, and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. Everything that I have established!`
` Since tackling the riddle is the only condition, it is not limited to my children.`
` For example, if you succeeded in solving it, that would make you qualified to gain everything."`
`".........Yes.`
` However,`
`......I couldn't possibly understand such a difficult riddle."`
`"Of course.`
` I made it difficult.`
` ...But you must also challenge it.`
` That will become the seed with which the miracle of my magic will be summoned.`
` If everyone challenges it, and everyone fails, that will be that.`
` However, if the miracles are gathered and the magical power is born, it will happen then!`
` Beatrice will revive.`
` Therefore you too must challenge it.`
` Everyone must challenge it.`
` And in doing so, they must give strength to my magic!!`
` Do you understand?!"`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I will try."`
`For a long while, Kinzo repeatedly muttered to himself, agitated and grabbing onto his head.`
` Kanon stayed where he was, alert and unmoving, until he was given the next order from his master.`
`...Kinzo finally realized this.`
`"Very well, leave me.`
` ......There is a bag of sweets on the liquor cabinet.`
` You can take some with you as a reward."`
`"......I'm fine.`
` After all,`
` .........I am furniture."`
`"............Hmmm.`
` ......So furniture doesn't eat sweets?`
` ...Indeed.`
` In that case, leave me."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed and left the study.`
` As the door was closed, a heavy locking noise resounded.`
` But that was not the sound of Kanon locking the door.`
` It was the door locking automatically.`
` No one could enter without Kinzo's permission, and once they left, they could not enter again.`
`......It was a mechanism that Kinzo, unable to trust his blood relatives, had created to lock himself up in his own study and isolate himself from the outside world.`
` He was already unable to trust anyone excepting, not the sons who shared his blood, but those servants who called themselves furniture...`
`"............Nanjo-sama, how are you feeling."`
`"...Ah, Genji-san.`
` Oh, it's just that there is no place for me to be anymore."`
`With a bitter laugh, Nanjo turned to face the door to the parlor.`
`...It seemed that because of that motion, Genji understood what Nanjo wanted to say.`
` For the most part, Genji also understood the family's situation.`
`...It must have made him want to frown, knowing that right now in the lounge, the master he served was being discussed so disrespectfully.`
` But it would have been very difficult to gather that from his indifferent expression.`
`".........But, `
`...I don't understand.`
` ...Why did Kinzo-san have something so provocative written, I wonder."`
`Nanjo looked at the portrait of Beatrice.`
`......No, he actually directed his gaze beneath the portrait, at the plate with the epitaph.`
`"............I don't presume to understand the Master's thoughts.`
` However, I have realized that those thoughts are very deep."`
`"Since long ago, when Kinzo-san played chess, he would always prepare his moves according to some far-reaching judgement.`
` Yes, sometimes even to make moves I couldn't understand.`
` ......For an average person like me, it was impossible to see through to whatever it was he was planning..."`
`"Sometimes I wonder whether this is not some kind of will from the Master.`
` .........Would he entrust his assets and inheritance to whoever could solve this riddle?"`
`"......Then maybe he hoped to force the four siblings to work together and solve the riddle `
`before some outsider like myself solved it.`
` It might be something like that.`
` Kinzo-san might rudely abuse his children, but he may also hope that the siblings repair their relationship."`
`"..............."`
`If, as Nanjo said, this epitaph had been written to repair the relationship between the siblings, that would be extremely pleasant.`
`...However, both Nanjo and Genji realized that at least that much was definitely impossible.`
` As those who held the longest relationship with Kinzo, even though they were more trusted than his blood relatives, `
`they could not guess at Kinzo's true motive...`
`"......The Master is always saying that it doesn't matter whether they're a member of the family as long as they have the qualification of solving the riddle.`
` ......What about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"No, no......It's a little too hard to understand for this senile old man.`
` ......Actually, I wrote this epitaph down on my notebook at one point in time.`
` Night after night, I would try to solve it before going to sleep, `
` ......but, hahaha, it really is hard.`
` It looks like there might be some free time to relax and consider it before someone comes to get us.`
` What do you say, Genji-san?"`
`".........I am nothing more than furniture that serves the Master.`
` Gold and assets are useless to me."`
`"My, my, you are a humble person.`
` ...That's probably why Kinzo-san trusts you so much."`
`"If so, I am honored..."`
`As Nanjo lightly laughed in response, he once again looked at the epitaph.`
`"......My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key..."`
`That which is written on the epitaph of the portrait of my most beloved witch Beatrice is as follows:`
`My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key.`
` If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village.`
` In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
` There sleeps the key to the Golden Land.`
` He who lays hand upon the key shall travel under the rules below.`
` At the first twilight, you shall lift up as sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
` At the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
` At the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my honorable name on high.`
` At the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
` At the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
` At the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
` At the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` At the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
` At the ninth twilight, the witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive.`
` At the tenth twilight, the journey shall end and you should reach the village of gold.`
` The witch will praise the wise, and should bestow four treasures.`
` One shall be, all the gold from the Golden Land.`
` One shall be, the resurrection of the souls of all the dead.`
` One shall be, even the resurrection of the lost love.`
` One shall be, to put the witch to sleep for all time.`
` Sleep peacefully, my most beloved witch, Beatrice.`
