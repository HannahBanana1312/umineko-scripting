`Lunch ended, and the servants removed the tableware and went to the kitchen.`
` The wind and rain neither weakened nor strengthened, and the island remained cut off from the outside world.`
` It seemed that, at first, Natsuhi had planned not to let anyone set one foot outside the room,`
` but when it came time to prepare lunch, she finally realized that this was impossible.`
` However, in order to avoid having anyone alone in the kitchen, she told the three servants to go together.`
` Because of that, the servants were the first ones given the right to leave the stuffy parlor, which had been packed with eleven people.`
`......Since breakfast had immediately followed that terrible incident, and many of them hadn't eaten much,`
` everyone tore into their lunches in silence.`
`"I will wash the dishes, so you can rest a while, Kanon-kun, Genji-san.`
` ...Do you want something to drink?"`
`".........I don't need anything.`
` Kanon?"`
`"......I don't need anything either."`
`"You two must have been so busy, and so early in the morning...`
` It's no wonder you're worn out..."`
`The only sound was that of Kumasawa washing the dishes, which resounded throughout the kitchen.`
` Genji and Kanon sat in some chairs a short distance away, their eyes lightly closed.`
` Just as Kumasawa had said, those two had probably built up a great deal of fatigue.`
` But that didn't mean they could let it show in front of the relatives.`
`...Avoiding that was one of their virtues.`
` After the silence had continued for some time,`
` .........Kanon opened his mouth and muttered.`
`"...............Shannon...`
`............Why..., did she have to die in such a horrible way...?"`
`"......Forget about how she died.`
` .........It was nothing more than...bad luck."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...It was nothing more than bad luck."`
`They both fell silent once again.`
` ...Kanon's expression was filled with grief.`
`"To think that Shannon-chan's actually dead...`
` I still can't believe it.`
` ......Poor, poor Shannon-chan...`
`......Not being able to meet her again feels like a lie...`
` I just wanted to see that girl's smiling face one more time..."`
`Kumasawa spoke with her back facing them.`
`...After all, Kumasawa hadn't seen Shannon's corpse,`
` so she had no trouble mentioning Shannon's face.`
`...When Kanon heard those words, it reminded him again of how only half of Shannon's face had been left, and his grieving expression twisted even further...`
`".........Why did Beatrice do that to Shannon...?`
` ......If she wanted a sacrifice, there were plenty of others to choose from...`
`......Why..., ......why...?!"`
`".........It was nothing more than bad luck.`
` ...If we were less lucky, one of us could have been lying out there.`
` And it could have been anyone else.`
` ......Everything is left to fate."`
`"Genji-sama.`
` .........You said that the door to Madam's room was stained with traces of something like blood, right...?`
` The same substance that was painted on the shutter?"`
`"......Hmmm.`
` ...It was the trace of something unpleasant.`
` Almost as though someone with blood-stained fingers had been trying to pull out the doorknob,`
` ...no, scratch through the door...`
`...That sort of unpleasant mark."`
`"So does this mean that...`
` Beatrice-sama came to visit Madam's room,`
` ......and tried to open the door, but`
` couldn't...?"`
`Genji thought back to the time he had seen those traces of blood on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
` With the substance sticking to the door around the doorknob, and the marks of something scratching against the door...`
` it had definitely appeared as though`
` someone had tried to open the door, but couldn't...`
`"...Why,`
` .........was Madam not chosen as a sacrifice...?`
` If only she had been chosen,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't have had to die..."`
`Just then, a loud, sharp noise came in from the hall.`
` Both of them turned around, surprised.`
`"..................It sounds like you're having a pretty interesting discussion.`
` Let me join in too."`
`Before any of the servants had realized it, Battler was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.`
`"......Battler-sama.`
` Please, excuse me..."`
`Genji-san and Kanon-kun stood up, surprised, and hastily bowed.`
`...But I didn't care about stuff like that.`
` I was more concerned with continuing their discussion.`
`"I told them I was going to the bathroom, so they let me go.`
` I thought I'd suffocate if I was locked up in that room any longer.`
`...When I was about to come ask you for some water, I overheard something pretty interesting.`
` ......You don't need to bow your heads or anything.`
` Please, let me hear the rest."`
`"............That just now, ......wasn't really......"`
`"I've been listening to you for a while.`
` Don't try to hide it now.`
`............So I'll ask directly.`
` ...Who is this Beatrice?`
` She's supposed to be a witch from a kid's story, but it doesn't look that way now."`
`"....................."`
`Kanon-kun averted his gaze.`
`...It was obvious that he didn't want to talk about this,`
` ...which only made me want to ask even more.`
` While making an effort to smile, I grabbed the collar of his shirt.`
`"......If it were last night, this'd be none of my business`
` But after this morning, everything's changed.`
` Now that Dad and the rest have been killed, this is totally my business.`
` .........I have the right to listen to this suspicious story, don't I...?"`
`Even so, I glared into Kanon's eyes as he kept trying to look away in apparent pain.`
` Since there was a big difference in our heights, Kanon had to stand on his toes and it looked like it hurt a bit.`
`"............Battler-san...`
`...please let go of him...`
` It's not like Kanon-san is really hiding anything..."`
`"Then you won't have any problem talking about it, right?`
` It's lonely being out of the loop, get it?"`
`When I tried to further twist up his collar, Genji-san cut between us and spoke.`
`...There was a slight sense of resignation on his face.`
`......It looked like he didn't plan on hiding anything.`
`".........I can talk about it.`
` ......Kanon only hesitated because you might have taken it badly, Battler-sama..."`
`"Hesitating isn't very manly, is it?`
` Keeping it a secret's even more unpleasant. `
`......Tell me about it.`
` It's not like we have anything better to do before tomorrow comes.`
` A slightly shady story might be the best way to stave off boredom."`
`After Genji-san and Kanon-kun looked at each other, they nodded as though they had decided to talk...`
`"......Understood.`
` Please ask us anything.`
` ............We will talk."`
`"Right.`
` Then I'll ask. `
`......Who in the world is Beatrice?`
` ...All I know is that she's a witch who lives in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` ...I've heard that it's a story that Grandmother or someone invented to keep people out of the dangerous forest.`
`......Is that wrong?"`
`"............No, ...it isn't wrong.`
` It's as you say.`
` Beatrice is a witch who dwells in the forest of Rokkenjima."`
`"......Battler-sama.`
` .........I don't expect you to believe this all of a sudden, but...`
` Beatrice-sama exists.`
` ...She is a real person, the one who gave the Master a vast amount of gold and who has worked by his side for many years."`
`"Huh...?`
` Ah, come on...`
` Is Grandfather paying you to repeat everything he says...?"`
`I laughed like it was a joke,`
` but neither Genji-san nor Kanon-kun laughed, `
`......not even Kumasawa baa-chan, who was avoiding my eyes, flustered, as she started washing the utensils.`
` So unfortunately, I was the only one laughing.`
` ...Painfully, bitterly.`
`"......I see, that's why Genji-san refused to mention it.`
` ...If you really mean it, of course I'd take it badly.`
` .............So you're saying that a person named Beatrice actually exists?"`
`"......Yes.`
` She was working for the Master since before the mansion was built on this island.`
` ...She has most likely been working for him even longer than I have."`
`"What do you know, Kyrie-san's theory was off...`
`......Grandfather really did have a confidante called Beatrice. `
`......Is that person on the island now...?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` I believe that she is here."`
`"...That's a vague way to say it.`
` I guess that means you haven't seen her face today or yesterday."`
`"......Yes.`
` ............It is extremely difficult to say, but..., `
`...umm..."`
`Kanon-kun once again dropped his gaze, avoiding my eyes.`
`"...Come on, don't just stop there.`
` That's like freezing an inch before the blow, right?"`
`I urged him on jokingly.`
`...However, it looked like Kanon was still confused as to whether he should speak or not.`
`.........Then, Kumasawa baa-chan whispered.`
`"...Hoh-hoh-hoh...`
` You cannot see her face, `
`.........because Beatrice-sama has no form..."`
`"............She has no, `
`.........what did you say?"`
`"Beatrice-sama has no body.`
` ...Therefore, unless Beatrice-sama wishes it, common people like us are not able to see her form."`
`"I have heard that the portrait shows what Beatrice-sama looked like back when she had a human form...`
`......It seems he yearned for that figure so much, he would often stand in front of that portrait...`
`...Hoh-hoh-hoh..."`
`"Beatrice-sama sometimes changes her form into glittering butterflies and shows herself.`
` ......On the rare occasion that you spot them somewhere in the mansion, there is a rule that you absolutely mustn't chase after them. `
`It is whispered that you will meet with disaster if you follow them.`
` ...In fact, there was a servant who broke that rule and quit because of a great injury."`
`"......Wait a sec, are you kidding me?`
` Are you all serious about this......?"`
`"...Battler-sama, Beatrice-sama has already arrived.`
` Such language may be unwise."`
`"Beatrice-sama does not like it when she is profaned.`
` ......If you doubt her existence, you will surely meet with disaster."`
`"Battler-san..., you probably find this story unpleasant.`
` But you know what?`
` Beatrice does 'exist', okay?"`
`"......She 'exists'.`
` Beatrice-sama hates people who doubt that."`
`"............Don't you understand, Battler-sama?`
` ......Beatrice-sama has already arrived here..."`
`"...Come on, quit it.`
` You know I'm weak against that stuff...`
` You're freaking me out..."`
`However, there was no trace of a joke in the eyes of the three servants.`
` On the surface, I laughed and tried to look unconcerned, but I was quickly starting to sober up.`
`...Their eyes were also sobering up fast.`
`"......Battler-san..., I beg that you stop profaning Beatrice-sama.`
` Please trust me..."`
`Kumasawa baa-chan, who was usually cheerful and would always tease people,`
` ......now spoke with a totally straight face.`
`".........W, ......well...`
` Sure you say she exists...`
` but I don't see anything...`
` Are you trying to say that she's standing right next to me or something?`
` Quit joking around..."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Just then, that unnerving laugh suddenly filled the kitchen...`
`...When I turned around, Maria was standing there by the entrance.`
`...But her expression and the feeling about her, her presence...felt exactly the same as the servants.`
`"...Whether your wavelength matches or not is determined at birth.`
` Battler, you were born with a mismatched wavelength.`
` That's why you can't see her.`
` That's why you can't meet with her,`
` and that's why you can't talk to her. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` You're the type Beatrice hates the most."`
`Maria's laugh almost sounded insane, ...and it was extremely eerie.`
`......It was almost like she was laughing at me because I alone didn't understand.`
`"Do you want to know about Beatrice?`
` ............Beatrice is a thousand year old witch.`
` ......With all of the demons at her command, she can harness the power of alchemy to create the philosopher's stone and a vast quantity of gold.`
` Grandfather built up all of the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family by making a contract with her.`
`......Yesterday, I read Beatrice's letter, didn't I?`
` That was real.`
` ...Well, I guess it's pointless for me to try and force you to believe. `
`...After all, it looks like you were born without a trace of the sixth sense.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` Witches, demons?`
` Who told you about that...?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` I heard it from Beatrice herself.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`Maria kept doing that unpleasant laugh.`
`...However, the servants who watched over this didn't even blink.`
` She heard it from...that witch in the portrait adorning the entrance hall.`
` Maria kept on laughing in a weird voice, as though this was nothing more or less than the truth...`
`"...Maria, it might be rude to ask, but I'll ask one more time, okay...?`
` Who gave you that letter yesterday?"`
`"I got it from Beatrice. How many times must I tell you before you understand? `
`......You don't get it, do you?`
` You can't see it.`
` You can't believe it, can you?`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Just then, Maria's laughter suddenly stopped.`
`".........Battler.`
` You still don't understand?`
` Beatrice-sama 'exists'."`
`"She 'exists', you say.........but where?"`
`"Like I said, Beatrice-sama 'exists' here."`
`......That's right.`
` Now that I think about it, I've been feeling for some time now that the others haven't been looking in quite the right direction.`
`...I'd figured that everyone had just been gazing into the distance, but......that wasn't the case.`
` The four here, Genji-san, `
`Kanon-kun, `
`Kumasawa-san, `
`and Maria,`
` ......everyone except me, `
`.........were looking at a spot right behind me......`
` Holding my breath tightly, I slowly looked over my shoulder.`
`...Of course, there wasn't anyone there.`
` I've known that the whole time!`
`.........However, everyone in the room except me was focusing on that point as if there was someone there.`
`"Beatrice is a great witch of gold who has lived for one thousand years.`
` ......But since she can't show her form to humans of the wrong wavelength, she can't talk to them. `
`...And you know what?`
` That's really sad.`
` ...It means that she truly despises it when people like you, who were born without a fragment of the ability needed to sense magic, deny that she exists...!`
`.........You're lucky, Battler.`
` Good thing that I gave you that charm yesterday, right?`
` Don't you realize what kind of curse Beatrice would have put on you by now if you hadn't been carrying it around?`
` ...You really are lucky, Battler.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`".........Right, that scorpion keyholder.`
` I'd thought that was just some cheap gift or something, but are you saying that really had some benefit?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihi. `
`If it weren't for that, you'd be lying in that storehouse as a sacrifice with your face crushed by now.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi, you're so lucky, Battler...!`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"......I see.`
` So if it weren't for that, I'd have been killed by now......"`
`"Battler, why don't you believe in Beatrice...?`
` Even though she 'exists'.`
` Right now, over there, look. `
`Kihihihihihihihi!`
` Hey, I'll bet you want to believe it now.`
` Believe it.`
` And thank me for giving you that charm...! `
`If it weren't for that, you'd be in the storehouse right now.`
` But then, maybe you would have saved someone else in exchange, right?`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`*pop*.`
`......Right then, I burst into laughter.`
` Playing witches had been pretty fun up until a second ago, but unfortunately, that last one seemed to be too much for me to gloss over.`
`"Hahahahahahah.`
` ......Then it's all useless, isn't it, Maria?`
` If that's true, then I'm sorry, but it's all useless."`
`When Maria saw me suddenly start laughing, she stopped.`
` Even though she didn't understand what I was laughing at, she realized it wouldn't be pleasant for her.`
`".................."`
`"I thought it might hurt you, so I didn't say it earlier, but...`
`...Although I thought I'd put that charm you gave me in my pocket, `
`I must have dropped it somewhere, you see?`
`......That means the charm can't be the only reason I'm alive now, and even though I should have been cursed by the witch, I'm perfectly fine.`
` ......Sorry, but I don't believe in things I don't see with my own eyes.`
` Sixth sense?`
` Wavelengths?`
` Magic sensitivity?`
` Sorry, but I don't believe in fake stuff like that.`
` When I hear the girls in class start talking about how good or bad their ability to sense the supernatural is, it pisses me off!`
` ...I don't know how much Grandfather is paying you, but if you're trying to talk me into joining some cult,`
` believe me, you won't be able to do it that easily."`
`"............Battler-sama..."`
`"...You guys are free to believe whatever you want. `
`However, when it comes to the things I believe, `
`I am `
`always `
`the one who decides! `
`Sorry, but I can't believe in something as shady as Beatrice until I've seen her with my own eyes...!!"`
`I spoke forcefully and sharply...`
` When I did, Maria started cackling again.`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
` Well that's just fine, isn't it...? `
`Eventually, even people like you with totally mismatched wavelengths will be able to see Beatrice.`
`.........Very soon, she will revive.`
` Beatrice will revive.`
` ......Once that happens, she's promised to talk with me and play with me a lot. `
`...There's absolutely no need to doubt or to force you to believe.`
` ......She will appear, very soon.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`Some people usually head to the bathroom after a meal; others prefer to take a short nap.`
` It seemed that several people had gone out of the parlor, just like I did when I went to the kitchen to drink some water.`
` In the end, Natsuhi's order to keep everyone packed together in the parlor,`
` that no one be left alone`
` and that no one leave the parlor,`
` had to be withdrawn, however reluctantly.`
` In any case, if eleven people are shut up in the same room starting early in the morning,　the air will start to get stagnate.`
`...And after a little time had passed, everyone had started to recover from the shock of that morning. Maybe their sense of danger was weakening over time.`
`......However, it was a certain fact that six people had been killed inside this mansion,`
` so no one was completely negligent.`
` So when they went out into the hallway for a breath of fresh air, trying to act tough,`
` ......they would quickly get scared of standing there, isolated, `
`and would eventually return to the parlor.`
`...I guess it's like 'The North Wind and the Sun'.`
` If you force someone to stay shut in, they'll resist, but if you tell them to do whatever they want, they'll come back, obediently.`
` People sure are hypocrites.`
`.........When the servants finished cleaning up from the meal, `
`they returned obediently to the parlor just as Natsuhi oba-san had told them to, and sat in a sofa near the entrance, patiently awaiting orders.`
` Maria, almost as though she had suddenly finished playing witches,`
` had returned to the pure Maria I knew well, saying 'uu-uu-'.`
`...What in the world was that back there?`
`.........I hadn't felt even an atom of the presence of this person called Beatrice, supposedly standing behind me, invisible.`
`...However, it felt like, inside Maria, I could catch a glimpse of a little of that presence...`
`"You're right.`
` When Maria starts talking about witches, she changes.`
` ...Battler-kun, you also saw it down by the beach yesterday, right?"`
`"You mean that scorpion keyholder?`
` ...No, I don't mean like when her feelings were hurt,`
` I'm talking about when she looked like she had a dual personality."`
`"Aah, that happens sometimes.`
` ......Just like when Maria started talking about the magic circle, that just happens sometimes.`
` It's freaky though."`
`According to Jessica, it seems that she's spotted the 'Kihihihihihi' laughing Maria a few times.`
` This was just bad timing, and furthermore, it was the first time I'd seen it so it really shocked me...`
`"So what is that?`
` Does Maria have a dual personality or something?`
` Or are you saying that her spiritual sense really is that strong, and she's being possessed by it?"`
`"...No, I don't think it's that.`
` Haven't you ever experienced it?`
` When you were small, did you have someone other than yourself who you wanted to be?"`
`Right when humans are born, no one has any individuality,`
`Even so, when they reach their growth period, their sense of self starts to be born, and they start to gain a sense of individuality.`
` They want to be different from other people.`
`...But that doesn't mean that they will find that they're different from the others in their class, `
`since they are learning the same thing in school and forced into the same lifestyle.`
` When they realize that, they start off by breaking the rules, in what's called the rebellious age.`
` Since everyone follows the rules, they want to show off their individuality by breaking them.`
`...Even people who call this behavior childish and make fun of it,`
` will realize that it's just a cute kid searching for themselves when they look at it this way.`
`......Well, I'm lecturing about all this like I'm so smart, but I actually got it second hand from George-aniki.`
` I myself was one of those embarrassing guys who thought it was cool to act like a little bastard...`
` Well, that was when I was the age where you try standing out for the opposite sex.`
`"The whole point of the growing period is that people try to separate themselves from being a kid. It's the same impulse as a chick trying to crack the shell of their egg.`
` Do you know what the difference between a child and an adult is?"`
`"Age?`
` Or is it the condition of their body?"`
`"No, it's experience.`
` Adults can look down on children because children have very little life experience.`
` The reason they snort and look down on children whenever they say anything is because children don't know anything about the world."`
`"Yeah, I understand that.`
` When you're a kid, you try to say things like you've got life all figured out, and try to act like an adult.`
` ...No matter what a kid says, adults will just snort at them because they're too naive or because they'd 'understand once they grew up' or something. `
`...Well, it's probably true, but to a kid, it's just annoying, like they're being looked down upon."`
`"......I get it.`
` It's about whether they have knowledge and experience.`
` ...Of course, age isn't something to respect if a person's just wasted their lives."`
`"Therefore, during the period when they try to separate themselves from other children, they also try to take on personalities different from those around them. `
`If what separates kids and adults is knowledge and experience, then...?"`
`"............I get it, if they know something that no one else knows, it becomes part of their identity."`
`"You know, when I was in elementary school, I'd learn things no one else knew,`
` get things no one else had, and wear things no one else wore, and became a bit of a hero for it.`
` I'll bet you have done the same thing, Battler."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` There was definitely an age when I wanted to excel in something.`
` ...I see, that was because I was trying to separate myself from being a child, my growing period."`
`"If you look at it in a good way, the growing period, by forcing you to separate yourself from others, pushes you to gain skills and knowledge that no one else has. `
`...This is also interesting from a sociological standpoint.`
` Because people hate being like everyone else, they try to learn skills that other people don't know.`
` In this way, society can acquire the broad range of skills it needs to survive.`
` ...The quality of the gods' programming is truly surprising."`
`"Well, individual personalities can also be negative, right?`
` Like when everyone in the class is studying hard, and I'm just slacking off, it sticks out."`
`...I actually had been like that.`
` Only recently, I'd finally been able to thank that middle school teacher who had slapped me after school.`
`"But, well, I'd try to jump over things that no one else could,`
` sprint as fast as I could, trying to lap those guys with good grades when we did a marathon. I just felt like doing it.`
` ...It was in my nature that, if I couldn't study well, then at least I could get back at them by exercising. `
`......I get it, I really went all out during my growing period."`
`"After all, boys do tend to focus more on physical things. `
`But you know? Girls of the same age tend to focus more on emotional things.`
` ......I'll bet there were groups of girls in your classes that were really interested in fortune telling and their spiritual senses."`
`"Yeah, yeah! There was, there was!`
` They'd come over, asking me for my sign and my blood type! And then they'd laugh 'Aah, I thought so, *giggle* *giggle*!'`
` It really got on my nerves. `
`No matter which class you go to, girls like fortune telling.`
` Deciding whether your spirit sense was strong or weak, what your sensitivity was, whether you could see things that couldn't be seen. That kind of thing definitely happened."`
`"That's because fortune telling and spiritual senses are things that aren't taught in school.`
` To girls, who unlike guys are more introverted, `
`that's a genre which is easy to build an identity upon, and one that they find very interesting."`
`"Just like when boys enter their growing period, and start acting tough and rebel against adults,`
` when girls enter their growing period, they start getting interested in that kind of thing. `
`......Well, I didn't though!"`
`"......So Maria having so much interest in the occult isn't that rare among girls her age?"`
`...Even if you accept that, ...I wonder if it explains that creepy dual personality thing...`
`............Well, I think I can accept it vaguely.`
`"As you just said, becoming an adult means gaining knowledge and experience.`
` We have to teach kids various things so that they can gain knowledge and truly awaken. `
`...A child's world, both now and in the past, grows rapidly, and there are some delusions which are convenient during that time.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"You see it all the time in manga and anime right?`
` It's kinda like that.`
` Like memories from antiquity are revived.`
` Like someone's possessed by the soul of the great something, or whatever."`
`"Ah, and also like a sleeping gene gets awakened,`
` or maybe a sealed power or memory returns. There's a lot of that.`
` For some reason, those kinds of things are really popular at that age.`
` ...Why's that?"`
`"All of those examples you've just mentioned are illusions that children can add to their knowledge and experience immediately.`
` If a nine year old girl says that she has a thousand year old witch possessing her,`
` it's because by saying that, she gains a 1009 year old identity."`
`"So what you're saying is that studying is annoying.`
` But to people who want to learn different skills from everyone else and brag about it, and get attention from it, it's a convenient delusion."`
`So she could brag about something without having to work hard or study.`
`......I see, isn't that a kid's greatest dream?`
`"Furthermore, in their desire to separate themselves from being kids, they always project an image of their ideal imagination,`
` and it's not rare for the image of their desire to become an alternate personality. `
`Even you, Battler-kun, I'm sure your character is a little different at home and at school, right?`
` It would probably be embarrassing if anyone at school saw how you were at home.`
` At school, you try to project yourself as you want to be, but home is where you are your true self."`
`".........So, in other words, I'm changing my character for different situations.`
` ......Are you trying to say that having multiple personalities is actually really common?"`
`"A girl who is a fan of the occult might say that she's being possessed and then reawakened.`
` Honestly, there are some kids who can suddenly change their personalities. `
`......Even some boys, right?`
` Guys who just blow their top and suddenly become violent.`
` I'll bet they think it's pretty cool, but it's painful to watch."`
`"So let's sum this all up.`
` ...Girls of about Maria's age, even if they show a creepy second personality like she did a minute ago,`
` you're saying that's not such a rare thing...?"`
`"If you bring it all together simply, that's what it means.`
` ...Identity is an important thing used to build up one's sense of self.`
` If you make fun of that, it could actually cause children to go back into their shell. `
`So it's important to go along with them to some degree.`
` ...Although whether that is accepted is determined by the broad-mindedness of the parent."`
`"......Aniki, I can't believe you aren't married...`
` You sound like you've already raised kids through middle school. `
`.........So, I wonder if Rosa oba-san also knew much about Maria's dual personality."`
`"She knew about it.`
` .........Just between us, Rosa oba-san really hated it.`
` She said it was unpleasant, and that Maria was becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the class.`
` So any time Maria started talking about the occult or laughing like a witch, she would slap her. `
`...And it looks like Maria stopped talking that way in front of her."`
`.........Maybe it was just a little game, from a girl facing her growing period,`
` ...that thing that had happened back there.`
` Just a girl trying to show that she was different and independent by holding interest in witches and the occult.`
`...And since she wanted to be different from herself, young as she was, she was switching between her normal personality and the personality of her ideal, a witch.`
`.........In the beginning, I had found that very disturbing,`
` but after being lectured to by George-aniki, it felt like this was a path that everyone walked down at one time or another.`
`......I haven't told anyone, but when I was in kindergarten,`
` I joined up with a little gang of kids trying to form a Earth Defense Force, saying we'd help protect peace on earth.`
` My face turns red when I remember how, during what we called battle practice, we would chant EDF!EDF!...`
` Just like usual, Maria was relaxing,`
` immersed in the TV, 'uu-uu-'ing and laughing just like any girl her age.`
`......But on the inside, another personality, that of the ideal witch that she respected and blindly accepted, was sleeping.`
` But that wasn't anything extraordinary. It was perfectly natural for a girl of her age...`
`............I calmed down a little.`
` I had started to recover from that mysterious shock I had received in the kitchen.`
` If I hadn't talked to Aniki and Jessica, I might still be frightened by the idea that an invisible witch was standing right behind me.`
`...However, ......can I really accept that as an explanation of what happened back there? `
`If it had just been Maria, I could have explained it as the fickle delusions of a growing girl.`
` But Genji-san, Kanon-kun, and Kumawasa baa-chan had also been there.`
` None of them had denied what Maria said.`
`.........They had silently accepted that Beatrice 'exists'.`
` I was starting to feel a little uneasy...`
` Eva oba-san had claimed that no 19th person exists,`
` saying that someone within the family's messy quarrel had committed the crime.`
` On the other hand, Natsuhi oba-san had claimed that the culprit was hiding somewhere outside the mansion.`
` That meant that she was denying that the crime had been committed by one of us, and accepting that a 19th person exists.`
` And in the kitchen, Maria and the servants had agreed that a 19th person exists.`
` But according to them, this 19th person isn't human.`
`......They had said that it was an invisible witch, plotting something mysterious.`
` Was there a 19th person, or not? `
`And was the culprit a human, or a witch? `
`For some reason, I couldn't just laugh it off.`
`...Even the most ridiculous story about the witch.`
`"......Jessica, `
`all I know about the story of the witch is that it was a story made by the adults to keep the kids too scared to enter the forest, but...`
`...is it different here in the mansion...?"`
`"............Hmmm...`
` I have the same view as you, okay? `
`I think it was just a stupid ghost story made by the parents so that their kids would listen to them.`
` ......But I can't deny that the atmosphere inside the mansion makes it a little hard to say it out loud..."`
`"......Because Grandfather has proclaimed that Beatrice does exist.`
` And because of their position, the servants can't doubt that. `
`Even Krauss oji-san doesn't want to get into a fight with him, so on the surface, they go along with it.`
` ......So you could probably say that, inside this mansion, doubting the existence of Beatrice is taboo.`
` Unlike the rest of us, who only come here once a year.`
` ......Is that right?"`
`Jessica took a deep breath in admiration...`
` It looked like Aniki had guessed right.`
`"......It's just like you say.`
` No one really believes it on the inside.`
` ...But on the outside, they accept that she exists. `
`See, it's just like the way some people are about gods.`
` Even though they know god doesn't exist, they feel like it would be uncouth if they actually said that out loud..."`
`"......How do you think the servants feel about it amongst themselves?`
` Is it true that, since their employer says she 'exists', they have to go along with it...?"`
`"Well...`
` I don't really know the details, `
`......but between the servants, the story about Beatrice has been treated a little like a ghost story. `
`...Remember yesterday? When Shannon was talking to us down by the beach?`
` That story about how one night, when she was doing the rounds in the mansion, she saw something unsettling."`
`She had said something like that, hadn't she...`
` Back then, `
`I had thought she was just being really nice to help improve Maria's mood,`
` ...but it had felt like she was serious when she said it.`
`......That's right, she definitely said it.`
`...She definitely said the same kind of thing that Genji and the rest had all unanimously declared back in the kitchen...`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` Kanon-kun also saw something like that when he went patrolling one night.`
` And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that the Beatrice-sama from the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion.`
` ...It happened a long time ago, but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`......That's right, `
`she definitely said that.`
` Exactly the same thing that I had been told just now.`
`"Ah, ...but, there's nothing to be afraid of, right?`
` Beatrice-sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` Therefore, don't be strangely afraid. If you respect her, she won't do anything bad."`
`"However, it would be dreadful if you didn't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that, just before I began working, `
`someone who spoke badly about Beatrice-sama fell down the stairs and quit after receiving a large injury to their back.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that Beatrice-sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"......If you don't respect her, her anger will be brought down upon you and you will be injured.`
` ...So, to the servants, Beatrice's existence `
`is just as credible as the story that, if you pull pranks on {c:86EF9C:Inari-san}, you will receive {c:86EF9C:Kitsune-sama's} curse."`
`Of course, even though everyone accepts that curses and the like don't exist in the modern era,`
` ...people are still afraid and still have a little respect for them.`
` You often see it when, in a residential area, someone is building a house, and they call a Shinto priest for a ceremony to honor the god of that plot of land.`
`...You might think that was just a big waste of time and money,`
` but it is said that if the workers don't do that, a big accident will occur, so they never neglect to do it.`
` You also hear about how, if an Inari shrine is carelessly removed during a town replanning,`
` there would be a curse by Kitsune-sama.`
` I think I might have read somewhere that when the occupying forces were trying to expand an airport, and had to remove a Inari-san that was in the way,`
` all of the workers were suddenly taken out by some mysterious fever.`
` Even in modern cities like Tokyo, `
`it wasn't rare to see modern buildings packed all around an old Inari shrine, leaving the shrine itself untouched.`
` And this wasn't limited to Japan.`
` It's probably similar to how people baptize babies.`
` Of course, by the Christian doctrine,`
` if unbaptized souls have even the slightest amount of sin, they will still go to hell.`
` Putting water on a child's forehead doesn't do anything but make them cry.`
` But if by doing just that, parents can prevent their children from going to hell, they will happily go through with that ceremony.`
`......In short, even in this modern society of reason,`
` we were still unable to throw away every trace of belief and fear.`
`...You could say that it was a passive acceptance of the supernatural.`
` Maybe the only difference on this island was that Beatrice was the name that was respected here...`
`"...So, in other words,`
` if anything happens that doesn't seem explainable in human terms, it's called the work of Beatrice. `
`.........I think Shannon-chan said it.`
` Windows and doors and locks that were tightly shut would be open the next time you went to check them.`
` Lights that should have been on went out, and lights that should have been out were turned on.`
`......And after all, like Jessica was joking about, sometimes when she went to leave in the morning, she couldn't find her shoes. That was also the work of Beatrice, right?"`
`"I remember it well. `
`...Normally, you'd say some little imps took them, but on this island, it's Beatrice.`
` Man, what a stupid story."`
`"This mansion has been standing for about thirty years by now, hasn't it?`
` It's natural for things that old to get their fair share of ghost and occult stories.`
` Like the seven mysteries at a school."`
`"............So is that where we `
`'turn the chessboard over'...?"`
`"Huh?"`
`".........In other words, on this island, there's a rule that Beatrice is blamed for anything that couldn't have been done by humans.`
` Things that humans can't do.`
` ......How many humans are there?`
` There's 18.`
` ............So the culprit, knowing about this rule, wanted to make it appear that this crime was the work of the witch.`
` If that were the case, we would have to accept that a 19th person was responsible.............`
` I don't like it.`
` I really don't like it."`
`"What don't you like...?"`
`"Just assume that an invisible 19th person existed, and that this person wanted to make it known that they existed.`
` If it were me, I could do it with even more perfect timing."`
`"......What do you mean by perfect timing?"`
`"...Well.`
` After all, the crime probably took place after midnight while it was still dark, right?`
` Until midnight, people were talking together, some people had the night shift, and some people had returned to their rooms and were sleeping. `
`...Everyone's alibi is really vague, and there's plenty of room to suspect that the crime was committed by one of us.`
` George-aniki, Eva oba-san probably told you too, right?`
` That there's a good chance that one of us is the culprit?"`
`"...n, ......yes.`
` ...I guess."`
`"......In other words, if the 19th person really existed and wanted to show themselves, this first crime was a complete failure. `
`...No, in the first place, it was a mistake in the timing.`
` If this invisible 19th person really wanted to show themselves, `
`they had to make sure that the crime took place under conditions which proved that the remaining twelve people were all innocent.`
` Unless there are no suspicious humans, they can't prove that they exist.`
` So by killing them in the middle of the night, when everyone's alibis were at their most ambiguous,`
` whether or not this 19th person exists was also at its most ambiguous.`
` Even so, they chose that time to commit the crime."`
`"......By committing the crime then, it's obvious that one of the 18 would be suspected.`
` ...Even so, everyone has denied that they were the one who took the name of the witch and handed Maria the letter."`
`"In other words, ......you're trying to say that one of the 18 is trying to make it look like a 19th person called Beatrice exists...? `
`That's pretty crazy......`
`...I think that my mom's theory that someone is hiding outside the mansion is a little more credible...`
`...Battler, do you actually suspect that someone in this room is the culprit...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Someone trying to force us to accept that Beatrice exists.`
` ......That's right, the letter last night is when this whole thing started.`
` ...I don't have any basis or proof, but... `
`......With the chessboard upside-down, this is my best guess."`
`"......Seriously, that's too crazy...`
` Haven't you been reading too many weird detective novels...?"`
`"But it's a viewpoint that we can't ignore.`
` ......Whether there's a 19th person or not, `
`the culprit is definitely planning something involving that rule about this island. `
`......Just now, listening to Battler-kun talk, I've remembered something that's a little disturbing."`
`"Something disturbing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Do you remember?`
` Beatrice's letter.`
` ......It said that Beatrice was going to collect interest.`
` And by interest, it mentioned everything of the Ushiromiya family."`
`Jessica and I thought back on what Maria had read aloud the previous night...`
`"...It said that.`
` It definitely said that.`
` That the collecting of the interest would now take place, but if the riddle of the gold could be solved, she would lose that right."`
`"...Grandfather was granted the gold, and the Ushiromiya house prospered.`
` In other words, Beatrice is talking about the interest on all of the gold that was created.`
` ......In other words..."`
`".........That's pretty scary for a joke, Aniki...`
`......You don't mean, everything of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...in other words, everything that Grandfather gave birth to,`
` ......in other words, everyone with Grandfather's blood flowing through their veins...!?"`
`"If you read the letter that way,`
` ...these murders are just Beatrice legitimately collecting interest.`
` ...If that's the case, these crimes will continue.`
` ...Because the collection of interest is still only halfway completed."`
`George turned around, looking over the parlor.`
`......There were still many people who held the name Ushiromiya.`
` And we knew that, since Gohda-san and Shannon-chan had been killed,`
` not even the servants, who didn't bear the name Ushiromiya, would be spared...`
`"A, ...are you, `
`.........saying that we're all gonna be killed...? `
`...But that's weird, George nii-san!`
` In that case, why only six people?`
` They should have killed a lot more.`
` In the worst case, it should have been possible for them to assault everyone while they were sleeping and kill them.`
` Why didn't they do that?!"`
`"............The special clause.`
` ...If someone managed to solve the riddle of the gold, the right to the interest would be lost.`
` ......And the very last part of the letter is tied in with this, right?`
` ...It said to try and solve the riddle of Grandfather's gold."`
`"Jesus...!`
` ......It looks like we're finally getting close to understanding the culprit's message...`
` In other words, the culprit is telling us to try and solve the riddle on that epitaph Grandfather had made.`
`......Furthermore, they're saying that if we just sit around, they'll keep collecting the interest..."`
`I realized that this was all based on several crazy guesses.`
`......But not everything that happens in this world fits together in a perfect line.`
`...Most of the events that we don't know about yet are only individual points.`
`......By fitting them into a straight line, I was beginning to understand.`
` The closer the points are to the line, the easier it is, intellectually, to understand them.`
`...And the farther away they are from the line, the more fragmented everything becomes.`
` Therefore, as far the distance between these guesses was concerned, we should call this theory crazy.`
`...However, if the distance is narrow between the points, you could call the idea limited.`
` Would that idea be any different from reasoning? `
`Was I just trying to force everything that I knew about the case to fit my simple imagination? `
`No, that's not it.`
` When you're searching around with your hands in the dark, that search is imagination.`
` Only imagination can find points that fit with each other.`
`...Reasoning is nothing more than tying those lines together.`
` If you can't imagine, you can't reason.`
`......What I was doing might have been crazy, ...but it also wasn't a mistake.`
` Only the power of imagination could pull out a clue from the darkness.`
`......And the power of reasoning could tie those clues together.`
`...It was a lot like the process of searching out an enemy's weak spot and striking.`
` It's alright if it's crazy.`
` Find the weak point first.`
` Then we can think about how to strike! `
`Now was the time to find the points that we could tie together later...! `
`For the time being, I put aside whether a 19th person exists,`
` and announced the theory that the goal of the culprit might have been to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Hideyoshi oji-san looked like he was really interested, but Natsuhi oba-san thought it was ridiculous.`
`"Of course.`
` If you think about it that way, even that letter from yesterday makes sense.`
` That motive seems to fit pretty well with the facts...!`
` Settin' aside whoever it was that gave Maria-chan the letter."`
`"Uu-!`
` Beatrice exists!!`
` Uu-."`
`Even though she was puffing up her cheeks in that cute way she had been doing since yesterday, ...I couldn't think of it as cute.`
`...If I took it lightly, it might suddenly transform into a creepy laugh...`
`"The hidden gold doesn't exist.`
` However, the culprit, who foolishly believes that it does, wants Father's gold.`
` If their motive is to make us solve the riddle and then steal the gold from us, then I will agree that it makes sense.`
` However, in that case, why did they kill those most highly ranked in the Ushiromiya family first?"`
`".........That makes sense.`
` If they wanted to make us solve the riddle, killing those closest to Kinzo-san doesn't sound like a good plan to me."`
`"Really...?`
` But if we follow that argument, wouldn't it have been quicker if they had threatened Father in the first place?`
` You'd think it would be faster to just ask the person who wrote it, rather than try to force us to solve it."`
`"That's also a good point.`
` ...However, I don't think that Father would let it slip because of any ordinary threat."`
`"Anyone who knows Kinzo-san well would probably realize that he won't bow to ordinary threats..."`
`"......He is a man who bears the burden of all the Ushiromiya family's wealth.`
` He's been exposed to many threats and attacks in the past.`
` It is because he was able to overcome them that the family prospers today."`
`"That's freakin' right.`
` I can't even imagine that our Grandfather would obey if someone threatened him!"`
`"...Jessica, watch your language."`
`"............u, `
`......Yes."`
`"In that case, .........what about this idea?`
` ...No wait, is that too crazy...?"`
`...I couldn't hesitate! `
`A crazy idea was like a bow and arrow.`
`...It might be hard to hit with, but if you could strike the enemy on the other side, it was a great weapon.`
`......They say that most people who have died in battles were killed by wounds from arrows.`
`......In a battle you couldn't just shoot off one arrow.`
` You shoot off a whole bunch of arrows at once, and attack the enemy soldiers with a wall of them.`
` ......So shoot them, over and over!`
`'Attack with a wall of truth...!'`
`"If the culprit is after the hidden gold, it would be very ineffective for them to force us to solve the riddle.`
` Asking the person who made it in the first place would be much quicker and easier. `
`.........In that case, the question is,`
` ...is this all a message directed at Grandfather?"`
`In other words, this murder was a threat directed at Grandfather.`
`......If he didn't tell the culprit where the gold was, his family members would be killed off one by one.`
` What if we weren't the only ones being forced to solve this riddle...`
`...what if Grandfather was too?! `
`If you think about it that way, it explained Grandfather's mysterious disappearance.`
` If the culprit had attacked Grandfather, then judging by the state the six corpses were left in,`
` he should have been displayed somewhere with that horrible makeup added.`
` But despite that, we still hadn't found him.`
`......Did that mean that Grandfather was kidnapped, and had been taken somewhere?!`
`".........How could...`
`.........You aren't saying, how could......!"`
`"*giggle* *giggle*.`
` That sounds interesting.`
` ...So Grandfather is being confined somewhere,`
` and being threatened that if he doesn't tell them the location of the gold, we will be killed off one by one?"`
`"It pains me to think about how you find that interesting...!"`
`Natsuhi oba-san threatened her, but Eva oba-san just smiled calmly.`
`"......Since we still haven't seen him after all this time, I think that it's almost certain that Grandfather has gotten caught up in the crime.`
` If you think about it, you can't just ignore Battler-kun's theory, right...?"`
`"Stay quiet George.`
` ......When did Father disappear in the first place?"`
`"...Who was the last person to see Father?"`
`".........It was probably me.`
` This morning, when we were worried that we didn't know where my husband and the rest were, we were talking about how they might be in Father's study,`
` and I went to check his room and greeted him. `
`.........Come to think of it, I've been holding the key to his study the whole time, haven't I.`
` Genji, let me return this to you."`
`Natsuhi oba-san pulled out the gold key and handed it to Genji...`
` Looking at the key, Eva oba-san giggled...`
`"...Hey, Genji-san.`
` I'm sure the police will inspect Father's room thoroughly anyway.`
` ...If there's anything hidden there, it will just be exposed anyway.`
` ......So maybe it would be better if you just told us about it right here, right now."`
`"............What are you talking about?"`
`"It's simple.`
` .........Father's study is a closed room, with no way in or out except for that key, right?`
` I want to verify whether that's true.`
` There is one entrance to Father's study.`
` What about the window?`
` Any other entrances or exits?"`
`"............There are none.`
` There is no way to get in except the entrance."`
`"You're sure about that?`
` There isn't some secret hidden door or anything?`
` ......Since Father isn't here, I am the highest ranked member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am asking you as a representative of the Ushiromiya family head.`
` Understand that and answer me.`
` Are there any ways in or out of that room other than the main entrance?`
` ......As Father's closest aide, I'm sure you know."`
`Natsuhi oba-san looked a little offended at the part about the 'highest ranked family member',`
` but she kept her mouth closed for the time being, and waited for Genji's answer.`
`......I couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.`
` Why was she going on and on about hidden doors...??`
`"You, too, Kanon-kun, Kumasawa-san. If you know, won't you tell me?`
` If there is one, it would be better if you said it. `
`...If there isn't, then someone might be driven into a corner in a second.`
` ......If we assume that there is a hidden door, then my argument comes to nothing."`
`Eva oba-san didn't specify which person was about to be driven into a corner,`
` ...but following the flow of the conversation, I had to feel that she was referring to Natsuhi oba-san.`
`"......Mother, what are you talking about?"`
`"George, stay quiet for a while.`
` .........What do you say?`
` Genji-san?`
` Kanon-kun?`
` Or Kumasawa-san?`
` Is there a hidden door?`
` Is there not one?`
` Genji-san, when you remodeled Father's study, you must have overseen the construction.`
` I won't let you say that you don't know."`
`"............There is nothing like that in the Master's study."`
`"You're sure?`
` What about Kanon-kun, trusted by the One-winged Eagle?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I'm sure.`
` ......There is nothing like a hidden door in the Master's study."`
`"Kumasawa-san?"`
`"N, ......no, I haven't heard of such a thing..."`
`"What about Doctor Nanjo, who had a close relationship with Father?"`
`"......I, I have never heard of something like that..."`
`"Great!`
` Then are you ready?`
` Let me begin.`
` It's really simple."`
`Everyone tilted their head doubtfully, wondering what Eva oba-san was so proudly starting to talk about.`
`...Eva oba-san laughed triumphantly, as though she were about to reveal a secret that only she knew.`
`"Natsuhi nee-san was the last person to spot Father, right?`
` ...I forget the exact time, but I think it was a little before 9:00 in the morning. `
`......Nee-san, do you remember?`
` I ran into you just as you were coming out of Father's study, right?"`
`"......Yes, I remember.`
` What does that have to do with anything?"`
`"And the next time Nee-san went to visit Father's study?`
` That was after we had found the bodies of Nii-san and the rest, right?`
` Together with me, you went up to the study to report that, and we discovered that he wasn't there. `
`.........By the way, Nee-san.`
` At that time, when you went to enter Father's study, did you notice anything?"`
`".........Notice anything?`
` ...What are you talking about?"`
`"Come on.`
` You threw away some trash, right?`
` A folded receipt."`
`"......I do seem to remember throwing away some trash.`
` What does that have to do with...?"`
`"I got that receipt when I bought some candy at a store in the airport."`
`Eva oba-san pulled a small bag of candy out of her handbag.`
`"...Aah, the receipt from when you bought that candy?`
` ...But Mother, what does that receipt have to do with anything...?"`
`"George, stay quiet and listen for just a little longer..."`
`Hideyoshi oji-san's expression was a little strict.`
`...Somehow, it seemed that he understood what Eva oba-san was getting at.`
`"It was really just on a whim, you see?`
` Maybe I had a little foresight, `
`but I definitely wasn't planning on setting a trap for Natsuhi nee-san or anything. `
`......Actually, this receipt -`
` you remember, Nee-san, that just after you met Father and left, you met me right?`
` At that time, I stuck this into the door to the study."`
`"......So, what does that mean?`
` Does it meant that, until Natsuhi oba-san picked up that receipt, no one opened the door...?"`
`"W, wait a second, Eva oba-san...!`
` Sticking a receipt in would be obvious!`
` It's possible that, when Grandfather opened the door, he noticed it and, finding it interesting, stuck it back in the door..."`
`Jessica hurriedly argued back.`
`...She still didn't really know what it meant,`
` but she realized that, whatever it was, it would raise doubts about her own mother.`
`"Of course, I folded the receipt up very small so that no one would notice it.`
` But even if you assume that he saw it fall, he would have no way of knowing how high up the door it had been stuck, right? `
`I checked it while Natsuhi nee-san was taking the key out.`
` The receipt was still stuck not one millimeter away from where I had put it...!"`
`"I, ......I can't understand why you would pull such a childish prank!`
` I, I'll bet you were the one who did that prank on the door to my room, too!"`
`"......The door to Natsuhi-san's room?"`
`"...It was unpleasant to talk about, so I didn't,`
` but this morning, when I woke up, there were the signs of some prank on the outside of my door, with what was probably the same red paint that was scribbled across the shutter.`
` There were some unpleasant marks, as though someone had been tearing at the door..."`
`"Wait, what is this!`
` Why have you been silent about this until now...!!?"`
`"My apologies.`
` Since so many horrible things have occurred since then, I had completely forgotten about it until just now."`
`"I don't know anything about that.`
` What I did wasn't to your door, but the door to Father's room, right?`
` After you checked that he was in his room, and until we made sure that he wasn't, that door wasn't opened even once.`
` How did Father get out if he didn't use the door?"`
`".........I, ...I don't know that...!`
` That's what I want to know!!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee-san, other than you, who else checked to see whether Father was in his room?"`
`"Last night, the last time I met Kinzo-san was when we were playing chess...`
`...so I was with him until just before dinner......"`
`"Who saw him after that?"`
`"...............I did.`
` I gave him his dinner last night."`
`"......Yes.`
` Shannon and I were with him."`
`"So at that time, Father was still definitely in his room. `
`...However, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` When you found out that he wasn't there, I hear that all ways in or out of the study were closed, right?`
` ......But even so, you said that she met with him this morning."`
`"......I, ......I don't understand why everyone has become so gloomy.`
` Could someone explain it to me...?"`
`"F, ......Father and Mother are you`
`.........saying that what Natsuhi says about meeting Grandfather this morning `
`......is a lie?"`
`"How could she tell a lie? Mom's innocent!!`
` Why would she lie!!"`
`"Jessica!`
` I keep telling you to watch your language!"`
`All at once, everything became confused...`
` Eva oba-san and Natsuhi oba-san confronted each other across the parlor table,`
` with George confronting Jessica...`
`......What in the world...!!`
`"Many people spotted him last night, right?`
` But since this morning, the only one who claims that they saw Father is Natsuhi nee-san. `
`......And then there's that strange fact we learned from the receipt.`
` ...So, how can we connect these points together...?"`
`Eva oba-san urged everyone to imagine it...`
`......Sure, that receipt could become an important point.`
`...But I didn't know what kind of line could be drawn through that point...! `
`The answer Eva oba-san was hoping for,`
` .........was that Natsuhi oba-san had lied about seeing Grandfather in that room this morning.`
` Had Eva oba-san's whim exposed that......??`
`"I don't get it at all!!`
` Why would Mom have to lie!!?`
` She had no reason to, right!!?"`
`"......That's what I want to know. `
`But Jessica-chan.`
` You can't say that there was no reason for her to lie and say that Grandfather was in the room, right?`
` You see it every once in a while in mystery novels, don't you?`
` That trick of confusing the time of death to create an alibi."`
`"Wh, what are you talking about?!`
` I've never heard of that!!"`
`"...We still haven't found him yet, but if you think about it normally, it would be natural to assume that he has already been killed.`
` In that case, we would expect to find his corpse soon.`
` ...If, at that point, the time of death could be faked, Natsuhi nee-san would be able to create an alibi.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` Everyone?"`
`...This morning, when Natsuhi oba-san went to check that Grandfather was there, she lied,`
` ...and he was already dead at that time?`
`...And then, she moved the body to some location, and disguised it to make it seem like he had just been killed there.`
`......And then she could stay with everyone else to prepare an alibi.`
`......And then, she could say 'I heard someone screaming!'`
` or something and dash over there, and become the first to find the body along with everyone else..., is that what Eva oba-san's saying......?`
`"Ridiculous.`
` After all, detective novels are just entertainment novels!`
` You can only think of such an indiscreet idea because you read them all the time!"`
`"That's right!!`
` Even if she tried to fake the time of death a little, all of that would be blown away in an instant once the police did their autopsy!!`
` It might been effective in the past, but do you really think that kind of trick would work in modern Japan?!`
` Are you insane?!"`
`"......You think so?`
` This morning, when Doctor Nanjo looked at the corpses, he was only able to give a vague estimate of the time of death, right?`
` It would be very easy to influence the results of the autopsy by messing around with the corpses' surroundings.`
` It's a very relative estimate with an uncertainty of several hours. `
`And, unfortunately, the police's scientific investigation will have to wait until tomorrow.`
` Measuring the correct time of death after that, even in modern Japan like you said, wouldn't be that easy, right?`
` Right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"............Examining a corpse an extremely difficult task that requires both experience and instinct...`
` I have heard that there is a very high chance of a mistaken diagnosis...`
` I imagine it is very possible for a misreading of just a few hours to occur..."`
`"...However, for an alibi, that's more than enough!`
` It's an old trick!`
` It's a trick that works well enough!`
` ......Natsuhi nee-san.`
` It's not like we want to suspect you, alright?`
` We just want you to prove your innocence so we don't have to suspect you."`
`"What is this innocence you want me to prove!!?`
` This morning, I definitely met with Father!!`
` And he told me to keep the One-winged Eagle engraved in my heart...`
`......Are you denying that he said that, too!!?`
` I will definitely not permit that!!`
` I won't permit you to deny that Father said those words!!"`
`"......Maybe Father's body won't appear somewhere?`
` Normally, a person has to be missing for seven years before they're officially dead. `
`Wouldn't that be a clever way to extend Father's nearly finished life another seven years and keep all of his wealth for yourself!"`
`"I, I can't let you get away with saying that!!`
` I can't let you get away with saying any more!!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` Although I do not have the right to wear the One-winged Eagle on my body, it is certainly engraved on my heart!!`
` What do you think you're saying to the wife of Krauss, successor to the head, and the person who will act as such in his place!!!"`
`"What's this?`
` Are you going to shoot me with that gun?`
` Go ahead.`
` And if you shoot?!`
` You're just desperate because you can't think of a way out, right?!`
` Do it, just try to obscure the truth with violence...!!"`
`"Y......, you!!!!"`
`It wasn't like Natsuhi oba-san had been actually holding that gun at the ready and threatening anyone.`
` But after she was told to by Eva oba-san, she did hold it at the ready!`
`...Unsurprisingly, once things got to this stage, Jessica and Genji-san tried to stop her.`
`"...Madam, please, calm yourself......!"`
`"Mom, you aren't lying!`
` So there's no reason for you to listen to this!!"`
`"......Calm down, Natsuhi-san.`
` Wouldn't everything be fine it you just swear that Father was definitely in that room?`
` Why are you getting so distracted over that...?"`
`"...Th, ...that's right.`
` Natsuhi-san isn't lying.`
` Isn't that the end of it...?"`
`"Then I want you to explain.`
` How did Father manage to disappear from the room?`
` ...The window was closed tight from the inside.`
` The same was true for the door, right? `
`......This morning, if you really met with Father,`
` ...then you must explain how Father disappeared from this 'unopened door' closed room scenario.`
` If you don't, that would mean that you are lying after all, right?"`
`"How far do you plan to mock me......!!!?"`
`"If you want to argue back, go ahead!!`
` That's right, try explaining it right here, right now.`
` After that, I can apologize to you for doubting you.`
` How did Father manage to get out from that closed room!!?"`
`"I can't explain that so it's unnecessary!!"`
`"Really?`
` Then let me explain it.`
` We'll take the best parts from my perspective and yours, and come up with a more friendly explanation!`
` ......I'll believe that, like you said, Father was still in his room this morning.`
` However, the next time the door was opened, Father wasn't there.`
` You don't have any objections so far, right?"`
`"I have no desire to listen to anything more you have to say!!`
` Shut your frivolous mouth!!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this, alright?`
` Both times, I checked and made sure that you were the only one to go through that door.`
` And the receipt is proof of that!`
` And yet despite that, what is the answer to the puzzle of how Father was sent out of the room? `
`The window!`
` He was sent out the window.`
` ......Natsuhi nee-san, you threw Father out of the third story window of the study into the courtyard!!!"`
`"Y----, YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!"`
`"Madam, please, endure it...!!"`
`"Eva-sama..., please stop this...!!"`
`"After that, when you left and said you were going to check the doors and windows,`
` you took Father's corpse, which had fallen in the courtyard, and hid it! `
`That was probably when you took some measures to fake the time of death, right?!"`
`"......This ties in with the case regardin' Krauss nii-san and the rest, and also the case regardin' Beatrice last night!`
` There's an extremely good chance that Natsuhi-san is suspicious in those cases...`
` Normally, I wouldn't want to say this. `
`...But now that it's out in the open, there's nothin' else I can do...!`
` Please, Natsuhi nee-san!`
` Please explain how you can be innocent!!`
` Otherwise, I can't help but suspect you...!!"`
`"Why me!!?`
` Why must I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, be insulted like thiiiiiiiiiiis!!!"`
`............Hmmmm.`
` ...Looks like it's time for me to have my say.`
`"Ihihihi. `
`...It's useless. It's all useless,`
` Eva oba-san."`
`"...Wh, ...what do you mean 'useless', Battler..."`
`Jessica looked up at me, hanging on to my every word.`
` Eva oba-san's expression was composed as always.`
`"......Useless, you say? What is?`
` Battler-kun.`
` Tell me."`
`"If you only look at it from one angle, then you'd be stuck thinking that it had to be Natsuhi oba-san.`
` ...It's not like I'm defending her, but that won't be good enough for a clear checkmate.`
` I think basing the whole theory off of that receipt is passable.`
` It's not a bad thread of logic.`
` But I'd only give it a grade of 65 at best.`
` If this were an exam, that'd be bad enough to get you extra lessons in detention, right?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"...Oh my. Well, how would you break through a door sealed by a receipt, and make Father disappear? Other than by my theory?!"`
`"Eva oba-san's theory's really interesting.`
` And if you could show that there was no way to make Grandfather disappear other than yours,`
` then you would probably prove that the last person to see him, Natsuhi oba-san, had to be responsible.`
` However, since there still is a possibility that she is innocent, and that these accusations are false, you can't make that claim!!"`
`"......Hmm. Then, Battler-kun, are you saying that someone other than Natsuhi nee-san made Grandfather disappear?`
` It would be impossible for anyone else to do it.`
` My receipt proved that, right?`
` After the first time she visited that study,`
` and until the second time when we visited it together, the study was a perfect closed room, and when the seal was broken on the closed room, he was already missing!`
` If this doesn't prove that she was the culprit, what kind of trick could they have used?!"`
`"Like I said, Eva oba-san, only 65 points.`
` So, let's try 'turning the chessboard over', shall we?`
` It's not about how they managed to make Grandfather disappear from the outside.`
` Think about how Grandfather disappeared from the inside.`
` The door had the receipt stuck in it, so it couldn't have been used.`
` He also couldn't have gone through the window, because you can't lock it from the outside, and when Eva oba-san visited the study, she checked to make sure it was locked.`
` So the window also wasn't used.`
` At that point, the study really was a closed room.`
` We have to accept this!`
` However, the study didn't remain a closed room forever.`
` Once the seal created by the receipt was removed, it would also be possible for someone to escape by the door.`
`...In other words, it's not about how Natsuhi oba-san made Grandfather disappear.`
` ...We need to think about how he was able to escape!! `
`Grandfather's study isn't an ordinary study, right?`
` According to Genji-san, there's a toilet and a kitchen and even a bedroom, almost like a little house.`
` ......For example, what if he was hiding under the bed and the two of you only thought he was missing? `
`Eva oba-san, even you didn't check that far right?`
` And then the two of you went back down the stairs, thinking that he wasn't there.`
` At that time, the receipt was already gone!`
` In other words, if Grandfather was hiding in his room the whole time when it was a closed room, `
`and escaped after letting the two of you go past him, we can crack this closed room right open!!"`
`"Wh, what is this!?`
` Why would Father want to do something that weird and then escape the room?!`
` Don't be so absurd!"`
`"Yeah, it might be absurd.`
` However, it still shows that there is a possibility that Natsuhi oba-san is being accused falsely.`
` Your receipt wasn't perfect.`
` In chess, we might call that check,`
` but it isn't checkmate!! `
`And the thing that I like least is your argument,`
` pressuring Natsuhi oba-san to explain it, and then claiming that, if she doesn't, she must be guilty!`
` If you're asking me to let that slide, then why don't you let me,`
` Ushiromiya Battler turn the chessboard over one more time!! `
`Eva oba-san, according to your argument,`
` ......you must explain to us why you and Hideyoshi oji-san couldn't have killed those six last night and then casually returned to the guesthouse...! `
`You've been trying to force Natsuhi oba-san to explain.`
` I'm sure you can prove your own innocence, right?!`
` Eva oba-san, who's had all of Grandfather's wealth suddenly plopped down right into her hands!!"`
`"Th, that's right, you are suspicious enough yourself, aren't you!!?`
` If you say Mom's suspicious because she was the last person to see him,`
` then what about you, Eva oba-san, who were the last person to see Dad and the rest?!!`
` Just like Battler said, prove that you two weren't the ones that killed them!!"`
`".........Mother, I also think that your reasoning was a little overeager.`
` ......I'm sure that the receipt was an important hint. `
`But, like Battler-kun said, that's not enough to prove that Natsuhi oba-san is this culprit.`
` ......I think everyone's equally suspicious.`
` It's not right for only Natsuhi oba-san to be persecuted."`
`"O, our great Father, crawling under his bed?`
` You call nonsense like that an explanation?!"`
`"In that case, why don't you explain first!!?`
` Who killed those six, and how, and then try showing us proof that you weren't involved!! `
`......*cough*, `
`*cough* *cough* *cough*, `
`*cough*, `
`*cough*!!!`
` Uu-, *kofkofkof*!! `
`*coughCOUGH*!!`
` *kofkofkofkof*!!!"`
`"Milady..., Milady...!!"`
`Jessica suddenly started coughing.`
` At first I thought that she was just choking after yelling too loud, but before long, I realized how painful it looked...`
` Jessica kept coughing and choking, down on her hands and knees...`
`"Jessica..., get a hold of yourself...!!`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...Jessica-san, your inhaler, quickly.`
` ......No wait, I have one with me."`
`Doctor Nanjo pulled a bronchodilator inhaler from his own bag, which was lying on the sofa, and handed it to Jessica.`
`......Come to think of it, six years ago, didn't Jessica sometimes break into violent coughing and have to use that...? `
`However, six years ago, I had never seen Jessica look like she was in this much pain.`
`"......Aniki, was Jessica's asthma always this bad...?"`
`"It's gotten a lot worse these last few years...`
` It's no problem when she's normal, but...`
` when an attack comes suddenly, she can't stop coughing anymore."`
`"*cough* *cough*!!`
` Uu-, ga-*COUGH* *coughcough*!!`
` *kofkof*, *kofkof*!!"`
`"......Milady, your medicine.`
` .........Here..."`
`"...............Nnn, `
`...`
`......*coughcough*!!"`
`Taking the inhaler from Kanon-kun, Jessica used it with a practiced hand.`
`...It looked like her throat would still itch for a while, but she had it under control...`
`"Are you alright, Jessica...?`
` You scared me..."`
`"......It's no big deal.`
` ...Don't worry about it..."`
`Beads of sweat covered Jessica's whole body and she couldn't hide her rough breathing, but it looked like her sudden attack had calmed down for now...`
` This disturbance had made the dangerous atmosphere up until now seem slightly unfocused.`
` But that was fine.`
`......That kind of battle of mutual suspicion was completely unnecessary.`
` When you think about it, even finding alibis for each other and looking for the culprit was probably unnecessary.`
` After all, we're just powerless, ordinary people,`
` and when the police come tomorrow, they'll definitely employ cutting edge techniques and investigate the case thoroughly,`
` solving all of the riddles and arresting the culprit...`
`"............I wonder if Battler-kun is right after all.`
`...Just like Natsuhi nee-san is suspicious, I can't ignore the fact that I am suspicious too.`
` Arguing about that now will surely be unproductive.`
` ...Everything will be fine if we just leave it to the police tomorrow.`
`.........But don't you want to know too, Battler-kun?`
` Who the culprit is?`
` ...Don't you want to let them know the pain you feel from losing someone precious to you, as soon as possible?"`
`".........I won't deny that.`
` Even one day would be too long to let the wonderful bastard who's behind this go.`
`...But that doesn't mean that I want to doubt one of the 18.`
` Even though I said what I said earlier, I don't even want to doubt you, Eva oba-san.`
` ...To me, you are an awesome aunt who's always fun, if a little playful.`
`......I don't want to trade insults with an aunt like that.`
` I wouldn't want to do that with anyone here.`
` .........Right?`
` Everyone?"`
`"...............I feel the same way as Battler-kun.`
` ...It's pointless to trade insults.`
` ......It's probably just the stress built up because so many people have been crammed in one place since morning."`
`"......Probably.`
` It is only natural...`
` It may not be my place to say it, but I think we should all relax as much as possible..."`
`"............Eva.`
` I also think we should cool our heads.`
` ...The receipt is certainly an important clue in searchin' for Father's whereabouts.`
` We should tell the police about it when they come..."`
`"...That's right.`
` ...Right.`
` I just felt a little triumphant when I figured out that part with the receipt. `
`......Of course it isn't fair to only doubt Natsuhi nee-san, right?`
` I'm just as suspicious.`
`......But still, Battler-kun?`
` At least the part about the receipt is real, alright?`
` ...Don't forget this.`
` And try thinking deeply about what this means, okay...?"`
`".........................................."`
`Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san stood up.`
` It looked like they planned on leaving the parlor.`
`"In the end, it's pointless for us to continue playing detectives.`
` After all, `
`the police will reveal everything in the end anyway."`
`.........That's right.`
` Even if we don't play this detective game, the typhoon will pass,`
` ...and when those lively seagulls return to the harbor, everything will settle itself.`
` That's right.`
` If you think about it, this kind of crime is completely trivial.`
`......It will definitely be resolved,`
`even if we do nothing, `
`when the seagulls cry.`
`"...Natsuhi nee-san, I'll take it that you don't want to see my face anymore?`
` I feel the same.`
` ...If I remember correctly, yesterday, you had some rooms prepared for us in the mansion so that we wouldn't need to go back to the guesthouse, right? `
`There should be a bath and a toilet there, as well as a lock and a chain to secure the door.`
` There's even a bed to lie on, and my husband will be able to watch TV without having to fight with Maria-chan over which channel to watch, okay?"`
`"...........................`
`......Do whatever you want.`
` ...But make sure to be cautious."`
`"Thank you, Nee-san.`
` ...And mind your own business.`
` I'll be counting on you to keep an eye on everyone, alright?`
` Because the culprit is definitely here. `
`...And Nee-san, make sure you don't forget to keep an eye on yourself, too."`
`".........Haven't you made enough parting remarks?"`
`"...Yes, that's enough.`
` .........See you, Natsuhi nee-san.`
` ......Genji-san, we'll call for you when it's dinnertime.`
` Until then, we'll lock ourselves in with the chain."`
`"....................."`
`"......Genji, Kanon.`
` Escort them to the guest room."`
`"We'll be fine.`
` I hate shady escorts.`
` In fact, I would be more comfortable if nobody left this room until we reach ours.`
` .........Let's go, George."`
`"............I'll stay here with everyone."`
`"George...!`
` The culprit is in this room.`
` Do you plan on staying in a place like that...?!"`
`"......Leaving this room would be the same as suspecting one of my relatives.`
` ...I, ......can't believe that anyone in our family is capable of something that horrible."`
`"George...!`
` ......Even you're saying it...!"`
`".........George is already an adult man.`
` ...If his code tells him not to leave this room, then it's up to him.`
` Let him do what he wants..."`
`"...Father..."`
`Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san left.`
` The only voice that called after them was the sound of the rain.`
` The parlor was being buried beneath the savage atmosphere...`
` When I looked at the clock, I was surprised to find that it was already evening.`
`.........Had we really spent that much time worrying about needless things, talking with each other, fighting with each other...? `
`Feeling bored, I started clawing at my head when`
`......Maria and I made eye contact.`
` Since I had thought she was completely immersed in the TV, I was a little surprised.`
`"......I believe it now."`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"The letter, the murders, everything. It was all Beatrice.`
` ...No, actually I was hoping that someone would come out and say that was true.`
` .........I want it to be the work of a 19th person.`
` Otherwise, the 18 of us will have to keep on doubting each other...`
`...I think believing in a 19th person is better than that..."`
`".................."`
`"...Bringing Grandfather outside without opening the doors or windows must be a piece of cake for Beatrice, right...?"`
`Maria, after taking a single, short breath, hung her head, ...and then raised her face again.`
`"............That's right.`
` Kihihihihihihihi, locking a door is useless against a witch.`
` ......Beatrice is familiar with all 72 demons.`
` The 33rd ranked, Gaap, gives the power to instantly carry the desired person to any location. `
`...To her, taking a person out of any closed room isn't hard at all, you see?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Witches sure are incredible.`
` ......Tell her, if she feels like committing another crime, to do it in a way that no human could, `
`......and make me believe that a 19th person, `
`......no, a witch, exists."`
`"...............Kihihi.`
` ......Alright.`
` If I meet her, I'll tell her."`
`Crap...`
` Nothing's made sense to me for a while now...`
` Just when I want to believe in a 19th person, I deny it, and just when I want to believe that there are only 18 people, I deny that too.`
` Even though I wish that there were more than just the 18 people here, I couldn't accept the existence of that 19th person.`
`......In short, even though there are more than 18 people, there are less than 19 people.`
`......The number of people in this mansion is 19>X>18.`
` So the number of people can't be represented by an integer.`
`......However, it's impossible for there to be anything after the decimal point.`
` You shouldn't be able to show the number of people with anything but an integer.`
`...And yet, 19>X>18.`
` How do you explain the fraction less than 1...! `
`It's no wonder.`
`...That 19th person was something that couldn't be seen.`
` That's why, since you can only write the number of people as an integer, you couldn't see that person.`
` That witch cannot be seen.`
` Because Beatrice has no body.`
` Therefore, she is invisible.`
` Is there a 19th person, or not? `
`Does the witch exist, or not? `
`19>X>18.`
`...The witch exists somewhere in that X...!`
