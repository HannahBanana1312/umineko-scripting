`"...What sort of black tea shall I prepare next?`
` Allow me to display every refined tea that ever was and ever shall be."`
`"......Dried plum black tea.`
` ......The kind at 200 yen a pack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` ...For a thousand years, I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.`
` ...I will never tire of living in this world."`
`"...............Beato.`
` You don't have to display such hostility.`
` ...I am just a wandering witch.`
` I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility. `
`...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady Bernkastel, is well attended to."`
`".........You misunderstand.`
` I am powerless.`
` Before a witch such as you, who possesses the dreadful power to kill an individual a hundred times, I am completely powerless."`
`"That a powerless Lady Witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.`
` After all, that Great Witch, Lady Lambdadelta, was dethroned by you alone."`
`"......I only won an endurance contest.`
` She simply got tired."`
`"That is not what Lady Lambdadelta said though.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady Bernkastel."`
`"......That girl has a dreadful power.`
` ............The power to kill an individual 'without fail'.`
` However, 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world.`
` No matter how many times you divide 1, you can never reach zero.`
` That girl has the power to bring the odds of failure down to 'almost exactly zero'...the power to give rise to 'almost perfect certainty'.`
` ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."`
`"However, you have the power to cause success without fail, 'as long as the odds are not zero'.`
` ......Although you say 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.`
` ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......The power to kill an individual 'endlessly'...`
`...I think you're the more terrifying one."`
`"Such jests.`
` ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.`
` This is most certainly what one would call empty praise."`
`"......Call it flattery to make up for the cost of staying here.`
` ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {c:86EF9C:Fragments}, continually running from boredom.`
` ......I simply came around because I'd heard that you'd started something interesting.`
` Have no doubts that I will choose to leave as soon as you are no longer interesting."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I, Beatrice, am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady Bernkastel as an observer.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` And so, your impression?"`
`"............Lambdadelta is terrifying because of her cruelty...however, she is a girl I can understand.`
` ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can't understand you at all.`
` That's why you're much more terrifying than her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am fickle by nature.`
` Do forgive me. `
`...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice, right, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`"......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.`
` Unlike you.`
` You, on the other hand, never let the dice fall from your hand.`
` So, whatever the roll might have been, you're never disappointed.`
` Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied 'without fail'.`
` .........In that sense, you far surpass me.`
`.........You're one I really don't want to fight with.`
` Inside of you, there's nothing but zero.`
` That's why I can't win against you with my power.`
` ...The worst compatibility.`
` ......Perhaps Lambdadelta, on the other hand, has a good compatibility against you.`
` Since she would be able to kill your 'endless'."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ......Oh yes, witches truly are the best people to drink black tea with.`
` One doesn't get bored.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Then, I'm relieved.`
` Boredom is the only poison that can kill me.`
` ......So, don't kill me, alright?`
` Lady Beatrice, Endless Witch."`
`"If such is your wish, I, Beatrice, shall show you an even better time. `
`......In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?`
` It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of black tea."`
`".................................."`
`"Just wait for a moment.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.`
` I'd really like to lend you my power but, as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad compatibility.`
` Unfortunately.`
` But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit.`
` First of all, about that girl.`
` She does have the name Beatrice, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is 'one individual woman'.`
` See what I mean? `
`In other words, she's not some human.`
` Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.`
` To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.`
` For example, this can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a game.`
` First, take a good look at the chessboard.`
` Then, learn the movements and roles of the pieces.`
` Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.`
` When you've managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.`
` After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.`
`......I am being quite generous.`
` In the past, when I had a human body, it took me a hundred years to notice even this much.`
` This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It's just like a spoon.`
` A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.`
` You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out.`
`......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison.`
`......Don't get the wrong idea. I have no intention of becoming your ally.`
` I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.`
`...You're much like someone sitting in front of the television, yelling at the people on the other side even though your voice won't reach them.`
`{a:c: `
`SO, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?}`
`I intend to enjoy this endless tale that Beato is going to weave until I tire of it.`
` But that alone won't hold my interest.`
`......That's why I'll lend you my power.`
` It's all so that I don't get tired of this.`
` I am the cruelest witch in the world.`
` Whoever the opponent may be, I'll certainly make them surrender.`
`...Even if it's Beatrice, the Endless Witch, alright...? `
`You are my game piece.`
` Give it your best shot.`
` I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.`
` Don't bore me, okay......?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*.......`
