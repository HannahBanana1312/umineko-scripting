`"Hey, everyone, good job finishing 'Umineko no Naku Koro ni'!`
` Man, I still didn't have a clue what was going on when the story ended!"`
`"So just what happened?`
` Was that basically the 'bad ending', where time runs out before the culprit can be exposed?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Definitely a bad ending.`
` Uu-."`
`"That's right.`
` Beatrice's letter, which Maria-chan read on the first day, did tell us in advance to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` We were all so busy trying to protect ourselves and look for the culprit that we didn't even take a shot at it."`
`".........That's right.`
` If we had actually tried to solve the riddle, I'm sure things would have ended differently."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` Shannon-chan, you did a good job too! `
`You don't have to be our waitress and serve tea.`
` After all, this is a wrap party.`
` As a group of people who met a horrible fate, let's all get along and lick each other's wou~~nds!`
` Licklickli~ck!!"`
`"Speaking of a horrible fate, Shannon beats the rest of us hands down, doesn't she?`
` She was such a beautiful character, so I thought she'd definitely survive until the very end, `
`but she was killed right in the beginning, and on top of that...what was it?`
` Half of her face was smashed, right?`
` That's the worst!"`
`"............That was my role, so, umm......there was no way around it..."`
`"...Nee-san, it's nothing for you to worry about.`
` Judging by the last epilogue, even Milady and the rest of them met an extremely tragic end."`
`"Ahahaha..., it seems so.`
` I think I remember seeing this horrible picture, kind of like my entire body had been eaten apart and dismembered."`
`"Speaking of which, don't you think Kanon's last moments were the coolest?`
` Even though he had the tables turned on him, it was a showdown with the culprit, right? `
`It's a whole bunch better than our confusing last moments, ri~ght?"`
`".........Though, in the end, I was unable to get a solid hit in."`
`"Still, ...I think that Kanon-kun's death was a big hint.`
` After all, because of that, the existence of the 19th person was made clear."`
`"That's right.`
` At that time, everyone's location was obvious.`
` So it was impossible for anyone other than some unknown 19th person to kill Kanon."`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria said it was Beatrice from the beginning, o-ver and o-ver.`
` Uu-!"`
`"......I don't wanna believe it, but that does prove the culprit was a witch calling herself Beatrice."`
`"That's right...`
` There were many strange things that happened...which a human couldn't do..."`
`"Uu-. Only a witch could do things like murdering Eva oba-san in that closed room.`
` A human couldn't do it!`
` Uu-!"`
`"............Not only is the existence of a 19th person clear, but it is also obvious that this person holds a power that humans can't even imagine."`
`"In that case, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling this person Beatrice."`
`"...We probably met at the very end.`
` ...Met with the Golden Witch."`
`"Like Maria kept saying, Beatrice exists.`
` It all went bad because no one ever believed.`
` Uu-!`
` Even one of her witch friends says that miracles won't occur if you don't believe.`
` Uu-!"`
`"That's right.`
` Beatrice-sama is generous to those who respect her."`
`"......I think that, despite the fact that horrible cases kept occurring one after the other, Maria-sama was able to avoid Beatrice-sama's menace until the end."`
`"Maria believed in Beatrice from the very beginning. `
`...But if that's the case, how do you explain why Kanon-kun and the rest were all killed? They believed in Beatrice just as much, right?"`
`"......Beatrice-sama probably had her reasons."`
`"If the song of the epitaph represented Beatrice-sama's resurrection ceremony, many sacrifices were needed.`
` ......He must simply have been designated to be one of those."`
`"...Shannon-chan, you met a horrible end...`
` At the very least, I wish your death could have been more peaceful and pretty."`
`".........Umm, well, ...it's not like it hurt... `
`Anyways,`
` right now, I'm perfectly fine, so don't worry."`
`After seeing him stroke Shannon's cheek, which had been crushed during the story, everyone laughed out loud, smiling.`
`"Well, it feels a bit weird saying this, ...but I was sure this story would be in the standard mystery genre.`
` I'm a little surprised to find out that it's fantasy. `
`After all, a western-style mansion shut away on an isolated island, in a world revolving around some inheritance...it sounds just like a mystery novel to me."`
`"......Uu-.`
` I-t's not fantasy!`
` Beatrice 'exi-sts'!`
` Uu-."`
`".........Yes, we understand.`
` Beatrice-sama does 'exist'."`
`"That's right.`
` ......Beatrice-sama does 'exist'."`
`"...I hate to admit it, but I've got no choice.`
` Because it's obvious that a 19th person, a witch, was involved...!"`
`"Many things happened that would be impossible for humans.`
` During the story, I thought of all kinds of things, trying to deny that. `
`...Now I can say it clearly.`
` Each one of them, all of them, were crimes impossible for a human.`
` ......Those crimes would be impossible to carry out unless it was the witch Beatrice using all of the power magic could provide."`
`"The culprit was a witch.`
` That point is perfectly clear.`
` Long live Beatrice.`
` Hahahahahaha."`
`"Uu-.`
` Everyone believed.`
` Maria's happy.`
` Uu-!"`
`"......Gods and witches might seem terrifying to people who are frightened of them,`
` but I think they must be affectionate to people who believe in and respect them."`
`"............I think you're right."`
`"So, this murder case game is finally over.`
` Now's the time to pull ourselves together and try hard to solve the riddle of the epitaph, just like Beatrice said, right?"`
`"Uu-!`
` I agree!`
` Beatrice will definitely be happy."`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` Everyone ignored that letter during the story."`
`"......Even though it was thrust right in front of us, we almost completely ignored it.`
` I kind of feel sorry for Beatrice-sama."`
`"I have a memo with the epitaph on it!`
` Let's all solve it, let's all solve it...!"`
`"This story probably went wrong ever since that time."`
`".........That may be so.`
` Maybe we should have tried solving the epitaph's riddle from the beginning, like Beatrice said."`
`"Well, it's a little late now.`
` Even so, let's try solving it now and see if the witch forgives us.`
` Let's go, let's try to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......It was something like, 'my beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it'..."`
`Maria put her notebook on the table, and opened to the page where the epitaph was written.`
` While everyone stared at it, they got really into it as they started guessing this and that about the riddle.`
` Surrounded by the smell of the black tea and the freshly baked vanilla cookies, they spent the time comfortably and happily......`
`"...............Wait a second, you guys."`
`But Battler spoke in a way that cut through the conversation.`
` His expression looked a little unhappy.`
` What could he not like about all of this fun?`
`"...I've been listening to you guys for a while. Why did you all stop thinking?`
` Why are you so sure that the witch was behind all of this?`
` ...Don't you realize something like that can't exist?"`
`With just those words, ...the happy atmosphere surrounding the tea party evaporated in an instant.`
` George and Jessica.`
` And Shannon and Kanon.`
` And Maria.`
`......All of them stared blankly, wondering what in the world Battler was talking about.`
` Even the foolish, arrogant Battler realized that he hadn't chosen his words well.`
`"...B, .........because,`
` isn't it clear that these crimes were impossible for a human?"`
`"Th, that's right, that's right.`
` ...None of the cases would have been possible for a human."`
`"That's true...`
` After all, wasn't it full of things that humans couldn't explain...?"`
`"...I don't understand what you're saying, Battler-sama."`
`"I..., I'm the one who doesn't have a clue what you guys are talking about! `
`Isn't it obvious that humans committed these crimes?`
` There's no way something like a witch exists, right...?"`
`"Th, ...then...`
`...what about when I was killed in the storehouse, and something horrible was done to half of my face?`
` ......If the culprit was human, how could they have accomplished it...?"`
`"...That's, `
`......well, `
`it's hard to imagine how they did something that awful. `
`But that was the rose garden storehouse, right?`
` I'm sure there were plenty of weird tools in there.`
` Let's say they used some electrical tools like a grinder or an electric saw."`
`"...............Th, `
`.........that's......, `
`...umm..."`
`"Then, Battler...`
` How do you explain Grandfather's disappearance from the closed room of his study...?`
` Even though the door was sealed, Grandfather unexpectedly disappeared, right...?"`
`"We talked about that during the story, too.`
` It's not impossible that Grandfather used some trick to fool the receipt.`
` It's also possible that he went out the window, fell down, and Natsuhi oba-san locked the window from the inside.`
` I could think of a bunch of tricks you could use without relying on magic...you see?"`
`"............Th, `
`......that makes sense, but........."`
`"In that case, Battler-kun,`
` how do you explain the way my parents were killed in the guest room?`
` The door was sealed by the lock and the chain.`
` Naturally, the window was sealed too.`
` How would you suggest a human could have killed my parents?"`
`"...Well, `
`......we did have to leave that trick alone during the story.`
` Anyways, there's at least a good chance that the culprit had the key.`
` And it was possible to look in through the crack of the door that the chain allowed. `
`......It's really painful to talk about it, but it is possible that some device was used through that crack.`
` ...Like maybe they stuck something through the crack...?`
`......Hmmmm, well, even though the chain is incredibly simple, it's a big factor in setting up the closed room...`
` .........However, there's probably some closed room trick they could have used.`
` If you bought some closed room mystery novels from the bookstore, you could probably find some trick that would fit perfectly. `
`......Anyways, I can't think of one now...but I claim that there's nothing humans can't do if they try hard enough."`
`"Isn't that argument horribly irrational...?`
` It's just ridiculous to claim that it's possible for a human to do something, even though you can't explain how..."`
`"......Why is that ridiculous?`
` Why did all of you stop thinking?`
` Even something that looks impossible has to be doable.`
` Doesn't it always work like that?"`
`"Battler, you're the one being ridiculous.`
` ......If you think a human could've done it, try explaining how.`
` You can't, can you?"`
`"And you're okay with saying the culprit is a witch just because I can't explain it?`
` With that argument, all of the unsolved crimes in the world could be resolved by saying a witch is the culprit!"`
`"......Battler, you're sidestepping the issue, and you aren't explaining anything.`
` ...We are saying 'A human can't do it.`
` Therefore the culprit is something that isn't human.`
` And that something is a witch.'`
` And yet you keep arbitrarily deciding that witches are impossible even though you can't explain anything.`
`......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi, it's almost like humanity was during the dark ages.`
` Like those fools who claimed that the heavens spun around the earth...`
` those who said that the earth couldn't be spinning, even though they couldn't explain why."`
`"............Th, ...that kind of argument kinda pisses me off.`
` So this is basically what you're trying to say.`
` ...If I can't explain how a human could do it,`
` I must accept that the culprit is a witch?"`
`"............It's not like we're forcing you.`
` We were just wondering on what basis you can say such nonsense."`
`"N, ...nonsense`
`, .........`
`......H, ...hey, have I really been saying something that weird just now?! `
`Am I the one who's crazy?!`
` You guys are really starting to freak me out!"`
`"......Battler-sama.`
` When I died in the boiler room, I was killed by a 19th person who shouldn't exist. `
`...Can you explain how a human could have done that?`
` At that time, the locations of the 18 were well known.`
` Even so, I was killed."`
`"We talked about that in the story as well, right...?!`
` Kumasawa baa-chan, for example.`
` She said that she followed right after you and headed down to the boiler room, but we can't know for sure whether that was a lie.`
` For all we know, she might have entered the boiler room with you and caught you by surprise!`
` Or maybe, when you stepped into the boiler room, you activated some kind of trap, one that might have been set up to hit you with one of those icepicks.`
` After all, the stink of Grandfather's body was coming from the incinerator.`
` That's because someone had come there before, and if they had just set up a trap, it's certainly possible that the culprit could stay away from that place and use the time of Kanon-kun's death to create an alibi...!"`
`"......You talk about a trap in the boiler room...but what kind of trap could it be?"`
`"That's right.`
` Following his death, everyone immediately ran over to the boiler room.`
` But we didn't find any kind of weird device, did we?!"`
`"......That is correct.`
` Battler-sama, what kind of trap could I have been killed with...?"`
`"Well, `
`.........I don't know that.`
` ...But anyways, they must have skillfully used some kind of trap, or maybe someone is lying..., `
`or what about this?!`
` Kanon-kun, what if the whole thing was just you playacting?!`
` Th, that's it, you were playacting!!`
` Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san were also playacting.`
` They made the closed room themselves, and were only pretending to be dead!"`
`".........Battler...`
`.........Has your head been, `
`umm, `
`...feeling alright......?"`
`"......Umm, .........should I bring some cold drinks...?"`
`"D, don't look at me with those pitying eyes...I'm not saying something that crazy, right?`
` I'm just pointing out that it would be possible if you could think of the trick, alright? `
`Look, isn't one of the fallbacks in mystery stories that the victims aren't really dead!?"`
`"Fallback...?"`
`"I, in other words,`
` when Kanon-kun was killed, we really did know for sure where the rest of us were.`
` And let's assume that Kumasawa baa-chan wasn't lying. `
`But that only holds true for the survivors.`
` ......What if the culprit pretended to be dead, placed themselves together along with the real victims to hide themselves, and then acted on their own later? Everything would be explained!"`
`"............Huh...?`
` So are you trying to say that Eva oba-san or one of the rest of them was the culprit...?`
` But didn't Doctor Nanjo confirm everyone's death as a doctor?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Doctor Nanjo checked all of the victims.`
` ...Battler-sama, for your theory to work, wouldn't Doctor Nanjo have one of the culprits too?"`
`"Uh, yeah, that's right!!`
` Once you consider that Doctor Nanjo might have been one of the culprits and faked the proclamation of death, the whole story changes...! `
`See, that's also a fallback in mystery novels, isn't it?!!"`
`"......But Doctor Nanjo was also killed, right...?"`
`"Umm, .........about that...`
`...that's right, Doctor Nanjo faked his death! `
`After all, there wasn't anyone except Doctor Nanjo who could examine corpses properly, and everyone was really confused then anyways.`
` We didn't have any spare time to check and see if he still had a pulse!`
` With this theory, any one of the dead people could have been walking around!"`
`".........I think that it would have been hard for the six of us who died in the beginning to do that... `
`......After all, the shutter was closed, ...and there was a padlock that couldn't have been opened from the inside..."`
`"That's right.`
` Mom was holding onto that key.`
` So was Mom one of the culprits too?"`
`"...Aaaaaaah, wait a sec, ..., `
`maybe it was impossible for the first six, but in the case of Aniki's parents, the door was only locked on the outside.`
` So they could have opened it from the inside...`
`...That's right, after we left the room, maybe they jumped out the window and got to the boiler room first! `
`Is, ......is that too much...?!`
` Or maybe Doctor Nanjo made a mistake when examining the corpses?! `
`Look, he said it himself, right?`
` He said that there's a very high probability of making a mistake when examining corpses!`
` If you disguised it well enough or prepared a substitute body, you could fake your own death!!`
` Let's leave the method or trick they used for later...and you see, it's not that hard to deny a 19th person existed, right?! `
`Much less a witch, right?`
` At least that much is completely impossible!!"`
`"............I don't know why you've been trying so stubbornly to say that one of us is the culprit.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi, in other words, you wants to suspect one of your relatives...?"`
`"That's not it...`
` It's just, uh, I can't easily accept that a 19th person existed...and even if one did, I think we should construct our argument from the point of view that the culprit was a human.`
` I'll only accept that it's a witch in desperation, at the very end, after everything else has been disproved.`
` There's no way witches exist, right?!`
` Why has everyone been casually accepting that the culprit was a witch?`
` I think it's great how your family love makes you hate the thought that someone close to you is a murderer.`
` But is it alright to let that fool you?!`
` Don't you want to find the detestable culprit who killed so many people?! `
`Aniki, don't you want to avenge your parents?!`
` Jessica, don't you want to avenge Kanon-kun, and Kanon-kun, don't you want to avenge Shannon-chan?!`
` Shannon-chan, you should at least want to know who it was that killed you.`
` Why has everyone totally surrendered and decided that the culprit was a witch?!`
` What's wrong with all of you?!"`
`The foolish and short-tempered Battler tried to force his ignorance on the others and yelled at them.`
`...However, everyone just looked at him pityingly, silently watching over him.`
` At that time, the wise Maria laughed and pointed out Battler's mistake.`
`"............Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...I'm shocked.`
` ......All I see is you repeating this nonsense, thinking you've figured something out, Battler. `
`......Then?`
` What's next?`
` How would a human do it?`
` Practically?`
` I imagine you'll say 'I just can't think of anything now' or 'with some kind of device.' ...Using abstract words to run away and evade the topic.`
`......What I want to know, Battler, is this.`
` Why don't you believe in Beatrice?`
` She exists, so why don't you believe?"`
`"Because she doesn't 'exist'!`
` Witches don't 'exist'!!`
` There's no way!!"`
`......It was almost like a spoiled child who just doesn't want to accept something.`
` The pitying gazes quietly closed in around Battler, but they didn't reach his stubborn heart.`
`".........Aren't you acting just like an unmanageable spoiled child?"`
`"......Battler-sama, `
`I understand your feelings, but..."`
`".........Beatrice does 'exist'."`
`"Battler-kun..., why don't you believe?`
` Even though there's so much proof."`
`"I don't accept the argument that the witch must've been behind everything just because I can't explain it.`
` Does this mean that if you don't know how a light bulb shines, then magic is the cause? `
`That's wrong, isn't it?! `
`There's nothing that can't be explained without magic!!`
` All of this about witches and magic is just abdication of thought! `
`You just surrendered and gave up because you don't understand what happened!`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`"..................Ki, hihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Well, `
`......unsurprisingly, it looks like you alone won't believe no matter what, Battler. `
`......If even a single person doesn't believe, the 'miracle' won't occur.`
` ......So, if you don't rethink your ignorant theories, the miracle, ......the magic won't be completed."`
`"Hehe...`
` No-w I see.`
` ......I finally figured it out.`
` ...So in other words, you guys want to force me to say that the witch exists, right?`
` If everyone accepts this, the lie will become 'the truth'.`
` ......Is that what this is all about?! `
`......I'm so sorry.`
` I'm so sorry I keep going on about this, but what you're doing is all useless. I refuse.`
`......You guys are all pressing me, and that's why it's all useless."`
`"...............Why?"`
`"Sorry, but why don't you let me turn the chessboard over one last time...?`
` If you want to force me to accept that there's a witch, there's a really easy way.`
` ......And it's not the indirect way of saying 'humans can't do it so it must be a witch'!`
` All you have to do is show me that a witch did it with magic.`
` Furthermore, what Maria said earlier is what will really dig her grave.`
` ......You said that if even one person doesn't believe, a 'miracle' won't occur.`
` But real miracles happen whether people believe in them or not!`
` Even if I alone don't believe!!`
` So any miracles or magic or witches that exist only because I believe in them are downright lies!!"`
`"..........................."`
`The uneasy mood following Battler's ignorant rant...`
` was blown away by a very soft and light laugh.`
` Whose laugh...?`
` Battler was surprised. He had never heard that voice before.`
` When he looked at George and Jessica, at Shannon and Kanon and Maria, he noticed that they had suddenly gone respectfully silent.`
`"............Beatrice."`
`".........Wonderful.`
` ...I haven't been able to meet such a charming human for quite some time."`
`"Wh, `
`..................Who, `
`.........are you...?"`
`"......Don't you even know the host of the tea party you were invited to? `
`......Simply wonderful.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...This is the Golden Witch who has lived for a thousand years, Beatrice-sama."`
`"I am honored to see you, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"......Please forgive Battler-kun's ranting."`
`"Th, this guy's just stubborn, and, umm, he still doesn't understand the situation he's in......!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` How very wonderful.`
` ......After a thousand years, most witches get tired of living.`
` How nice it is to meet a man with backbone such as yourself every once in a while."`
`"............It is quite an honor to be present when Beatrice shows herself, Battler."`
`"......Heh, `
`.........heh-heh-heh-heh!!`
` How, `
`......astonishing.`
` ...Are you really that desperate to make me believe that a witch, `
`...that a 19th person is the culprit...? `
`This is starting to get interesting...!`
` And it's all useless...!!`
` You must be the illusion that they all claim is the witch Beatrice.`
`.........So, if everyone believes you exist, you will finally be allowed to exist.`
` ...You have that kind of a half-existence, right?`
` That's why you want to make me believe too.`
` You can't exist because I alone don't believe in you.`
`.........Isn't that right?!"`
`".........Your power of understanding isn't bad for a mediocre person who knows nothing of magic.`
` .........I see, it seems that you were born with a strong magic-resisting power. `
`......The natural enemy of us witches.`
` ...No matter how much we turn your world upside down,`
`you never believe in us.`
` Therefore, the magic won't succeed.`
`...I accept that attitude of yours.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"I've got no clue what you're saying, ihihi!`
` It's very kind of you to go to all of the trouble of showing yourself to us,`
` but I don't believe you exist in the slightest.`
` It's true that many strange things happened during those two days.`
` Like Maria said earlier, even though I think that all of the tricks could be explained, I still can't lay out the practical details of each one.`
` However, that doesn't mean that I'll surrender.`
` I'm different from the rest of them, you see?`
` I'll never argue that it was the work of a witch just because I can't explain it."`
`"This keeps getting more interesting.`
` Making you surrender will be worth my time...`
`......You're just the kind of man I'd like to force into praising my name...... `
`I'd love to try making a man like you kiss my toes.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If you want to talk nonsense, talk all you want...!`
` I deny you exist.`
` All of the events can be explained with 'human tricks'...!!`
` There's no room for even a speck of magic or witches!!"`
`"Wonderful!`
` ......This is the perfect form on diversion from a thousand years of boredom. `
`Then let me ask you.`
` A short while ago, you said that using the crack in the door would be sufficient to kill Eva and Hideyoshi, right...?`
` Explain how they could have been killed using some human trick."`
`"......Heh.`
` Suddenly jumping right into the toughest part, are you? `
`...Does that mean that this is the trick you're proudest of? `
`Miss Real Culprit?"`
`With a shake of her golden pipe, `
`seven colors of gentle smoke trailed out of the end.`
`...The smoke quickly obscured the surroundings,`
` ......and they were suddenly in the hallway of the mansion.`
` The door in front of them, slightly opened but secured by the chain, was...`
` That's right, it was the door to the room where Eva and Hideyoshi had been killed.`
`"......N, nice trick..."`
`"Alright.`
` Show me what you would do through this small crack, Battler."`
`"Erk, ............`
`......th, they probably had some device to shoot those 'icepicks'.`
` If they used that......"`
`"How would they reach Eva over on the bed when you can't see that far through this crack?`
` ......And how would they reach Hideyoshi, in the bathroom with the door shut...?"`
`".....................Damn, .........`
`...There's a crack...`
` There should be some way......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` If you can't think of one, allow me."`
`"......Oh?`
` How would a witch do it...?`
` C'mon, let's see your little trick..."`
`"............Battler, you're being rude to Beatrice..."`
`"How nice, how nice.`
` What a charming man.`
` ...That will make it even more fun to force him into submission."`
`"......Heh!`
` You really want to make me kiss your toes that much...!?`
` Only if I surrender!`
` But watch...I'll definitely expose this trick, and then I'll make you kiss my ass instead!"`
`"............*cackle*.`
` What a delightful man.`
` I'll remember that promise.`
` ...Weak witches kiss the behinds of demons to gain power.`
` Because there's no more humiliating oath.`
` Just being told that makes me want to humiliate you.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Paying no mind to Battler's worthless ranting, Beatrice once again shook the golden pipe.`
`......That's right, that golden pipe was her precious magic cane.`
`"Come, arise, children.`
` I am the guide of Purgatory.`
` Forgive the deadly sins and hold the seven stakes."`
`Guided by those magic words, which sounded like a command, seven stakes gathered.`
`...They were the stakes of the seven demons symbolizing the deadly sins of sinful people.`
`"Beelzebub and Asmodeus.`
` Come, forgive the sins.`
` Release the spirits of the sinners...!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`The picks of Beelzebub and Asmodeus responded to Beatrice's call.`
` The two stakes of the demons were sucked in through the crack of the door, like billiard balls struck by a cue stick.`
` Then, several scattered noises refracted through the wall, making a sound like a woodpecker.`
` And at the end, a pleasant sound could be heard.`
`......It was a small, satisfying sound, like the one heard when someone is chopping firewood and the falling ax neatly and easily slices through the wood.`
` It was the sound of the two picks burying themselves deep into Eva and Hideyoshi's foreheads.`
`"............Right down the middle.`
` Want to see...?"`
`They had definitely heard two sounds like someone's forehead being split open.`
` Battler wasn't permitted to see it, since he was on the other side of the door,`
` but those two had died again, and this second time, they lay not an inch apart from where they had lain the last time, with the exact same blood-spray as before.`
`"Y, ............you moron...`
` Th, ......that's insane......!`
` Y, you think you can just kill them like that?!!!"`
`"I can kill them.`
` ......I can kill them just like this...!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Suddenly, they were no longer in the hall, but seated at the tea party they had started from.`
`......Everyone but Battler was sitting meekly, ......but Kanon was moaning, fresh blood dangling from his mouth.`
` What a rude thing to do at a tea party.`
` Satan's stake was buried deep into Kanon's chest.`
`"...............u, `
`............gah`
`........."`
`"K, ......Kanon-kun......, `
`Kanon-kun!! `
`D, ......damn iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`Battler was the only one getting agitated.`
` George, Jessica, Shannon...everyone else was meekly hanging their heads like students being yelled at by their teacher.`
`"...Kanon was captivated by a trifling anger and tried to disturb my banquet.`
` ......Your deadly sin is being easily captivated by anger.`
` Cleanse yourself, regret, and do it over."`
`"......at`
`......rice..., `
`......sa, ma............"`
`"B, ...Beatrice-sama...`
` Please, forgive him...`
` I think Kanon-kun has repented enough......!"`
`"Wonderful.`
` I am generous to those who respect me.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Don't screw with me!!! `
`Do you think I'll accept your existence because of this cheap play?!`
` Like hell you're a thousand year old witch!`
` Your tricks aren't a thousand years old, they're just the accumulation of one hundred years of fallbacks from the mystery world! `
`There's no such thing as magic!!`
` Definitely!! `
`All of the crimes can be explained with 'human tricks'!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You would explain my thousand years with a hundred years by humans...?`
` Good, good, that's why I like you...!"`
`"............Foolish Battler...`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"......Cut it out, Battler-kun...`
` You can't..., `
`go...against the witch......"`
`"............nn, `
`.........u, `
`...............u..."`
`Shannon started moaning, holding her cheek.`
`...Maybe she had a toothache.`
` But it didn't look anything like a toothache.`
`......A slight redness spread across the cheek Shannon was holding.`
` It looked like that redness was causing Shannon unbearable pain......`
` Her fingers were pressing in against her cheek, and drops of sweat appeared all over her body...`
`"...Shannon..., `
`Shannon...!!`
` Hang in there...hang in there!"`
`"What's going on?!`
` Damn it, what the hell is that red stuff...?!"`
`It expanded rapidly, covering half of Shannon's face...`
`...Then, the stupid dunce Battler finally realized...`
`"P, please, Battler-kun...!`
` Please believe in Beatrice...!`
` I beg you...!!`
` Aaaaaaah, because you won't believe, `
`because you won't believe, aaaaaaaaaah..., `
`the magic is, `
`......the magic is dissolviiiiiiiing!!"`
`For the first time in his life, ......Battler heard that sound, like a pomegranate splitting.`
` The red spray even landed on Battler's face...`
` Poor Shannon's face had been split in half, ...and her last horrible moments in that storehouse were repeated once again.`
`"U, uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, Shannon, Shannon!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"D..., da da da, damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiit! `
`Stop it, stop it, stop it!!`
` Don't humiliate the dead, don't humiliate the deeeeeaaaaad!!"`
`"Uuuu, ......gah, .........eeeggh!!"`
`This time, the redness spread across George's entire body...`
` It was like the beautiful cloud drawn by milk when it is poured into black tea.`
` It spread out and extended across his entire body.`
`......As it did, it seemed to give George increasingly greater pain.`
` Looking at this bizarre spectacle, ......Battler was petrified as he frantically thought with his pitifully clumsy imagination...`
` about the nature of this strange death George and the rest were experiencing...`
` Eventually, ......that redness reached the nearby Jessica as well......`
` `
`.........eeh, `
`......ack, `
`............hh!!"`
`"S, stop it, stop it, stop it!!!`
` What did Aniki do,`
` what did Jessica do,`
` just STOP IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!"`
`"B, `
`......Battler......, `
`......d, `
`...don't let the witch, `
`...break your spirit......!`
` ......Deny her, `
`erase her...`
` A, ......as long as at least one person denies her, `
`she's an illusion that can't exist......!`
` Aaaaahhhh, gghhh!!"`
`"A, are you alright, Jessica?!!`
` Whaa, A, Aniki?!?!"`
`George was no longer recognizable as a human.`
`...He looked like the pile of leftover meat after the good, delicious meat has been scraped off to be cooked.`
`...The only thing that even resembled a human was the shape of his lower jaw and rib cage.`
` And it was clear that Jessica, who was covered with a steadily strengthening redness, was approaching the same fate.`
`"............Uu-.`
` ...Battler.`
` ......Quickly, believe in Beatrice... `
`.........If you don't, `
`.........everyone's magic, `
`.........will dissolve..."`
`"M, Maria, it's all over your body, too......!!!"`
`"I revive all the dead with my magic.`
` ......But as long as you don't believe, that magic will hold no true power. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` But I'm sure that a man like yourself won't surrender to something like this, right...?"`
`"B, `
`...Battler......!`
` We, `
`......didn't want to doubt our friends...`
` We refused to face reality, `
`...and gave in to the witch......!`
` But, `
`...Battler, you won't...`
`......won't, `
`......give in to the witch......!`
` Geh, `
`ggghh, `
`......gggggghhkkkkkkk!!!"`
`"Jessica, Jessicaaaaaaa, waaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAahh!!"`
`Poor Jessica met the same end.`
`...Just like George, she ended up like a butcher's leftovers.`
` George and Jessica were now so destroyed, melted and mixed up, it was impossible to tell them apart.`
`"............Battler.`
` Don't cry.`
` ...Beatrice will restore the dead over and over.`
` So there's nothing to be sad about...`
`......So, `
`............even if we die, we're still, `
`............just......, `
`fine..."`
`The redness began eating into the whole of Maria's body...`
` The foolish Battler watched and screamed.`
`"I won't forgive you, I'll never forgive you!!`
` A witch!? Magic!?`
` I'd risk my body and soul to deny you...!!`
` No matter what happens, I can't accept you!!`
` Now that you've gone so far to piss me off, I'll never forgive you!! `
`I won't forgive, I won't forgive, I definitely won't forgive you!!`
` You'll regret making me, Ushiromiya Battler, your enemy!!`
` I'll deny you no matter what!!`
` No matter how baffling things get, it can all be explained by 'humans'!!!`
` I'll erase every cell of you from this world!!!"`
`"Well said, Battler...!`
` That's the kind of thing that can divert me from my thousand years of boredom! `
`Come, explain.`
` Try explaining it all with 'human tricks'!`
` And learn how lowly humans are!!`
` Let's see if what humanity has built up in a hundred years can oppose my thousand years!!`
` That's what will make forcing you to submit so pleasant...!! `
`So tell me, Battler!`
` What about Maria's letter?`
` How the six were killed?`
` The shutter?`
` The receipt's seal?`
` The closed room with the chain?`
` Kanon in the boiler room?`
` Genji and the others in the lounge?!`
` Natsuhi's suicide?!`
` The riddle of the epitaph?!`
` The location of the hidden gold?! `
`So, Battler, why don't you show me the power of 'humans'?! `
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"OoooooOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOohh!!!"`
