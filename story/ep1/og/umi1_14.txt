`"......At any rate, we'll lock this room and leave everything as it is until the police come.`
` ......Any problems?"`
`Natsuhi proclaimed it as though she didn't care whether we agreed or not.`
`...If anyone had a right to object, it would have been George, ...but he looked as though he had shed enough tears.`
` George nodded slightly, still facing away from us, and when he stood up, everyone else agreed too.`
` The letter in the head's western-style envelope that Natsuhi had picked up still hadn't been opened.`
`...But now that we had decided to leave this room, she had decided to unseal it in the parlor, where everyone could watch.`
` As soon as we walked out into the hallway to head back to the parlor,`
` .........some of us immediately felt something out of place, ...or maybe sensed something strange.`
`"............Uu-.`
` ......Stinks?"`
`"Ah, ...did you notice it too, Maria? `
`...What is this stench, ...it smells awful..."`
`When everyone sniffed the air,`
` ...they did notice a horrible burnt smell drifting through the hallway, one that none of us had smelled until then.`
`"......I will go quickly to check the kitchen...`
` I'm sure I turned the flame off......"`
`After noticing a burnt smell, it was natural that Kumasawa, who had just been using the fire in the kitchen, suspected that her own clumsiness had caused it.`
` Kumasawa hastily dashed away.`
`"......Kanon, go with Kumasawa.`
` Do not let her be alone."`
`"Y, yes...!"`
`After nodding at Genji's order, Kanon followed after her.`
`...He wasn't running, but as he followed her, he tried to search for the cause of the smell in other directions as well.`
`"...Uu-.`
` Stinks.`
` ......Uuu--."`
`"It truly is......a stench that makes the nose wrinkle.`
` ...However, that doesn't mean we can just open a window for ventilation..."`
`Natsuhi was reluctant to open the windows in a situation where self-defense was so important.`
`"......Let us run the fan.`
` I do not believe there will be any need to open the windows."`
`"...George-aniki.`
` ......Is it okay if I talk to you?"`
`"......If it's about finding the culprit, then I have no problems."`
`It seemed that George still hadn't climbed out of the abyss of his sorrow.`
`...All that filled his chest now was the quiet flame of hatred towards the culprit who had stolen the lives of his beloved parents.`
`"...The chain for this room was set.`
` ...From what I could tell by looking at it, I'm positive that it couldn't be opened from the outside.`
` ......In other words, this was a perfect closed room."`
`".........That makes sense.`
` In the case of the rose garden storehouse, they might have sneaked the shutter's key out of the servant room,`
` or maybe they had a duplicate key. ...I can imagine many ways they could've done it. `
`.........But this chain is different.`
` Among generally used locking techniques, a chain is the simplest one to create a closed room with."`
`"Only a chain will block everyone coming from the outside as long as it isn't physically broken. `
`So does this mean that the culprit couldn't have gone in or out through the door...?"`
`"......That's interesting.`
` Just a few hours ago, I seem to remember everyone making a fuss over how to enter a room without using the door."`
`Back then, everyone had been making a fuss over how Grandfather had disappeared from his room.`
` Because of the receipt that Eva oba-san had stuck in the door on a whim, it was revealed that the door had remained sealed,`
` and since Natsuhi oba-san had been the only person to enter or exit during that time, she had been under suspicion.`
` Eva oba-san had proposed a theory about how Natsuhi oba-san might have thrown Grandfather out the window,`
` and left by the door herself.`
` But this door is much simpler.`
` It was sealed from the inside by the door chain.`
` The window had also been closed from the inside, and the bodies had been in the room.`
`......This time it really had been, without exaggeration, a true closed room.`
`...That's right.`
` If you include Grandfather's disappearance, three cases have occurred, and all three times, the door has been the point of interest.`
` The first was the shutter.`
` There was a key in the servant room, and if we assume someone knew about that, this can't really be called a closed room.`
` The next was the door sealed by the receipt.`
` However, since Natsuhi oba-san had entered the room,`
` then if Grandfather had left through the window or been thrown out, she would have been able to lock the window before escaping.`
` Or, like my theory, he could have hidden until the receipt was gone, and left the room later.`
` ......Basically, this door can be defeated with a handful of desperate tricks.`
` In that sense, you really can't call this one a closed room either.`
` And now, we have the door sealed with the door chain.`
`...Finally, we have to give up.`
` The window, the door...everything had been locked.`
` It was a perfect closed room.`
` The first hadn't been a closed room because everyone could be suspected.`
`...The second hadn't been a closed room because Natsuhi oba-san could be suspected.`
`...But this time, no one can be suspected! `
`This room was a perfect closed room because everyone had been sealed outside just as completely as everyone else because of the door chain...!`
`"......In that case, did the culprit carry out the crime without entering the room...?`
` Some method from outside the room...?"`
`"Well...`
` because of the chain, even though it can't be opened wide enough for a person to fit through, you can open it a small crack.`
` Did the culprit knock on the door to make them peer out before attacking them...?`
` Wait, ...is that naive...?"`
`"Yeah, it is.`
` .........If Eva oba-san's body had been lying right next to the door, then it might have been possible. `
`But she was on the bed in the center of the room!`
` And Hideyoshi oji-san was even in the bathroom.`
` Looking from the crack in the door, you couldn't even see them, and you couldn't reach them with your hands either.`
` ......Damn it, it's all useless. I don't have a clue!!"`
`......Something was tugging softly at my sleeve.`
` ...It was Maria.`
`"............Uu-.`
` Satisfied?"`
`"What do you mean 'satisfied'?"`
`".........Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...Battler, since you didn't want to doubt any of your relatives...you made a wish, saying that you wanted the culprit to be Beatrice, right? `
`Well, Beatrice granted that wish.`
` ...Just as you said, she 'did something that was completely impossible for a human to make you believe in the witch'. `
`............And even so, you're so selfish.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`O-uch."`
`I tapped Maria, who was laughing unpleasantly, on the head with my fist.`
`"Sure, thanks for granting it.`
` In return, let me teach you about not laughing at times like this.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` There was another mysterious scribble on the door to Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san's room.`
` Was that another magic circle?!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihi.`
` That one had a really memorable and characteristic design, so I'd hoped you'd at least know what it was. `
`O-uch."`
`"I don't know, so I'll give you all the credit.`
` Quit whining and explain."`
`".........You sure are violent, Battler.`
` I won't tell you if you're too mean, get it......? `
`O-uch! `
`Uu-......, I'll say it, I'll say it, stop hitting me.`
` .........That's the first magic circle of the moon."`
`"What does it mean?`
` What is this magic circle's benefit?!`
` What does the Hebrew writing mean?!"`
`"The words are from the Old Testament, Psalms 107 verse 16.`
` ......'For he has broken gates of brass and cuts through bars of iron'.`
` ......This magic circle has two effects.`
` First, it can open a door regardless of which method has been used to lock it."`
`"That sure is convenient magic.`
` ...So you're saying that they're trying to make it look like they're a witch because this closed room has a door that can't be opened without relying on magic...?!`
` And the other effect?!"`
`"When you are blocked in every direction, it finds an unopened door and opens it.`
` ......By using it in a difficult situation, it gives you a solution you hadn't even thought of until then.`
` To put it simply, you receive the power of observation and the power of discernment, inspiration and intuition.`
` ............Kihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Beatrice is trying to provoke you lowly humans, since she thinks there's no way you could figure out how this door was opened.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`O-uch."`
`"Alright, good work, so shut up.`
` ......Sounds great, I'll accept this challenge from the witch!"`
`"......Maria-chan.`
` ...Things like witches and demons don't exist in this world.`
` ...Someone killed Father and Mother!`
` I don't know whether that was someone I know or not.`
` But either way, it was definitely a human...!!"`
`".........Yeah, but......how?`
` How did they reach them through that crack in the door? It couldn't have been more than ten centimeters wide...!"`
`"At any rate, I can hardly stand this stench.`
` ......What in the world could it be...?!"`
`Before they even reached the kitchen, Kanon and Kumasawa, who had gone ahead, realized that the smell wasn't coming from there.`
` That was because, on their way to the kitchen, they realized that an even thicker wave of stench was rising up from the stairs leading to the basement.`
`".........The boiler room..."`
`"......I wonder if there's something wrong with the boiler again..."`
`Those stairs led to the underground boiler room.`
` The mansion's boiler was old, and in poor condition.`
` Both of them had witnessed problems with the boiler on several occasions, but they had never smelled the boiler belching out a stench like this before.`
`*slam*.`
`"Wh, what was that sound......?!"`
`The sound that they had heard from the basement had definitely been the sound of a door closing.`
`......Kumasawa tried to speak, as though asking a question, but she had already realized that the sound couldn't have been anything else.`
` Kumasawa was so surprised at that sound that her knees gave way yet again and she cowered...`
`......Because, at that very moment, no one could have been in the boiler room.`
` Just a few seconds ago, everyone had been crowded together around Eva and Hideyoshi's room!`
` So who caused the sound of a door closing just now?!`
`"........................!"`
`"Kanon-san...!!"`
`After taking a second to sort out the situation, Kanon ran down towards the basement...! `
`Since they had heard the sound of a door closing just now, and there was no trace of someone climbing the stairs, it meant that the person who had closed the door was now inside the boiler room.`
` If the boiler room had been a dead end, Kanon wouldn't have rushed in so hastily.`
`...But Kanon was a servant, so he knew.`
` There were two entrances, one that opened to the mansion and one that opened to the courtyard.`
` If he didn't chase them now, they might slip away...! `
`Kumasawa reached the same conclusion long after Kanon did.`
`...But she couldn't let him go alone...! `
`If the thing in the boiler room was the culprit,`
` ...an opponent who had easily killed six adults in the first murder,`
` then no matter how Kanon confronted them, he wouldn't be a match.`
`...Of course, with this argument, even if Kumasawa joined him, it wouldn't change anything...`
` At any rate, after a delay, Kumasawa decided that she mustn't let Kanon go alone, and she dashed down the stairs...!! `
`At that time, Kanon was already in the boiler room.`
` The boiler room's characteristic damp heat tormented him.`
`...It had always been an unpleasantly smelly and hot place.`
` And on top of that, the room was full of that horrible stench...which made Kanon feel like he was going to be sick.`
`......There was no doubt that this room was the origin.`
` In that case, Kanon should have been searching for where the smell was coming from.`
` However, Kanon kept gazing straight forward as he grabbed a hatchet from a tool shelf just off to the side of the door.`
`......He hadn't stretched out his hand because he'd wanted a hatchet.`
`...He had wanted to grab a weapon, any weapon.`
` ......Why?`
`".............................."`
`Kanon gazed into the darkness where the naked light bulb couldn't pierce.`
`......Then, he answered.`
`"..................In roulette, you bet on a number or the colors red or black, vying for a payoff.`
` However, low risk bets like black and red only offer a similarly low payoff."`
`The words coming from Kanon's mouth...were swallowed up by the darkness.`
` That darkness suddenly started to swirl, glittering...`
` It was, ......a very fantastical scene...`
` Golden sparkling butterflies that hid in the shadows all over the boiler room...`
` flapped their wings, twinkling beautifully, ...and gathered in the darkness, disappearing...`
` Kanon continued speaking, directing his words at the darkness as it swallowed the butterflies up.`
`......But as the butterflies gathered in the darkness, they.........perhaps...probably...no, they must have......laughed.`
`...But Kanon continued to speak without faltering in the slightest.`
`"...On the other hand, if you bet on something of a lower probability, you receive a payoff proportional to the risk.`
` ............The Master called succeeding despite an astronomical risk a 'miracle',`
` and called the astronomical payoff gained as a result 'magic'.`
`............I have no interest what kind of 'magic' you and the Master were seeking when you spun that roulette......`
` But you forgot something.`
` ......You forgot that roulette has a pocket that is neither black nor red."`
`Roulette has a special pocket called '0', which means that the house takes everything in certain variants of the game.`
` This means that all of the coins bet on the table will be swept up, just as though everyone has forfeit...`
`".........I set my heart on one thing.`
` ...I decided that if,`
` .........Shannon were to be killed, and I was left alive,`
` .........I would bring this roulette of yours to ruin even at the cost of my life...!"`
`"............This isn't one of the Master's rules, ...and it certainly isn't one of yours.`
` .........I made this rule myself. `
`.........I'm not furniture anymore.`
` .........I'm the zero on your roulette...!"`
`...Kanon's face was twisted with humiliation.`
`.........It was clear that his self-restraint was being ridiculed somehow.`
` Kanon's brow creased even further, ...and a furious expression that Kanon had never shown anyone appeared on his face.`
`......The hand grasping the hatchet was shaking.`
` ...His sweat became drops which slid down...`
` It was clear that the emotion causing Kanon's hand to shake was not anger alone.`
`...However, Kanon suppressed that emotion...`
`"I won't let your words lead me astray again.`
` .........This is where the Demons' Roulette ends. `
`...W, `
`......wait another thousand years in hell for your next summoner, `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`When Kanon swung the hatchet upwards and tried to dive into the darkness, the darkness definitely sneered.`
` It sneered at that courage as vulgar, lazy, futile, and meaningless.`
`......Kanon, his hatchet still held aloft,`
` .........couldn't take another step after that...`
` With a *clang*,`
` the hatchet that Kanon had been grasping fell and rolled on the floor...`
` And following that, with a pair of thuds,`
` Kanon's knees hit, ...left, then right...`
` That hand, which looked like it was trying to catch the sky now that the hatchet had been dropped, gradually lowered,`
` ......landing on his chest.`
` Then, the other hand did the same.`
`......Right there, a handle with a demon-shaped design was buried into his chest.`
` The same type of weapon that had been stabbed into Eva and Hideyoshi's foreheads...was in Kanon's chest......`
`"...............u`
`.....................ghh, `
`............"`
`Kanon was curled up in anguish, fresh blood dribbling from the corner of his mouth...`
`...It was...makeup over Kanon's white skin...`
` Around this scene, the glittering gold butterflies danced through the darkness, mesmerizing...`
` It was a beautiful, beautiful dance...a funeral march of tribute, ridicule, and contempt for single boy's self-sacrifice.`
`...Kanon had already been prepared for his own death,`
` ......but although he could do nothing but accept the death he had received, he attempted one last measure of resistance.`
`...He grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest with both hands,`
` ............and gritting his teeth with an acute, unearthly pain............,`
` ........................he pulled it out.`
` For only a moment, a bright-red spray gushed out.`
`......It made an unpleasant *bloop* sound.`
` It probably resembled the sound of Kanon's soul as it was sucked into the swamp of the dead...`
`"............Kanon-san?!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!!!`
` S, someoooooooone!!`
` Eeeeeeeeekkk!"`
`Kumasawa screamed at the incomprehensible sight in front of her.`
` Kanon was lying in a pool of blood...`
`...Kumasawa's heart was a complete mess.`
` Aah, what a horrible fate! `
`He wouldn't have been killed if I had been with him! `
`Aah, what incredible luck! `
`If I had been with him, I might have been killed too!! `
`As she screamed, her expression was filled with complete confusion, and all of the muscles of her face were pulled up, almost as though she was smiling while crying...`
` No one could have made fun of an expression such as this...!!`
`"What is it, Kumasawa?!!`
` Answer me, Kumasawa!!!"`
`The first one to dash in was Natsuhi, holding the rifle.`
` Battler and Genji dashed in after her.`
` Normally, they probably would've started discussing the origin of that violent stench filling the boiler room.`
`......But after they saw Kanon, who was lying on the ground as if he were drowning in an ocean of his own blood, the stench wasn't important any more.`
`"Kanon!`
` Answer me!!`
` ......Genji, bring Doctor Nanjo here!!"`
`Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor.`
`...Natsuhi, holding the rifle aloft, faced the darkness in the center of the boiler room and shouted!`
`"......Who is hiding over there?!!!`
` Come out quietly!!`
` If you don't come out from there, I'll shoot without mercy!!"`
`"A flashlight!`
` Oba-san, let's light them up!!"`
`Battler, thinking quickly, took a large flashlight from the tool shelf alongside the door and used its light to cut through the darkness Natsuhi was glaring into.`
` But the light only shone on mechanical-looking piping and a door.`
` The door had been left open a small crack, and it was obvious that someone had left through there in a hurry.`
`"......Natsuhi oba-san, where does that door go?!"`
`"G, Genji...!`
` Where does that door lead to?!"`
`"...The, the courtyard...!"`
`"L, like hell I'd let you get away, you damn bastaaaaaaaard!!!"`
`Battler let out a war cry as he slammed into the door.`
` Cool air from outside suddenly rushed in.`
`...There were some thin, rough stairs leading up.`
`...Battler ran up them, shouting!`
`"Wait, Battler-kun!!`
` It's dangerous to be alone!!"`
`Natsuhi was also rushing up the stairs, chasing after Battler.`
` They were in the courtyard.`
`...The courtyard of the mansion had been built strictly for lighting purposes, so it wasn't a very elegant place.`
` Because it was surrounded on all sides, the air was calm and completely undisturbed, even though they could hear the sound of strong winds.`
` There was only the gentle, sorrowful rain...`
` As he ran through the cold and scattered raindrops, dashing up the stairs into the courtyard, Battler looked in every direction.`
`......Of course, the odds of him finding a suspicious silhouette just standing around nonchalantly were pretty much zero...`
` Battler turned around, looking in all directions.`
` He turned again and again.`
` He kept spinning until he almost lost his sense of direction.`
` He prayed that he would see the culprit somewhere in this scenery...! `
`But there was no chance.`
` All he saw as he spun was more and more of the mansion's heartless walls and windows...! `
`Furthermore, there were two entrances into the mansion from the courtyard, and neither of them were locked.`
` Because the courtyard couldn't be entered from outside the mansion, the doors had been built without locks.`
`......He didn't know which one they had left through!`
` He had to give up.`
` Battler pounded the wall with his fist, swearing...`
`"......Battler-kun!!`
` You mustn't run ahead by yourself!! `
`.....................`
`.........Battler-kun......?"`
`Battler put his head against the wall, and scratched at it with his fingernails as he cried......`
`".........Damn it, ......damn it, damn it!!`
` Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san!`
` And now Kanon-kun!!!`
` You killed a full six people!!`
` And that wasn't enough, so you had to kill three more!!`
` Are you kidding me, are you fucking kidding meeeeeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san were always kind and fun as an aunt and uncle...!!`
` I just met Kanon yesterday, but I'm sure I'd have gotten along fine with him!`
` Why did you kill them?!! `
`Why, why...?!!!`
` You know, when people die, they don't come back to life again, right?!`
` They aren't gonna quickly sprout up again like bamboo shoots, you see?! `
`.........Why did you kill them?!`
` Why..., `
`why...?!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`...Battler was a boy who could understand the feelings of pain and regret in a person's heart.`
` ...So he cried.`
` With all his strength.`
` Natsuhi, who had always thought of Battler as a frank person, was a little surprised to find that he had this delicate side,`
` ...and at the same time, understood how easily hurt the heart of a young person could be, so she held him.`
`"..................It's alright.`
` ...I will definitely protect you, George-kun, Maria-chan, and Jessica.`
` .........As a mother, ...and as the representative of the Ushiromiya family...!"`
`"......WhaaaaAAAAaaaAAAAA!!`
` AaaaaaAAAAAAAAhhh!!"`
`Battler, after sobbing into Natsuhi's chest for a while,`
` wiped his tears with a bitter smile, as though he had been like that the whole time, and tried to appear as though he had cried more than enough already...`
`"Anyway, let's go back down for now.`
` ......Protecting ourselves is a higher priority than finding the culprit.`
` Tomorrow, the boat will arrive.`
` After that happens, the police will come, and everything should be brought to light.`
` .........There's no way the culprit can escape this island, no matter how much they struggle...!!"`
`"......That's right.`
` ...When the police come..."`
`When the seagulls cry, the crime will be solved.`
` But, ...for some reason, Battler felt a slight sense of uneasiness...as if the seagulls would never cry again.`
`......That couldn't be true.`
` When the typhoon passes, the lively seagulls should return to the harbor again......`
` I returned to the boiler room along with Natsuhi oba-san and told everyone weakly that we hadn't found anything.`
` Doctor Nanjo and George-aniki carried Kanon-kun to the servant room.`
` The servant room had a first aid kit and a sink, and could apparently function as a nurse's office.`
` Kumasawa-san and Jessica accompanied them.`
`...Stains from Kanon-kun's blood remained on the floor.`
` Judging by the large amount of blood lost and the ruthless shape of the weapon that had fallen carelessly to the ground, `
`......I figured that Doctor Nanjo's treatment would probably end in vain...`
` That weapon was doubtlessly the same type that had been stuck in Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san's foreheads.`
`......But wait, isn't the demononic design on the handle a little different...? `
`There seemed to be some small differences in that part.`
` Still, as far as their overall shape was concerned, the weapons were all of the same type.`
` Though it had seemed brutal, we'd left the weapons that had been stuck into Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san to preserve the crime scene.`
`...So this was the first time we were able to have a perfect view of the entire weapon.`
` As we had expected, the weapon was not bladed like a knife, but shaped like an icepick,`
` ...or rather, a thin stake.`
` And also, ...it had a spiral-shaped pattern that might have been like a drill.`
`...It looked like something that might be driven into the hearts of human sacrifices in some demonic ritual...`
` Including the handle, it was 25 centimeters long.`
` Half of that was the stake shaped part, which was stained with deep red blood.`
`......The length of the blood-stained part made it clear just how deeply it must have penetrated into Kanon-kun's chest...`
` But Natsuhi oba-san and the rest didn't even look at the weapon, and instead stood in front of the incinerator, where the horrible stench was emanating from.`
` They had probably pulled out 'that', which had been burnt up in the furnace.`
`...'It' was still smoldering and kept sending out dense waves of that awfully unpleasant smell...`
` Genji-san and Maria stared down at it.`
` Natsuhi oba-san probably couldn't stand to look directly at it.`
` ...She kept shaking her head, her back to it.`
`".....................Uu-...!"`
`...I'd thought that after everything that had happened, nothing could surprise me anymore, but, `
`......this was, `
`......, gghh...! `
`I stood there for a while, moaning, with a rising urge to vomit...`
`.........The true form `
`of that unearthly stench,`
` .........which came from the burnt insides of the incinerator, was the smell of a charred corpse......`
` The clothes, the surface of the body, and the hair were all hideously burned.`
` That grotesque corpse was in a state where not the face, nor the age, nor even the gender could be even guessed at...`
` But when I thought about it calmly, I realized that a corpse appearing at this time could only be one person.`
`.........It was Grandfather, `
`who had disappeared that morning, and whose whereabouts had been unknown.`
`".........I believe, ...it is most likely the Master."`
`"............I, ...agree.`
` .............That he would pass away in such a state......`
`.........It's heartrending..."`
`"...But, ...is there any proof that this corpse really is Grandfather...?`
` It's burnt so black, you can't even tell what sex it is..."`
`"Battler-kun, ...look at the feet."`
`Natsuhi oba-san, with her handkerchief over her mouth and her eyes averted, pointed and told me to look at the burnt corpse's feet.`
`..................?`
`"......Notice how there are six toes on each foot."`
`"Huh? `
`...............Ah, `
`......you're right........."`
`Just as Genji-san had said, there were six toes on each foot.`
` Each of the toes had been arranged so normally that I hadn't noticed...`
`"......Since the Master was born, both of his feet have had six toes.`
` ...Consequently, the Master was entrusted with the revival of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I have heard that since long ago, cases of polydactyly were common in the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...It's probably hereditary."`
`Polydactyly literally means 'many fingers'.`
` Because of a little mistake by god when the person is born, one of their toes or fingers splits into two, and the total number increases.`
` But a big deal isn't usually made of polydactyly in the world at large.`
` That's because it isn't a disease, just something people are born with.`
` So while they are still babies, at about the time they turn one year old, they can be taken to the hospital and given surgery to make them normal.`
` Even a child with polydactyly can be treated before they become aware, so they might not even remember it themselves.`
` By the way, it seems that there is a possibility for this to occur in one out of every two thousand babies,`
` so even though it's not usually seen, it isn't that rare at all.`
` Speaking of which, I think Hideyoshi oji-san mentioned something to me long ago.`
` ...Something about how even Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, possessed six fingers on one hand...`
` According to Natsuhi oba-san, among the many Ushiromiya family heads, the ones praised most for their wisdom had all possessed polydactyly.`
`......Because of that, when Grandfather was born, his relatives were all excited at the thought that he might become another wise leader.`
` And, when the leading relatives all died in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was apparently argued Grandfather should be the one to restore the family`
` because of the auspicious sign of his birth.`
` If Grandfather hadn't disliked his position as the head overly much, this sixth toe must have been pretty lucky for him.`
`......Come to think of it, I think I've heard about some country where it's believed that people with polydactyly should be treated as gods and revered...`
` This is beside the point, but it's fairly common in mystery novels for a corpse to be burned to hide whose body it is.`
`......But I guess that in Grandfather's case, just being toasted wouldn't be enough to hide the proof of his identity...`
` And, ......Grandfather's body was not simply burnt.`
`......Just like Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san, ...one of those things that had been stuck in Kanon's chest, `
`one of those 'demon's icepicks', ...was stuck into his forehead......!`
`"............The Head's Ring is not on his finger."`
`"...So everything is as the letter last night said. `
`..................Father, `
`......would probably be horribly disappointed......"`
`Natsuhi-san let her head droop and closed her eyes tightly...`
`......This room had also become a vital crime scene for us to hand over to the police.`
`......It was decided that we would leave Grandfather's corpse here and lock the room, sealing it.`
` It isn't clear when Grandfather's corpse started burning in the incinerator.`
` Since, according to Genji, the strength of the flames hadn't been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago,`
` so that stench could slowly creep out of the furnace and fill the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase.`
`......Putting aside whether he was rare or well-done,`
` Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned...even though he had started out locked away in the closed room created by his auto-lock.`
` ...There's probably no doubting this...`
` However, according to Genji-san, the boiler room is usually locked.`
`......The possibility that someone outside our group had snuck in and committed the crime was overwhelmingly high,`
` and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key.`
`...After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked.`
` But despite that, the culprit was able to strut around the mansion freely.`
` After this latest crime, can we be sure that a 19th person exists? `
`They haven't shown themselves once, and yet someone's trying to tout their existence.`
` Along with Kyrie-san's chessboard theory, I've been using this contradiction to deny the existence of a 19th person.`
`...By flipping the chessboard over once more,`
` the very fact that this crime makes it perfectly obvious that a 19th person exists...`
` means that the existence of the 19th person is even less possible.`
` As long as that 19th person doesn't show themselves in front of us...!`
`......If the culprit could get Grandfather out through the door sealed by the receipt, `
`if they could kill Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san from the other side of a door sealed by a chain, `
`......then is it possible for them to even create a fictional 19th person through strange tricks and devices...?!?! `
`If we still want to believe that the culprit is among us, `
`......then the list of suspects is very short.`
` The four of us kids, Natsuhi oba-san,`
` Genji-san, `
`Kumasawa baa-chan, `
`and Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...One of these people has to be the culprit! `
`Wait, we can't be sure of that.`
`......Just a second ago, we started doubting whether the corpse here was actually Grandfather's, right? `
`Maybe we can think of the other bodies in the same way.`
` For example, the first six all had their faces horribly smashed.`
`......Some of the bodies had kept enough of their faces for us to confirm who they were, but that old bastard, for example...`
` had lost his entire face, as though it had been peeled off...`
` We had only figured out which body was which by their clothes and surroundings...`
` Had the culprit prepared a fake body beforehand and disguised it to make it look like they'd died...when they'd actually hid somewhere after committing the crime...?`
`...It sounds ridiculous, but that doesn't mean it's an impossible trick.`
`......It's too early to give in to this 19th person, `
`......no, this witch......!`
`"Maria-chan, you mustn't stare so fixedly anymore.`
` Come on, Battler-kun too.`
` I am worried about Kanon's condition, and I don't want to stay in a place like this any longer than I have to.`
` Let's go back."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Maria hadn't gone out with everyone else, but had remained in the boiler room.`
` The thing she was staring fixedly at was probably not Grandfather's body,`
` but the 'demon's icepick' that was sticking out of his forehead.`
`...She was probably barely able to contain her enthusiasm.`
` I tapped her on the head.`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` ......What's Beatrice after?`
` Is it all of our lives...?"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihi.`
` Beatrice will revive very soon.`
` ...At that time, none shall be left alive.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihi."`
`"How can you laugh at something like that?`
` Do you think you're the only one who's safe?`
` Why don't you feel like you're in danger?`
` Why aren't you scared?!"`
`"......Beatrice promised me.`
` ...She said that she's going to take me to the Golden Land. `
`.........It's a wonderful place where you have no obligations, everyone's always together, and everyone is always nice to everyone else.`
`.........I'm looking forward to it.`
` That time will come, very soon now.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`...Just what kind of person is Maria...?`
`.........I only know what Maria was like six years ago, when she was three.`
` She had been pure and obedient...a good kid.`
` This new Maria six years later and the Maria I knew, ...didn't seem to fit together.`
`......Just who are they...Maria and the one who claims to be a 'witch'...? `
`To Maria, who obstinately believes in the witch,`
` ......this series of unsolvable crimes is proof that the witch actually exists.`
` Every time something occurs that would be difficult for a human, it becomes a little harder for the rest of us to not believe in Beatrice.`
` It must be an 'intense pleasure' for Maria to see her relatives, who once firmly denied the witch's existence,`
` start acknowledging that witch's existence one by one...`
`......Is that why she's in high spirits...?`
`".........Maria, `
`let me ask this one more time.`
` You'll probably answer the same anyway, but I'll ask just once more."`
`"Uu-...?"`
`"...Yesterday, you were given a letter in the rose garden.`
` ......Who gave it to you...?!"`
`"Uu-.`
` ...Like I said, Beatrice.`
` You still don't believe.`
` Uu-."`
`Maria only repeated what she had already said.`
`......Maria had met with the 19th person, the witch.`
` Had that really been a 19th person, or had that been one of the 18, who told her to say otherwise? `
`All that's certain is that Maria has been with the rest of us constantly, has always had an alibi, and hasn't done anything that would put her under suspicion.`
` She's simply overjoyed at being made Beatrice's messenger, and there certainly isn't a 19th person...`
`...............Supposedly.`
` That's right,`
` I wonder what's written in the letter we picked up in Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san's room...`
` Natsuhi oba-san should still have it with her...`
