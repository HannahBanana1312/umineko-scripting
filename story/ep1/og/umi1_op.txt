`"............Again.`
` ...So, you still haven't overcome your love of alcohol?"`
`The old physician let out a sigh as he removed the stethoscope.`
` Two elderly men could be seen in the dimly-lit study, which was filled with dust and a sickly-sweet stench.`
` In the corner of this room, which was much larger than what most people would call a study, `
`there was an expensive-looking bed, a man undergoing a medical examination, and the physician conducting it.`
` There was also what appeared to be a servant watching over the whole scene.`
`"The bottle is my friend.`
` It is no less of a friend than you, and it has stood by my side even longer than you have."`
`As the man who had bared his chest for the stethoscope rearranged his clothes, he spoke unapologetically.`
`"............Kinzo-san.`
` ...Your body only appears to be well thanks to the effects of the medicine.`
` However, if you continue to drink such strong spirits, the treatment will become meaningless.`
` ...Trust my judgement.`
` Refrain from drinking."`
`"I thank you, though only for the sentiment`
`, my friend.`
` .........Genji.`
` Another glass.`
` Water it down slightly.`
` That way Nanjo can save face."`
`".........Are you quite sure?"`
`After eyeing both the master who demanded the alcohol and the family doctor who forbade it, `
`Genji, the old butler, silently gave a slight nod and carried out his master's orders faithfully.`
` The family doctor, Nanjo, let out a deep sigh once again as he watched the butler busy himself alongside the liquor cabinet...`
` There was a smell filling up the room.`
`...This sweet, poisonous aroma felt as though it melted the heart, if not the soul itself.`
` It was the smell of that venomous green drink that the man couldn't bring himself to part from.`
`"......Nanjo.`
` You are my close friend, and we've known each other for quite a long time.`
` I am deeply grateful for all that you have done to keep me alive this long."`
`"I have done nothing.`
` ......After all, you never listen to my advice as your physician."`
`"Hahahaha...`
` And you never listen when I warn you about a mistaken chess move you're about to make.`
` It seems we are even."`
`"......Master."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......I wouldn't die if I ran out of your medicine, but I would if I ran out of this."`
`Disregarding Nanjo, who had his face set in a resigned expression, Kinzo took the glass that Genji was holding out to him.`
`...There are probably very few people who would associate the venomous color, which filled the glass, with an alcoholic beverage.`
`".........Nanjo.`
` Be honest with me.`
` How much time do I have left?"`
`"Well now...`
` How short must I make it to get you to stop drinking?"`
`Nanjo once again let out a sigh of resignation.`
` Then, he finally spoke to Kinzo as the latter swirled his glass.`
`".........You don't have much time."`
`"...What precisely do you mean by that?"`
`"......Let us illustrate it with the chess game here.`
` You have very nearly achieved checkmate...but you have not yet cornered my king."`
`Nanjo's gaze was directed at a side table with a massive chess set placed on top of it.`
` Judging by the positioning of the pieces, the game seemed to be entering its final stage.`
` The black rook and bishop were cutting deeply into the enemy lines.`
` The white king had already been castled and cornered, so that even an amateur could see that the match would reach its conclusion before too long.`
` Every time Nanjo came to give a medical examination, both of them would make a few moves.`
` Nanjo was hinting that Kinzo would most likely fall into his eternal sleep before this game could be concluded.`
`...These were less the words of a physician than they were the words of an old friend.`
`"............Were you a normal patient, `
`I would recommend that you write a will at this point."`
`"......And what is a will, Nanjo?`
` Handwritten instructions to the vultures on how to devour and scatter my corpse?"`
`"No, not at all.`
` ......As the word suggests, it is a way for you to record your will for later generations.`
` It is far more than just a means to divide up your inheritance."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......And apart from the division of the inheritance, what might I write of?"`
`"............Oh, there's your regrets...`
` and matters you have left unfinished.`
` Things you want to be passed down...`
`...and things you want to tell.`
` ......Anything you want."`
`"...Hmph.`
` .........Things I want to be passed down and things I want to tell?`
` Ridiculous.`
` I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have not one thing I want to tell or leave behind!!`
` I was born with nothing.`
` I will die with nothing!`
` There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children!!`
` Even if the end were to come today, even if it were to come right now!`
` I shall accept this fate of death without a trace of fear!!`
` `
` I created everything.`
` My fortune!`
` My prestige!`
` Everything!!`
` Those were built up by me, and they will be lost along with me.`
` There is nothing I wish to leave behind!!`
` Nothing!! `
`After I'm gone, I care not if it all goes to waste!`
` I desire no tomb, no coffin!!`
` Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch!`
` When I die, everything will be lost!`
` That has been part of the promise since the beginning, and that's why nothing will be left behind.`
` There is nothing I can leave behind!!"`
`After reaching a furious crescendo, Kinzo suddenly slumped over.`
`...His expression was limp and feeble, as though an evil spirit had possessed him and then left.`
`"............`
` However, I do have one regret.`
` I have nothing to leave behind, but there is one thing I cannot leave undone..."`
`".........You would do well to write it down.`
` Of course, it would be best if you could finish it before your time comes.`
` However, even if the worst happens, those who come after you will carry it to completion.`
` You must leave behind your regrets so that they can be resolved even if you are unable to do so yourself.`
` ......That is the purpose of a will."`
`When Nanjo tried to gently pat Kinzo's shoulder, the dying man flew into a sudden rage and batted away Nanjo's hand.`
`"It's useless, useless, useless!! `
`It must be done while I still live! At the moment of my death, my soul will be devoured by the demons of the contract and wiped out of existence!`
` For me, there will be no peace or another world after death!`
` That's why everything must be done before I go!!`
` That's why a will has no meaning for me!!`
` And even if I had a chance to write such a thing, `
`......if I did have such a chance!!`
`...I'd want to see it.`
` I want to see it one more time!`
` I want to see Beatrice's smiling face one last time!!`
` Oh, Beatrice, why have you resisted me for so long!?`
` I'll return everything you have given me! I am prepared to lose everything!!`
` So please, show me your smile just one more time...`
` Beatrice, I beg of you! You must be able to hear my plea...that's the kind of woman you are!`
` I beg of you, show yourself to me!!`
` You're here, aren't you?!`
` You're standing there invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you're mocking me from somewhere in this room, aren't you?!`
` Please, appear before me one more time and smile!!`
` Feel free to scold me, even snatch away my life by your own hands if you wish!!`
` I don't want to die alone like this!!`
` I cannot let myself die until I've seen your smile just one more time!!`
` Aah, Beatrice, Beatrice!!`
` I offer up this life of mine, I offer it up to you!!`
` I'm begging you, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`"Whoa...`
` Things sure move with the times...`
` I can't believe we'll be able to make the trip in just twenty minutes..."`
`I couldn't help but scratch my head and marvel at how far things have come in recent years.`
` We used to go by boat.`
` Back then, we were all forced to endure nearly half a day of swaying back and forth over the sea before we reached Niijima.`
` Things have gotten so much more convenient these days.`
` Still, I've never been on a plane this small.`
` I've flown in a huge jumbo jet before, but this will be my first experience in such a tiny one.`
`...It's going to shake, isn't it...`
` They say that smaller boats shake more, so I guess the same rule probably applies to planes.`
`...Aaah, just spare me.`
`"Haahahaha, don't worry, Battler-kun.`
` It'll shake much less than that boat did."`
`"Gyah?! ...I, is that you, George-aniki?! `
`Heheh, don't scare me like that...you just shaved three years off my life.`
` Anyway, what's shaking got to do with anything? `
`Ihihihi, you don't think I'm actually scared of the plane shaking or maybe falling out of the sky or something, ri~ght?"`
`"Oh, of course not, my mistake.`
` I see you've changed a lot since we last saw you.`
` After all, it's been six years since then.`
` You're not a kid anymore.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink.`
` I've got no interest in smoking, but I've always wanted to try some booze, heheheh!`
` Well, if you've got your dad's genes, I'll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?"`
`"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure.`
` It's pretty hard to do business in Japan without it."`
`"Ihihihi!`
` That's exactly right!`
` That's why I never miss a chance to get in some practice!"`
`"Th, that's no good, Battler-kun, you're still a minor!`
` Drinking alcohol is known to stunt the growth of minors and...`
`...um, never mind."`
`"Come on, I'm tall enough already!`
` In fact, it'd be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!"`
`I puffed my chest out proudly.`
` Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class.`
` But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I'd passed 180cm (5ft 11in).`
` I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail-order performance-enhancing drugs to thank for that.`
` Before then, I'd never dreamed that I'd shoot 10 cm above George-aniki, who'd reached his peak height early on.`
`.......Damn, I'll bet my relatives all say 'look how big you've grown, Battler-chan!' or something.`
`...It's all so embarrassing...I wish they'd just give me a break.`
` Anyway, my name, 'Battler'...`
`...well, it's pretty damn weird, don't you think? `
`I've got to wonder what my parents were thinking when they gave me that name.`
` I've never met anyone who could read it right the first time.`
` I usually get called '{c:86EF9C:Sento-kun}'.`
` Unfortunately, that's not even close.`
` My name is written {p:0:右代宮} {p:0:戦人}.`
` Can you read it?`
` The first part is my family name, 'Ushiromiya'.`
` That's a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far.`
` The problem is my own name.`
`.........{p:0:戦人} is made up of the characters for 'fight' and 'person', and it's pronounced 'Battler'.`
` Put it all together, and you've got Ushiromiya Battler.`
` Pretty crazy, right?`
` It's crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it's even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official.`
` ...Both groups are at the top of my must-kill list.`
` Anyway, this is one of my cousins.`
` His name is {p:0:右代宮} {p:0:譲治}, pronounced Ushiromiya George.`
` He's five years older than me, so he's probably turning 23 this year.`
` Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and two girls, I ended up playing with George all the time.`
` And because I've always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him 'Aniki' today.`
`"Whoo, Battler-kun, look how big you've gotten.`
` You know what they say, 'leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him'!"`
`"It must be in his blood, I suppose.`
` Rudolf wasn't that tall either until around his high school years.`
` Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late."`
`"Nah, it's nothing special.`
` A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!"`
`"Exactly!`
` Battler-kun here knows how it works!`
` Real men win or lose based on what they've got on the inside!`
` Can't ever forget to keep up your trainin' and discipline.`
` You do that, wait ve-ry alertly for the perfect moment...and strike! `
`Now, I never even imagined that I'd become the company president I am today, master of my own domain...`
` Yep, to think I've come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!"`
`This stout, plump, old guy is `
`George-aniki's dad, Hideyoshi ({p:0:秀吉}) oji-san.`
` He's the husband of Dad's older sister.`
` In other words, we're not blood-related.`
` He's nice to children, sociable all the time, and even quick to give out some spending money to us kids. Simply put, he's an awesome uncle.`
` He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai dialect, but he's actually a natural-born Kanto man.`
` Apparently, impressions are everything in the business world,`
` so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more.`
`......However, I hear that he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese.`
`...I don't really get it, but he's definitely an interesting person.`
`"If only you weren't so quick to brag about your life's story.`
` That's enough for now, I think.`
` I'm sure Battler's getting tired of it.`
` Aren't you?"`
`"Nope, not at all, hihihi!`
` Nothing wrong with that.`
` I think it's pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about.`
` I don't have anything like that at all."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I'd imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right. I can't believe that you have nothing at all to brag about."`
`"Wh, what? `
`Y, y, `
`you're joking, right!? `
`Of course nothing weird like that's ever happened to me!`
` In fact, I'd rather it did!"`
`"Ah, so you do have some stories.`
` ...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later.`
` After all, nothing of the sort ever happens to George.`
` Heheheh..."`
`This is my aunt and George-aniki's mother, Eva ({p:0:絵羽}) oba-san.`
` She's my Dad's older sister.`
` She and Hideyoshi oji-san are a pair of jokers, and they've always teased me back as far as I can remember.`
` This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small.`
`...Well, I guess the events of the last 30 seconds prove that they can still be hard to get along with.`
` Even so, George-aniki's family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine.`
`......Sheesh, that's pretty much the total opposite of my family.`
`"Battler-kun, `
`have you seen Rudolf-san?"`
`"Huh?`
` He headed off to the bathroom a while ago.`
` Is he not back yet?`
` Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead, {c:86EF9C:namunamunamu}."`
`"That's no way to talk about your own father.`
` Still, this isn't the first time he's taken so long in the bathroom."`
`"Yeah, the guy's always been that way.`
` Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump?`
` Oh, what on earth might he be doing with those?!`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Oh, you don't need to worry about that at all.`
` Since we've been together, I haven't let him do that on his own."`
`"Hihihi!`
` Oooh, I'll have to get the juicy details later!`
` Sounds like Dad's got his balls in an iron grip."`
`"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn't keep a tight grip, don't you?"`
`"No kidding.`
` You're the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard.`
` As his son, I'm more than happy to let you take over."`
`"Yes, leave it all to me.`
` After all, that's my specialty."`
`This woman is my father's wife.`
` Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie ({p:0:霧江}).`
` As you can probably tell from our conversation, she's not my real mother.`
` She's basically my stepmother.`
` My real mom died six years ago.`
` Kyrie-san is the woman Dad married afterwards.`
` It's understandable for someone my age.`
` I could never bring myself to call his new wife 'Mom'.`
` And I doubt she feels like using the word 'son' on this massive kid who's no relation to her at all.`
` We aren't little kids.`
` We know there's nothing to be gained by fighting.`
` So, we decided that we wouldn't force ourselves to pretend that we were family.`
` I've decided to act a bit more frank with her, as though she's a friendly neighbor instead.`
` It's much easier to just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable.`
` Kyrie-san has been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we've been able to get along pretty well.`
` Then, just when we were badmouthing Dad about being in the bathroom,`
` the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief.`
`"Hmm?`
` Battler."`
`"Hey, what's up, Dad? `
`...Owowowowww!`
` Don't pinch my ear, gaah!"`
`"So, you've been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven't you?`
` What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?"`
`"Owowow, owowowowow!`
` Dammit, that hurts!`
` You can stretch my ear all you want, but I'm not gonna be able to fly. That hurts!!"`
`"C'mon now.`
` Up, `
`up, `
`down, `
`down, `
`left, `
`right, `
`left, `
`right. `
`Now say 'Father, please forgive me for being so rude'."`
`"Like hell I will! Go find yourself some members-only store if you want it that much!`
` Gyaah, let goooo!!"`
`......This old bastard is my Dad.`
` I think I'm pretty tall, but Dad's about the same height.`
` It's probably no surprise that Eva oba-san started talking about Dad's blood when she saw my height.`
` By the way, my height isn't the only thing I got from him.`
` It seems having weird names runs in the family.`
` Dad's full name is written {p:0:右代宮} {p:0:留弗夫}.`
`......You can't read it, can you? `
`Come on, it's just {p:0:留弗夫}.`
` Anyway, this guy's name is pronounced 'Rudolf'.`
` Haha...he must hate Grandfather for giving him that name.`
` Still, that's no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me.`
` As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Eva oba-san snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear.`
`"Hey, Rudolf?`
` Isn't that child abuse?"`
`"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..."`
`This scene perfectly illustrated the relationship between the prankster younger brother and the older sister who could deal out punishment to him despite his size.`
`"I think that's good enough for now, Eva nee-san.`
` I'll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie-san. `
`Rudolf?`
` Make sure Kyrie-san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, alright?"`
`"You're one to talk, Aneki, abusing your little brother like that. `
`Hideyoshi nii-san, I'd like to thank you very much for picking her up.`
` If you hadn't been so generous, she'd still be unsold in the store.`
` You have my gratitude and apologies."`
`"...Hmm~?!`
` Who are you calling 'unsold'?"`
`After taking 2...3 steps back, `
`Eva oba-san unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad's nose.`
` After starting out with Tai-chi-chuan for her figure, Eva oba-san then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts.`
` After that, she went through karate, tae kwon do, capoeira, ...and what is it she's learning now, again?`
`...Well anyway, they say a woman's weapons are in her lower body, and that's literally true for Eva.`
`"Rudo~lf?`
` Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious?`
` Not so long ago, I accidently connected in a practice match and my opponent was out cold."`
`"...Sheesh, what a pain.`
` Guess I have to apologize for that strange way she walks too."`
`Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Hideyoshi oji-san.`
`"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself.`
` So, when I see you two bickerin' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.`
` It sure is nice to have a big family and siblings."`
`"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George-kun?`
` He's is already a fine adult who's about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child."`
`"Hey, have a little sympathy for the kid and all the pain and suffering he'd have to live through.`
` I'm surprised even George-kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine. `
`And what an awesome kid he is.`
` Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?"`
`"That's not how it worked.`
` It's thanks to Eva nee-san's proper rearing that George-kun became the good, gentle kid he is now.`
` Isn't that right, Nee-san."`
`"Oh, come now. Heheh, you think so...?`
` Our George still has a long way to go. `
`Ah, by the way, how's your little Ange-chan doing?`
` I heard she was vomiting?"`
`"Oh, that's right!`
` And I was hopin' to finally see her face after such a long time.`
` Is she alright?"`
`"She often catches a cold when the seasons change.`
` She's very frail...`
` I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time."`
`"I think that's a wise move.`
` Sticking her in that venomous head house wouldn't do her any good at all.`
` A child's health is always more important than an adult's convenience, don't you think?"`
`"I know of some great medicine for vomitin' colds like that!`
` When we get back home, I'll send some to you right away, so please let her use it!"`
`"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii-san.`
` I'm always in your debt..."`
`...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn't have any chance of butting in.`
` For now, I'm just happy that Eva oba-san gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear.`
`"Are we still waiting for the weather report?"`
`George-aniki pointed at the counter.`
` The 'checking weather' sign was still stuck next to the departure times for the flight we were scheduled to board.`
` According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather, `
`and it's not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that.`
`......Wait a sec, it isn't really going to shake...is it...? `
`From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy.`
`...Well, I guess it's different up where the planes fly.`
`"The weather's a bit uncertain today."`
`Eva oba-san looked at a TV in the lounge.`
` The weather forecast was being broadcast, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region.`
`"A typhoon again?`
` ......I guess it's unavoidable, with the annual family conference being held in October.`
` Couldn't he choose a better season?"`
`"I agree.`
` I've always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid-August.`
` In that case, why don't you suggest that to Father and Nii-san during the conference?"`
`"...Very funny.`
` Why don't you do it yourself?`
` Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested."`
`"No way.`
` It doesn't really bother me that much to have it in October.`
` I just suggested that you might want to propose it to them,`
` since you said you hate typhoons so much."`
`"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year.`
` You're the one who said you wanted to move it to the Obon festival, right?"`
`"Well, you said it too last year!`
` Didn't you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it during the Obon festival?!"`
`"I've never said anything like that."`
`"Oh yes, you did.`
` I certainly wouldn't forget something like that!"`
`"No, I didn't...you're the one saying that all the time!"`
`"Didn't you know?`
` Stopping a kick just a hair's breadth away is a very high-level technique."`
`"Sheesh, women your age shouldn't spread their legs like that!"`
`Dad and Eva oba-san's argument looked no different from a couple of brats quarreling...`
`"Even though they normally behave like usual parents, `
`they turn right back into kids again when they meet their siblings at these family conferences."`
`"You're the one who looks like an real adult, analyzing it all calmly.`
` ......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard.`
` I'd much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki."`
`"Like me?`
` Oh, I still have a long way to go.`
` I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more bold and sociable.`
` ...I think you've far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler-kun.`
` I'm sure you'll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult."`
`George-aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment.`
` Of course, he was just being humble.`
` Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Hideyoshi oji-san's company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel.`
` Then, right after graduating, he got into Hideyoshi oji-san's company as his father's aide, piling up a lot of real-life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work.`
` His great dream is to one day stand on his own and build up his own kingdom.`
` Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal.`
` It's no exaggeration to say that I really respect him.`
` And then there's me.`
` I'm nothing at all like Aniki.`
` I'm living my happy-go-lucky, idle high school life to the max.`
` I've got no dreams for the future! `
`I'd like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen.`
`...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can't compare at all.`
` My dad just says 'sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets'.`
` Dammit, I'm not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard.`
` I'll find my way myself!`
`..........If only willpower was all it took to become an adult.`
` Should I go on one of those self-searching journeys that are all the rage these days?`
`......Well, it's not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money...`
` `
`Right then, Hideyoshi oji-san shouted out loudly.`
` Oji-san is a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice.`
` When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Rosa oba-san, who had come late.`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa-san!`
` Maria-chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no see-!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be 'It's good to see you again'?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu-.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put it..."`
`"Rosa-san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria-chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee-san, Hideyoshi nii-san. `
`...And, `
`......oh my, Battler-kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So, are we waiting on the weather again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the 30 minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Maria-chan's gotten huge too!!`
` So, how tall are you now?"`
`"Uu-!`
` So, how tall am I now?!"`
`Maria-chan parroted Hideyoshi oji-san's question, looking up at her mother.`
` I guess she doesn't remember her own height.`
` She's probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month.`
` In just a few more years, she'll probably start looking very feminine.`
`"Umm, ...how tall were you the last time you got measured...?`
` You keep getting bigger and bigger, don't you?`
` Right?"`
`"Uu-!" `
`"I think she's grown a lot since last year.`
` Let's see, she turned nine years old this year, didn't she?"`
`"Nine years old.`
` Uu-."`
`"That's right, you're nine years old now.`
` Glad to see you're doing well too, Maria-chan! `
`Up you...`
`...nng...`
` I guess you've gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..."`
`"George-aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady.`
` Here, I'll do it...up ya go~..."`
`"......Uu-."`
`When I went to lift her up in Aniki's place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face.`
`...Ah, that's right.`
` The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old.`
` Of course she doesn't remember my face.`
`"Maria-chan, don't you remember?`
` It's Battler-kun.`
` You used to play together, remember?"`
`".........Uu-."`
`"No surprise, I guess.`
` The last time she met Battler, she was only three.`
` You don't keep memories at that age."`
`She must know everyone's face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven't had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now.`
` So, it's no surprise that this nine year old girl doesn't have any memories of me.`
` Even I can only just barely remember her being a three year old crybaby.`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii-chan.`
` Rudolf nii-san's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............The brother's son is...`
` The brother is the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu---!!"`
`She probably uses that 'uu-' sound to fill in the blanks when she can't understand a complicated explanation.`
` I guess that was a bit too confusing for her.`
`"Maria-chan.`
` This is Battler-kun.`
` He's your cousin, like me."`
`"......Like George onii-chan?`
` ...........................Battler? `
`Cousin?`
` ......Uu-."`
`"That's right.`
` You got it."`
`This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him.`
` For someone who isn't married, he's just great at dealing with kids.`
` I'm sure that he'll be an indulgent father in the future.`
`"...Battler onii-chan?"`
`Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was alright to call me that.`
`"Yep, that's me, Battler.`
` Nice to meet you, Maria!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Battler!"`
`"Maria!`
` You mustn't talk to him like that! Call him Battler onii-chan...!"`
`"That's alright, Rosa oba-san.`
` I don't sweat the small stuff.`
` Hey, Maria!`
` We're close enough that we don't need honorifics, right?!"`
`"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"That's right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`We horsed around for a while to make up for the six year gap in our friendship.`
` She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big, new friend, but things'll probably work out as we get to know each other again.`
` But I'm surprised.`
` She's just the way I remembered her being six years ago.`
` Seems that people just don't change that much after all.`
` I'm a bit happy that she's still the pure, innocent girl I remember.`
` Her name is written {p:0:真里亞}.`
`...Of course, `
`{p:0:真里亞} is pronounced 'Maria'.`
` The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool.`
` Her feelings don't usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she's thinking, but that's just how she looks on the outside.`
` On the inside, she's just a sweet, normal girl.`
` Then there's Maria's mother, Rosa oba-san.`
` She's my dad's younger sister.`
` Rosa is written {p:0:楼座}.`
` ...Here's a name that's totally not Japanese.`
` Sorry to say it, but her name's almost as ridiculous as Dad's...`
` I've got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is.`
`...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign.`
` Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with this? `
`Because of him, even us grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense.`
` It's even more annoying since Grandfather's own name is perfectly normal.`
` Anyway, there's one thing about Rosa oba-san that's a relief compared to the other family members.`
` The old bastard and Eva oba-san have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time, `
`but even though she shares their blood, Rosa oba-san isn't like that at all.`
` She has the most common sense among all the siblings.`
` Like Hideyoshi oji-san, she's a kind aunt who'll always be on the kids' side.`
`......However, possibly because she's more strict as a parent, she's not liberal with handing out spending money like Hideyoshi oji-san.`
` Alright.`
` Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane.`
` Then, as though it had waited for us all to gather, an announcement rang out through the lobby.`
`"Our apologies for the wait.`
` Boarding will now commence for flight 201 to Niijima.`
` We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line."`
`"Rosa, you still haven't gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up."`
`"Oh no...!`
` Maria, come on!"`
`"Uu-!" `
`We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway.`
` Our small plane wasn't as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane.`
` A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all.`
` Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway.`
` Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family.`
` It's like this is a reserved charter flight or something.`
` Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane.`
` Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as he did.`
`"Boarding will now commence.`
` As I call out the names on the passenger list, `
`please take your the seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row.`
` I will now begin reading the passenger list.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi-sama!"`
`"Oh, I'm first!`
` Right here!`
` ...By the way, do you have some candy, Eva?`
` I've been lookin' all over for some, but I can't find any."`
`"Ushiromiya Eva-sama."`
`"They're in the handbag.`
` I'll get one once we're inside the plane."`
`I've heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting because of variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off.`
` That's probably what they're talking about.`
`"...Hope I get a window seat!"`
`"Hahaha, don't worry.`
` There aren't any other kinds of seats."`
`As George-aniki said, there were apparently only two lines of seats.`
` So, this is what a small plane is like...`
` .........It isn't really going to shake, right....?`
`"Ushiromiya George-sama."`
`"Right here.`
` Don't worry, Battler-kun.`
` It won't shake too much."`
`"Ushiromiya Battler-sama."`
`"A, Aniki, what do you mean 'not too much'?!`
` You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you're screwed, right?!`
` We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don't we?`
` Wait, we don't?!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rudolf-sama."`
`"Come on, Battler, quit being a wuss and get in."`
`"Ow! Dad!`
` Don't push me!`
` We don't get parachutes!"`
`"Ushiromiya Kyrie-sama."`
`"Alright, stop fooling around.`
` Let's move along."`
`"Ow! Kyrie!`
` Don't push me!`
` This blockhead isn't moving!"`
`"Ushiromiya Maria-sama."`
`"Uu-!`
` Move, move!"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa-sama."`
`"Maria!`
` Be quiet."`
`"This is your pilot, Kawabata.`
` We'd like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation's flight 201 today.`
` We estimate that the flight to Niijima airport will take about 20 minutes.`
` We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence.`
` There might be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff."`
`"A, Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?!`
` In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff, right?!`
` So it's gonna shake so much we can't take them off?!`
` Dammit, you tricked me! It is going to shake after all!`
` Where are the parachutes?!`
` I knew I should've taken the boooooaaaaat!!"`
