`Shannon entered the entrance hall to the mansion with a tottering gait.`
` A mixture of exaltation and uncertainty gave her a feeling that she couldn't easily describe. It swelled up in her chest until it felt like she was about to burst.`
` After stopping for a second in front of the servant room to take a deep breath and calm her heart, she opened the door.`
` Inside, Gohda, who had been ordered to take the midnight shift at the mansion tonight, was absorbed in a crossword puzzle magazine, completely worn out.`
` He looked up for an instant to see whether one of the family had come, but when he realized that it was a fellow servant, he returned to his puzzle as if nothing had happened.`
`"......Umm,`
` ...I was told by Genji-sama to help Gohda-san and came over."`
`"Ah, really... Thanks a lot.`
` I was just about to go make the rounds and close up the mansion, but there's no way I could leave this place empty.`
` Anyway, Krauss-sama and the others' meeting looks as though it will continue for quite some time.`
` They might order some tea at any time."`
`"That's true...`
` Then, what shall we do...? Should I watch over-"`
`"In that case, Shannon-san, sorry, but would you please patrol the inside of the mansion?`
` I will stay here, awaiting the family's orders."`
`"Ye, ......yes..."`
`...Shannon was a little surprised.`
` Despite the fact that she had come here to help out as a favor, she was being forced to do the job of the person actually on duty as though it were natural.`
` Furthermore, after one-sidedly forcing that task on her, Gohda had once again gone back to his magazine and had become immersed in his crossword puzzle.`
` For the time being, as a sign of respect for her elder, Shannon bowed her head, and she left the room to patrol the mansion.`
` Because it had come fairly suddenly, the airy sensation that she had felt a little while ago had lessened a bit.`
` And she couldn't show this kind of face to Genji-sama and Kanon-kun.`
` Until her heart was able to calm down, she wanted a little time to herself, and maybe going on patrol wasn't such a bad way to do that...`
` From the dining hall, she began to hear the tumultuous voices of the family's discussion.`
` Someone was speaking at great length, and was then interrupted by someone else.`
` This second person also began to speak in a very long, drawn-out fashion, until yet another person interrupted him.`
` That kept on repeating.`
` It was as though their displeasure was seeping out through their voices.`
` She had been told to go to the guesthouse, so it would be bad if she was discovered by Krauss.`
` Thinking that, Shannon quick-footedly left from the entrance to the dining hall.`
` Then, inside the mansion controlled by darkness, she began to check that the house was all closed up, following a prearranged route.`
` She walked down the hall, checking that each window was closed.`
` On Rokkenjima, there were no humans other than the family, so in actuality, closing up wasn't that terribly meaningful of a task.`
` Until Natsuhi had scolded them that this attitude was careless, closing up had not been customary in the Ushiromiya family.`
` The metal fixtures on the completely chilled windows were freezing, and every time she went to check on them, one-by-one, it felt like the glow in her heart seemed to cool down.`
`"..................?"`
`At that time, she thought she saw something flickering across the hall.`
`......Flickering? `
`Something like that shouldn't be visible beyond the darkness of the hall...`
` At first, she thought she had made some mistake, but after a while, she killed her breathing.`
` Grasping a curtain, she fearfully gazed into the center of the hall......`
` However, other than the occasional crack of thunder brightening the hallway, she was unable to glimpse any flicker again.`
`...It must have been her imagination after all.`
` Maybe because she couldn't calm her heart, she saw something that didn't even exist.`
` Shannon resumed checking the windows...`
` However, in the back of her mind, a certain unnerving imagination was resurrected.`
`...It was that which had been passed down amongst the servants who served the Ushiromiya main family, that ghost story.`
` The mansion had different Masters of the Day and of the Night.`
` ...The master of the night Beatrice would sometimes fly around the mansion in the form of sparkling butterflies. That was the story.`
`...Come to think of it, didn't Kanon-kun once say that he had seen it with his own eyes......?`
`.........Could it possibly... really............?`
` `
`The roar of the thunder gave no answer...`
