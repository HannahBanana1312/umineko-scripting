`"So...at the tenth twilight, the journey shall end, `
`and you should reach the Golden Land.`
` You really are diligent, Maria.`
` You did a good job taking notes on all of this."`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria forgets a lot so wrote it exactly!`
` Mama told me so wrote it exactly!"`
`There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around,`
` and Beatrice's epitaph was copied onto it.`
` Thanks to that, `
`we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while walking down this beach.`
` Jessica and the rest had already tried to solve it several times, `
`and had already gotten bored with it.`
` However, `
`since this was a first for me, `
`I was so excited that I couldn't stop.`
` It really tickled my man's sense of romance!`
`"Let's start with the first line.`
` My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it.`
` Where was Grandfather's hometown again?"`
`"I heard that, before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara.`
` So, that said, anyone would want to know about the sweetfish river that flows through Odawara, right?"`
`"Because that river would be the starting place.`
` Anyone searching for the golden land would head down that and search for the key.`
` What's the name of the river in Odawara?`
` Does it have sweetfish swimming in it?"`
`"For sweetfish in Odawara, it'd be Hayakawa.`
` It's famous for its mountain stream fishing."`
`"Uu-.`
` Maria hates fi-sh."`
`"Ihihi, Maria, you'll understand when you get o~lder!`
` Licklicklick salty roasted sweetfish!`
` Yummy~!`
` Even though we just ate, I'm getting hungry again."`
`"...Umm, shall I bring you a biscuit?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry. That's not what I meant, don't mind it!"`
`Shannon-chan, since she didn't have any afternoon chores for a while, was faithfully keeping us company.`
` I would have thought that, as a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but it seemed that it wasn't so in her case.`
`...To the contrary, it seemed she was having fun joining in on the conversation with people of a similar age.`
` When I asked, I heard that she was a live-in worker.`
` So normally, the only person close in age to her was Jessica.`
` I get it, that must be pretty wearisome.`
`"Alright, so I get that the sweetfish-filled river near Odawara is Hayakawa.`
` In that case, we have to go down it!`
` Don't you find anything if you head down Hayakawa river?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ............if you follow it downstream, you'll arrive in the ocean."`
`"Of course, you'd reach the mouth of the river!`
` And then the third line of the epitaph was 'If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village.'`
` By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have been key points in transportation, and large cities tend to be built there.`
` That would be the next checkpoint."`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` That's a pretty good theory.`
` Just like you imagined, in ancient times, there was a very prosperous old city there.`
` That's where Odawara castle is."`
`"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara castle on a field trip once.`
` It really was a wonderful castle."`
`"Yes, I also went to Odawara castle.`
` Even though I live in a western-style house, it sure is true that Japanese people feel calmer with Japanese style!"`
`"Uu-.`
` To Maria, castle is bo-ring.`
` Amusement parks are better.`
` Uu-!"`
`"I see, I see. Alright, alright!`
` If we find the gold, the great Battler-sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play in it~!`
`.........Still, Odawara castle.`
` The hidden gold of Odawara castle...`
` Oho?!`
` That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?!"`
`"Hahahahaha!`
` Well, two years ago, we figured out that much.`
` The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara.`
` We figured that it was probably somewhere near Odawara castle.`
` The problem is the next line.`
` Alright, let's see where Battler's strange reasoning can take him."`
`Jessica grinned broadly.`
` It was like she was saying that, if the puzzle could be solved so easily, she would have found it long ago.`
`...Damn it,`
` I'll definitely find it and keep it all for myself!`
`"The fourth line.`
` ...In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
` .........I don't know what it means by 'the two', but anyway, the shore.`
` .........What does it mean by the shore?!`
` No, wait,`
` ...Is there any place near there with 'shore' in its name?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ......I have heard that there is a place called {c:86EF9C:Sogakishi} in Odawara."`
`"Huh?!`
` Wow, `
`you sure know a lot!`
` So~, what does that mean?`
` Shannon-chan, are you also after the gold, and trying to solve the riddle~?`
` That makes us rivals!"`
`"I, it's not like I'm interested in gold...`
` It's just that...George-sama told me about it before..."`
`"That's because we reached the same conclusion two years ago.`
` We even went to the trouble of laying out a map and looking it up!"`
`"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara.`
` We definitely found a place called Sogakishi there.`
`......However, after that, we don't know.`
` The fifth line doesn't say where the key is hidden in that place.`
` Maria-chan, could you read it for us?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ......There sleeps the `
`...key to the `
`Golden Land.`
` Uu-!`
` I could read it!"`
`"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn't ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family.`
` There are no hints as to where the key is hidden in this huge area, so this is where we give up."`
`"You're right.`
` ...And without the key, we can't advance to the next line.`
` George-aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?"`
`"Let's see...`
` I've never been there, so I don't really know, but according to the map, it's in the mountains.`
` I'm pretty sure it was at the base of Asama mountain."`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` That's a little annoying.`
` Couldn't a puzzle for the hiding place of a treasure be a little more exact?`
` Anyway, I get the feeling that Sogakishi is definitely the right place."`
`"Well, I doubt it's Sogakishi.`
` It could be talking about some house that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid that we don't know about.`
` After all, the first line mentioned his beloved hometown.`
` ...Shannon, you've fed a lot of sake to Grandfather, haven't you?`
` Hasn't he ever told you about his hometown?"`
`"...The Master almost never speaks of his past.`
` ...However, he speaks of the Great Kanto Earthquake as though it was someone else's story, `
`so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area."`
`"The Ushiromiya family may have been living in Odawara, but the branch family was not limited to that.`
` Grandfather often called himself part of a branch of the branch family, `
`the least connected to the successor."`
`"So that's what you mean!`
` The beloved hometown might not even be Odawara at all..."`
`"I've never even asked about Grandfather's hometown.`
` I doubt that I'd get an honest answer if I did."`
`"If the so-called beloved hometown isn't referring to the Ushiromiya family's roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning.`
` Of course, this doesn't remove any possibility that it was Sogakishi.`
` For example, he could have lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later."`
`"Uu-...`
` I don't get what you're talking about.`
` Uu-."`
`Maria had been completly left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom.`
`"Right, so in short, `
`if we can't decide upon the starting place for the gold's dice game, we can't even begin to play.`
`............But wait?`
` In the first five lines the thing we're searching for is a key?`
` Even without a key, we should be able to bust right through any door.`
` Can't we just throw away the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?"`
`"Ooh...`
` I hadn't thought of that.`
` Oh well, we're just wasting time anyway.`
` Let's hear the rest of Battler's reasoning!"`
`"......But in the next part it quickly becomes disturbing..."`
`Shannon-chan frowned slightly.`
` After looking back at Maria's notebook to recall what was written there,`
` ...alright, I agree.`
`"At the first twilight, you shall lift up as sacrifice the six chosen by the key...`
` It sure does get horrible quickly."`
`"At the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close.`
` Does that mean to make them break off their loving relationship?`
` Or does it mean to literally tear them apart?`
` I don't know, but either way, it's pretty disgusting."`
`"Even if we ignore the meaning of that second line, at the first twilight it's six people, `
`and at the fourth through eighth twilights it's five people,`
` so at least 11 people must become sacrifices."`
`"Uu-.`
` Sacrifices to revive Beatrice!"`
`"...I see, sacrifices to restore the witch...`
` That's what it would mean.`
` As a result, the witch will be revived at the ninth twilight......`
`...That last part is guaranteed."`
`"............At the ninth twilight, the witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive.`
` ......So everyone will die in the end."`
`"And with that, the following tenth night becomes the goal.`
` If everyone's dead, it'd be pretty hard to reach the Golden Land."`
`"...I'm not sure whether or not the traveler who holds the key would be included in the 'none shall be left to live' part."`
`"But at the end, something pretty interesting is written.`
` The lines about how, after reaching the goal,`
` the four treasures will be given by the witch.`
` One shall be all the gold.`
` The problem is the next one.`
` It says the resurrection of the souls of all the dead, right?`
` Doesn't it seem like this refers to everyone that died in the earlier lines?"`
`".........If you put it like that, the next one, the resurrection of the lost love part`
` might be referring to the pair torn apart at the second twilight."`
`"That's right.`
` And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight.`
` The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived at the ninth twilight, to sleep."`
`"If we interpret that favorably,`
` it'll be hectic with people dying and breaking up, but it will all be made well in the end.`
` The awakened witch will once again sleep, and all that will be left is plenty of left-over gold."`
`"The witch must be busy killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people."`
`"Not to mention waking up and sleeping.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Oh well, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, as soon as the witch's story is tied in, it quickly gets pretty shady."`
`"Too true. Ahahahahahaha!"`
`I laughed along with Jessica.`
` After all, a witch was just ridiculous.`
`...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in the witch, got angry.`
`"Uu-!`
` The witch is awesome!`
` She can do anything with magic!`
` Even kill.`
` Even bring back to life.`
` Even give love, even take it.`
` Can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing!`
` Uu-!`
` Uu-!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Erk, oh no...`
` My bad...it's just a joke!"`
`Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn't accept it.`
` She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands and, opening to the other pages, tried to prove that the witch existed.`
` Those pages had colored illustrations of witches drawn on them, `
`and conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches well.`
` It was not the normal sinister image of a crooked-nose hag flying around on a broom,`
` but a dreamlike person with unnatural powers that could do anything and wore a beautiful dress.`
` It was just what you would expect from an imaginative young girl.`
` Dancing in the sky, crossing a rainbow, `
`dancing around all night with a teacup and a teapot that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of it.`
` With a flourish of her staff, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down,`
` and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside.`
`......To Maria, a witch was a unique concept, an embodiment of the magical dream that so captivated her.`
` As she grew up, this was the last thing that gave richness to her dull and plain everyday life.`
` That is why Maria believed in witches.`
` She didn't want that dream to be insulted.`
` And, she didn't want the epitaph, `
`which affirmed the existence of the witch, to be insulted.`
` Because the witch Beatrice is Maria's dream...`
`"To Maria-chan, this is not something that points to the hiding place of the gold, `
`but magic to revive the witch."`
`So it was the single link between Maria and the witch.`
` Maria was very angry and clung onto George-aniki.`
` Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized.`
`...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait.`
` Maria didn't want to be easily consoled.`
` Unlike Jessica and I, who hung our heads wondering what we had done, Shannon-chan timidly opened her mouth.`
`"Umm,`
` .........Maria-sama, did you know...?`
` There is a ghost story about Beatrice that has been passed down amongst the servants."`
`"......Uu-?"`
`"A, ah, yeah, that's right!`
` Shannon, tell us about it.`
` I don't really know, but it's apparently pretty famous amongst the servants."`
`"What is this?`
` A ghost story?"`
`"Yes.`
` It seems it's a story from before we were born.`
` I also heard it from my mother."`
`"...Yes.`
` It has been passed down since the mansion was built on this island.`
` ...The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two Masters, `
`one of the Day and one of the Night."`
`The tale that Shannon told was just like a typical campfire ghost story.`
` If there was a forest with a witch living inside it,`
` ...then there's no reason the witch couldn't pay the mansion a visit.`
` At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants.`
`"When they did the rounds one last time to check supposedly closed doors, windows and locks, some of those would be open.`
` Lights that were supposed to be off were turned on,`
` and lights that were supposed to be on went out.`
` Things left lying around would disappear,`
` and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there.`
` When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and was playing pranks."`
`"Uu-!`
` See, she exists!`
` Beatrice exists!!"`
`"Yeah, she exists.`
` I remember often being unable to find my shoes before heading to school..."`
`Maria puffed out her chest with an 'uu-uu-' as though this was the final proof that the witch existed.`
` If I opened my mouth, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn't.`
`...I mean, you hear that kind of story everywhere.`
` Depending on the place, it might be blamed on a dwarf or an elf.`
` It's just that, on this island, they call it the witch.`
` Of course, you would expect that walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling.`
` It's an island devoid of people.`
` Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie.`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` Kanon-kun also saw something like that when he went patrolling one night.`
` And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that the Beatrice-sama from the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion.`
` ...It happened a long time ago,`
` but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`"......Whew.`
` That's scary..."`
`"Ah, ...but,`
` there's nothing to be afraid of, right?`
` Beatrice-sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` Therefore, don't be strangely afraid. If you respect her, she won't do anything bad."`
`"However, it would be dreadful if you didn't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that, just before I began working, `
`someone who spoke badly about Beatrice-sama fell down the stairs and quit after receiving a large injury to their back.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that Beatrice-sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"Uu-...`
` Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica...`
` Uu-..."`
`"I, I, I'm sorry!`
` I don't want her anger brought down upon me!`
` I apologize, Maria.`
` Of course, I also apologize to the witch.`
` I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama. Please forgive an outsider's nonsense."`
`"I'll apologize as well.`
` I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama.`
` .........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Don't know.`
` The witch is fickle, so she forgives when she forgives, and doesn't forgive when she doesn't forgive.`
` Uu-`
`"That's no good...`
` Maria-chan, isn't there some kind of good luck charm that could prevent Battler-kun and Jessica-chan from having Beatrice-sama's anger brought down upon them?`
` Some kind of amulet or something?"`
`By relying on Maria, who was proud at knowing the most about witches, George was able to revive her self-esteem.`
`...I was once again forced to admire his ability to comfort children.`
` Maria, seriously pondering and crossing her arms,`
` began flipping through the pages of her handbook as if there were obviously some charm capable of protecting Jessica and myself from the witch's wrath.`
` I had thought it was just a simple scribbled diary, `
`......but it turned out that there were also several pages that looked like they had come from a book on black magic.`
` In the midst of those, several of what looked like magical circles had been copied and seriously compared to each other.`
`.........In any case, it looks like that black magic hobby wasn't limited to Grandfather alone.`
` When she finally found what she was looking for, `
`she vigorously closed the notebook with a snap and threw it into her handbag. She then began fishing through that bag's contents.`
` It seemed that various jumbled up things were in there.`
` After a while, she took out various pieces of junk - although they were probably important magical items to Maria -`
` and repeatedly threw them back in, saying they were wrong.`
` It was all a little humorous, just like when Dora○mon took out the wrong tool.`
` Finally, it seemed that she had discovered what she was looking for.`
` With a face unimaginably clearer than the difficult expression she had worn until now, she stuck 'them' out to Jessica and me.`
`"Uu-!"`
`As I reached out to grab it, I noticed that it was a very cheap-looking charm.`
` It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary,`
` with a scorpion motif medal attached.`
` I mean, you often find cheap accessories that correspond to the constellations.`
` It felt like a gift that you might win in the crane game at an arcade.`
` It really looked like something like that.`
` There were two.`
` Probably one for me and one for Jessica.`
`......However, considering the odd fact that there were two of them, they looked like cheap manufactured goods,`
` and it was quite hard to think of them as magical items.`
`"You're giving these to me and Battler?"`
`"Uu-!`
` With these charms, even Beatrice is no problem!`
` Because the scorpion has the power to block magic!"`
`"Huh, really?`
` Didn't know scorpions could do that."`
`"Uu-, Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`I had inflamed Maria again because I said too much...`
` Maria took out her notebook again, and while pointing out various pages,`
` went on and on about how the scorpion had holy power, and that it had been drawn in magic-repelling magical circles since ancient times.`
`"......Ah, I've heard about that from some of the other young servants.`
` Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic repelling symbol in sorcery..."`
`"Huh, really...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` The scorpion protects against bad magic and misfortune.`
` And emerald brings peace to the heart.`
` Therefore, the effect is double!`
` Uu-!"`
`"It's true.`
` The scorpion wraps around the emerald and protects it.`
` I see, that seems very useful."`
`I really wanted to make fun of this worthless looking charm, `
`but as I watched Maria explaining the charm with all of her heart, and realized that she had prepared them out of consideration for us,`
` it felt as though, even if it were just a prize from a game center, it would still be beneficial.`
` The material quality of the charm wasn't important.`
` The strength of her feelings was.`
` Even I wouldn't plan on ruining everything by making fun of it.`
`"Okay, thank you.`
` I apologized to Beatrice-sama, but, even in the worst case where I'm cursed, I'll be safe now thanks to Maria's charm.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Ah, that's right!`
` Thank you, Maria."`
`"Uu-!`
` Wear it on your arm when you want a peaceful heart.`
` If you put it in your wallet, your money won't decrease!`
` If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can't get in!`
` It's a really convenient charm!"`
`"What an incredible effect.`
` If Maria-sama is confident in this charm and recommends it, I am sure it will be reliable."`
`As Shannon-chan clapped her hands together, Maria stuck out her chest.`
` She was completely vigorous again.`
` If it would keep her in this good of a mood, it would probably be worth it to let Maria lead the discussion for a while longer.`
` When you think about it, she hadn't shared in our excitement when we talked about the gold's hidden location, so I think she had gotten a little bored.`
` While eating the cookies Kumasawa-san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic.`
` Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions.`
` For each one, George-aniki and Shannon-chan would act surprised and agree with everything she said.`
` The color of the clouds in the sky grew progressively heavier, but the cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after one year of separation...`
`"...Nn.`
` Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?"`
`"Huh?`
` What's up?"`
`As George-aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky.`
` Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, it wouldn't have been odd for a raindrop to fall down.`
` It also seemed like the wind had gotten a little stronger.`
`"Uu-?`
` Maria didn't feel a drop.`
` Only Maria didn't.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Calm down, neither did I.`
` Anyway I'm sure that it'll rain so much tonight that everyone will get the same amount of raindrops."`
`"That's right.`
` Maybe we should head back soon...?"`
`Shannon-chan looked down at her watch.`
` It was already well into the evening.`
`"Is it already time for you to return to your work?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...For allowing me to enjoy some time together with everyone,`
` thank you very much."`
`"Tell Kumasawa-san thanks for the cookies.`
` Alright everyone, help out with the cleanup."`
`Shannon-chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant's job,`
` but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life.`
` We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up.`
`"Uu-!`
` The trash is getting awa-y!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`"I won't let it get away. I'll take it before Maria does!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` Maria will pick it up!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Maria-!`
` Don't get your shoes wet, you'll get in trouble-!"`
`To Maria, chasing after some trash that the strong winds had sent flying was just like another game.`
` When we finished cleaning up, the wind had started blowing very strongly.`
` It looked like a good chance to head back.`
`"Everyone really helped me out.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"...It really looks like you're out of time.`
` It's alright if you head back first."`
`George-aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left.`
`"Genji-san is very rigorous about time.`
` If you aren't at the right place at the right time, he can be very strict."`
`"We'll see you later.`
` Do your best with your work."`
`"Ye, yes!`
` ......Then if you will excuse me."`
`After making a respectful bow, Shannon-chan ran over towards the rose garden.`
`"Okay, let's head back to the guesthouse.`
` We can watch television or something and relax a little."`
`"Uu-!`
` Watch TV!`
` Watch TV, uu-!"`
`"Then it's decided.`
` Let's head back and everyone can watch television together."`
`Maria, who hadn't had enough fun yet, agreed when she thought about watching television.`
` We climbed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden.`
` The wind had become very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on the water.`
` This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses...`
` Tonight's typhoon was sure to ruin them...`
`"These roses might be done in by tonight's winds."`
`"You're right.`
` Don't you think the roses were lucky?`
` After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon."`
`"A flower will always lose its petals at some point.`
` However, because of that, we can admire them even more when they are in bloom."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Maria, burn this image into your eyes.`
` At this moment, they are the best roses of the year."`
`"Uu-.`
` Burned into eyes."`
`Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands.`
` It looked like she had remembered something.`
`"......Maria's rose...`
` The typhoon will send it flying.`
` ......Uu-!"`
`"Oh, you mean that unhealthy rose George-aniki marked with a ribbon?"`
`It seemed that Maria remembered where the rose was.`
` She ran at full speed.`
` The rest of us followed her.`
`"............Uu-?`
` Uu-."`
`"Where was that again...?`
` I'm sure it was somewhere around here."`
`We searched everywhere around that area, but, after all, it was only a single flower amongst all of these roses.`
` Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, we weren't able to find it.`
` The winds that made up the front lines of the typhoon were making the roses throughout the garden undulate.`
` It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria's rose impossible to find...`
`"Maybe it wasn't here...`
` Let's try spreading out a bit in our search."`
`"Sounds good.`
` Let's go for strength in numbers.`
` .........Hm?`
` What's up Maria."`
`As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face.`
`......It felt like her intention was to stop us from going to another place.`
`"What is it, what happened?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` Maria's rose is here.`
` It's here...!"`
`"But it's actually not, is it...?`
` Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed.`
` If we all look, we'll find it fast, right?"`
`"Uu-!!`
` It's here!`
` Maria's rose is here!!`
` Look for it!`
` Look--for--it!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Maria stomped her feet in irritation.`
`...She had pointed out this spot and said it was definitely here, but it actually wasn't.`
` Having said that, Maria got mad when we went to go search elsewhere.`
`...We couldn't help but be puzzled.`
` For a while, we would have to stay with Maria, `
`and pretend to search through this rose thicket.`
`"......Uu-.`
` Uu-...!`
` Not here.`
` ......Not here!`
` Not here!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Maybe she's saying that it should be here but isn't.`
` Maria became increasingly ill-tempered...`
`"...Oh man, `
`Maria is really losing her temper."`
`"Maria sometimes starts to really care about really pointless things.`
` If she gets what she wants, that's alright, but..."`
`"You can't find something that isn't there...`
` That's not good..."`
`Just when we were at a loss as to what was going on, `
`Maria raised a loud voice.`
`"Mama-!!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`In the direction she was waving her hand, Rosa oba-san's figure was visible.`
` Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came, `
`or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse.`
` Rosa oba-san was coming from the mansion.`
` She quickly noticed her daughter's voice and came over.`
`"My, my, what happened, everyone?`
` Are you looking for something?"`
`"Loook!`
` Mama, you look for Maria's rose too!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria's rose?"`
`"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it."`
`"We wrapped a candy wrapper around it.`
` ...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn't it?`
` Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must have been somewhere else.`
` Did Maria remember it wrong?"`
`"Uu-!!`
` It is here!!`
` It--is--here!!`
` Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-!!"`
`"How many times do I have to tell you to stop saying 'uu-uu-' before you will understand!`
` Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!"`
`I was a little surprised to see Rosa oba-san, who I had only ever seen as gentle, get angry.`
` Rosa oba-san began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being,`
` but we were already more than sure that it wasn't around here.`
`...Therefore, Rosa oba-san also soon realized that it wasn't here.`
`"The rose isn't here.`
` Did you mistake this place for somewhere else?`
` There are so many roses around,"`
`"Uu-!!`
` Uuuu---!!!`
` That's wrong!!`
` It is here!!`
` Mama doesn't believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Didn't I believe you and look hard for it?!`
` But it isn't here!"`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` But it is here!!`
` It is here but it isn't!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Then someone must have ripped it out!`
` Anyway, stop saying 'uu-uu'!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Who ripped out Maria's rose, who did?!?!`
` Give it back, give it back!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"How should I know!!`
` Stop it, stop saying 'uu-uu-'!!"`
`Rosa oba-san slapped Maria's left cheek with her palm.`
` In that instant, Maria was shocked into silence.`
` Of course, it was only for an instant.`
` When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected before it could be fulfilled, she started yelling with an increasingly louder voice.`
`"Uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Maria's rose!`
` Maria's rose!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Didn't I tell you to stop that weird habit!!`
` That's why all of the kids in your class make fun of you!!`
` Cut it out!!"`
`Once again, her palm slapped Maria's cheek.`
` This time she didn't go silent.`
` She choked as she started crying, and began to bawl in an increasingly louder voice...`
` Rosa oba-san was clearly irritated, and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up...`
`"Ro, Rosa oba-san...`
` Now, now...She's just a little kid. There's no reason to get so serious...ihihi."`
`I tried to cut in with a bitter smile, rubbing my hands together, `
`...but Rosa oba-san threatened me with a serious face which told me not to butt in.`
`"I'm sorry, would Battler-kun and the rest of you return to your room?`
` Oba-san needs to have a little talk with Maria."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Nobody believes in Maria's rose!!`
` Even though it was here!!`
` Uu-uu-!!`
` Look for it!!`
` Look--for--it!!`
` Here, it was here!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"But it's not here!!`
` Then did you confuse it with somewhere else?!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!`
` It is here!!`
` It is definitely here!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Then it has disappeared!!`
` Give it up!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why did it disappear?`
` Why, why?!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I don't know that!!`
` So stop saying 'uu-uu-'!! `
`Rosa oba-san once again raised her hand and, overrun by emotions, slapped Maria's cheek.`
` It was so strong, it knocked Maria over.`
`"H, hey...Rosa oba-san, `
`even if she is your daughter, you shouldn't be violent like that..."`
`I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying 'uu-uu-'.`
`......I knew that problems between parent and child were none of my business as an outsider.`
` But I wasn't brought up to just silently observe something like this...`
`"Don't you think it's weird, Battler-kun?`
` Do you have any girls at your school that mutter 'uu-uu-'?"`
`"Well, I am in high school...`
` But for an elementary schooler, I think saying 'uu-uu-' is pretty cute..."`
`"Cute?`
` Saying 'uu-uu-' is cute?`
` Cute?!"`
`It seemed that my reckless words had brought Rosa oba-san's wrath down upon me.`
` Oba-san grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression...`
`"Don't say such nonsense!!`
` Do you know how old Maria is?`
` She's nine!`
` That she's a fourth grader?!`
` That she's not a kindergartner?!`
` And even so, she still says 'uu-uu-' during class!!`
` Do you understand?!`
` This kid, do you know what they say about her when they bully her?!`
` That, thanks to that weird habit, she still hasn't made even a single friend?!`
` Don't turn your eyes from reality and recklessly call Maria cute!!`
` Think more seriously about this kid's future!!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"I told you, stop saying 'uu-uu-'!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to stop it!!"`
`Rosa oba-san struck Maria's quivering head from which an increasingly unsatisfied voice was rising.`
` I tried to stop it, but Oba-san thrust me away...`
` My back hit George-aniki.`
`"......A long time ago, Rosa-san also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria-chan's baby words...`
` but she is now midway through elementary school, and the fact that it hasn't been fixed has bothered her a lot recently..."`
`"It's not like it matters what kind of words she uses..."`
`"You can't grow up to be like that.`
` ...Therefore, even though it's not a pleasant scene to watch,`
` ......this is a problem between parent and child."`
`".........Well, `
`I also often get in trouble from my mother about how I speak."`
`If you look at it that way, maybe an outsider shouldn't interfere with this even though it's painful to watch...`
`"Battler-kun, didn't you ever have any bad habits as a kid that you couldn't fix and got you in trouble?"`
`"......Well, one or two.`
` On Parent's Day, I always got in trouble in front of everyone, and it was so embarrassing, I couldn't stand it."`
`"Well then, you can understand Maria-chan's feelings right now.`
` ......I'm sure she doesn't want us to be here now.`
` ......Do you understand as well, Jessica-chan?"`
`".........I don't think anyone likes to be seen when they're being punished."`
`"Let's go.`
` Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` Then, after Maria-chan comes back,`
` let's welcome her as if nothing happened.`
` That's probably for the best, isn't it?"`
`Because we thought that George-aniki's point was probably correct,`
` ...we were fine with using that correct-sounding reason to justify retreating as long as it would ease the pain in our chests.`
` Jessica and I nodded at George-aniki, and we all left.`
` We called towards Maria that we were going to head to the guesthouse, `
`but since it didn't seem to reach her ears, we also had shamelessly guilty consciences...`
`"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want!`
` Mama doesn't care!!"`
`"Uu-!!!`
` Look for it!`
` Maria will look for it by herself!!`
` Will look for it even if Mama doesn't care!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Have it your way!!"`
`After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion.`
` Maria probably viewed that as a cold gesture meant to injure.`
` But from Rosa's perspective, that was not her intention.`
`...It was because the hand which she had so emotionally struck Maria's cheek with was still numb.`
` It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions and continue slapping her daughter's cheek over and over.`
` After Rosa left, only Maria was left alone in the rose garden.`
` The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead.`
`...However, Maria couldn't leave that place.`
` Not until she found that poor, withering rose.`
` It had definitely been there.`
`......Even so,`
` it wasn't.`
` Even though she knew the place and even though it had been there,`
`it wasn't.`
` Maria, while bitterly staring at the place it was supposed to be, thought frantically.`
` Maybe the angle I'm looking from is wrong.`
` Maybe the height I'm looking from is wrong.`
`......While gazing at a single point, `
`Maria repeatedly stood up, changed her position and continued to stare.`
` The wind was getting increasingly stronger......`
` But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed...`
`.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window.`
` It seemed to be pouring down thickly.`
` It had begun to rain later than the weather report had predicted.`
` Kinzo, as if being summoned by the sound of the rain, approached the window.`
` The sound of the rain is a sound of silence.`
` That sound feels quieter than any silence `
`and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from when they are born to when they die.`
`"......You're late, Beatrice."`
`Were those words directed at the rainy sky...? `
`No one could be seen in the direction of Kinzo's gaze.`
`"......So, shall we start?`
` Let us begin our banquet of miracles.`
` ......Even now this island has been cut off from the world.`
` Now there is no one who can interrupt my ceremony.`
` There are many fitting sacrifices for you.`
` Four of my children.`
` Three of their companions.`
` Four of my grandchildren.`
` Me and my guests and my servants!`
` You may eat up as many as you please.`
` The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons' Roulette.`
` If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice.`
` ...However, because of that...`
` because I will bet on that madness,`
`......I will definitely create a grand miracle.`
`...Come, devour as much as you wish...!!`
` I will overcome that roulette.`
` Yes, I'll put everything on the line.`
` First, I'll return the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Accept it!!"`
`As Kinzo violently opened the window, he ripped off a golden ring stuck to his finger and forcefully threw it away.`
`......At that time, thunder resounded, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring.`
`"And with that........., when you are resurrected, `
`I will be there.`
` I will live until the end and watch over you as you awaken.`
` .........So, come Beatrice...`
` Welcome to my banquet...!`
` In exchange for all that I have created, show me another miracle just this one time.`
` ......Oooooohh,`
`...Beatriceeeeeee........."`
