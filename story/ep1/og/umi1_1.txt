`".........Should've taken the boat...`
`......the boat......"`
`"Faaalll!`
` Faaalll!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria, that's enough! `
`......But what a surprise.`
` I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler-kun."`
`"This guy can't handle vehicles for some reason.`
` Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.`
` You're a disgrace of a man, you are."`
`"......Ah, shut up.`
` That thing was seriously shaking way too much...`
` I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."`
`"You call that 'a little stressed'?`
` Heheheh, sounds like it'd be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler-kun.`
` Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?`
` You'd get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours?"`
`"Ahhahaha!`
` There's a good plan.`
` Battler-kun, you should go let Eva nee-san toughen you up some.`
` Still, it's so hilarious!`
` Ahhahahaha!"`
`"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone's got their own strong and weak points.`
` It's bad to laugh at 'em.`
` Wahhahaha...!"`
`"D, Dad, you're laughing too.`
` Hey, Maria-chan, you shouldn't laugh anymore."`
`"Shouldn't laugh anymore?`
` Uu-!"`
`Gyah, dammit!`
` Is being scared of planes really such a big deal? `
`Everyone obviously thinks I'm a big oaf now...`
` Tch! `
`We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.`
` From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.`
` The islands are right next to each other, so the distance of the trip wasn't that great.`
` By boat, it was a leisurely 30 minutes to the island.`
` After going to the pier where the boat to the island is anchored, we saw a silhouette waving its hand.`
`"George nii-saaan!`
` It's been so frickin' long!!"`
`"Ah, Jessica-chan, it's been a year since I saw you!`
` You've gotten taller again, haven't you?"`
`"Kyah-haha, don't gimme that, it's embarrassing when you say that every year!"`
`"......H, hey, Aniki, you've gotta be kidding me.`
` That's really Jessica?!"`
`"Wait a sec, George nii-san...`
` This big guy, `
`...is Battler?!"`
`We both stared each other down.`
`...She definitely didn't look like that in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}.`
`"Yo, Jessica!`
` What's this now!`
` You're kidding me, you look like a woman now!`
` What're these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!`
` Ihihi, let me rub 'em, let me~!"`
`"Don't screw around with me, I'm a blushing flower of 18!`
` Just like hair grows out, so'll other stuff!`
` You think I got boobs just so you can go and rub 'em, loser!?`
` And what about you, Battler? You got all ridiculously big only physically!!`
` Did you get a little stronger?"`
`"Don't screw with me, I'll show you how much training I've piled up since back then!!"`
`"You're pissing me off!!`
` I'll beat you at your own game!"`
`This headstrong girl's name is {p:0:朱志香}.`
`......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.`
` Anyway, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced 'Jessica'.`
` She's Dad's older brother's daughter.`
` That older brother happens to be the oldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so for now, it means Jessica is the direct heir of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Since Jessica and I are the same age and sometimes had little boy-girl squabbles with each other, `
`we've always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gather.`
` Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.`
` So, when we scuffled as a contest of strength, it usually went Jessica's way.`
` So even though I clearly understand that I'm bigger now, I still feel like I can't win against Jessica with my strength.`
` `
`".........Woh...ah...!`
` What the...what're you getting all serious for...?!`
` Owowow..."`
`"Hey hey hey, this is nothin'!`
` Jessica, you've gotten weak."`
`"Sh, shut up.`
` I'm a woman, `
`so there's no way I could beat a man with physical strength forever, right?!" `
`"Weeelll, that's certainly true!`
` The meat I put on my arms all went to your che~st.`
` It looks like it'd be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don't you thi~nk?!"`
`"I told you, my boobs aren't for you to feel up!!`
` Besides, how 'bout you? Did your cute lil' elephant-san get a bit bigger to go with the rest of you?!"`
`"Stop it, idiot! Nooo, you perv! I'll be ruined for marriage...don't touch my cro~tch!!"`
`"D, don't say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"`
`Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica has become that I had to seriously horse around to hide it.`
`......That's right, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.`
` And I guess she's just as surprised.`
` She definitely wasn't expecting she'd lose to me in a test of strength.`
` After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I've grown in the past six years.`
`......Six years.`
` Once again, I'm being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.`
`"Crap..., total defeat.`
` It's like I'm no match for you anymore."`
`"That's not true.`
` Even Battler-kun must have his weaknesses.`
` Right, Maria-chan?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Faaall, faaall!!"`
`"Shh, cut it out Maria~, let's keep that a secret, okay?"`
`"Fa-ll?`
` What the hell's that?"`
`"Heheh!`
` Sorry, but there's no chance Jessica'll be able to see that weakness of mine now!`
` After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!`
` Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat trip.`
` I never thought I'd start loving that piece-a-junk boat this much.`
` Ihihi!"`
`"Hu-h????`
` George nii-san, is there something wrong with his head?"`
`"You'll understand soon.`
` Very soon."`
`At the time, I didn't understand what Aniki meant by that big smile...`
`"What have we here..., oooh!`
` Battler-san, how big you've grown...!"`
`Who's it this time?`
` It's an old lady with an apron.`
`.........Oh, oh yeah, that takes me back...I remember now!`
`"You remember her, right?`
` Look, it's one of the servants, Kumasawa-san."`
`"How could I forget Kumasawa baa-chan!`
` Anyway, you haven't aged a bit in these past six years.`
` Wait, you haven't gotten younger, have you~?"`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho!`
` Lately, my skin has been getting all smooth and silky!`
` And look, hasn't my chest gotten even bigger as well?`
` ...Want to try rubbing it?"`
`"V, very funny!`
` My breast rubbing is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"`
`"Even I had some bouncy ones in my youth, you know~?`
` Now, now, please feel free to have a go!"`
`"Gyah, gimme a break!`
` It's girls I'm looking for!`
` Not grannies!"`
`The jokes I'd cracked about Jessica were being used against me.`
` Come to think of it, Kumasawa has always been the type to tease people.`
`"Kumasawa-san, stop that now.`
` People with one foot in the coffin shouldn't jump around."`
`"To sport with the young is the best rejuvenation medicine.`
` Hoh-hoh-ho!"`
`"It's rare for Kumasawa-san to come pick us up.`
` Now, I do wonder why?`
` Whenever you're entrusted with something to do, your lumbago always kicks in.`
` *snicker*."`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho, Eva-sama, you are harsh as usual.`
` I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.`
` Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.`
` Hoh-hoh-ho...!"`
`Eva oba-san spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa-chan's years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.`
` She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly letting that comment slide.`
` Well, I'd rather not say it, but old Kumasawa baa-chan may be past her prime as a servant.`
` She might act as though she's in good health, but between the headache and the lumbago, her body is wearing out.`
` To tell the truth, the very fact that she's still working is impressive.`
`...How old is she this year again? `
`She must be pushing eighty at least.`
` It's incredible that she's still able to act so brightly.`
`"You just seem to get more and more lively.`
` Oh, that's right, here you are.`
` It's the tea I told you about before.`
` Look, I bought you some.`
` Please do try it later on."`
`Rosa oba-san took a souvenir bag out from her suitcase.`
` To think that she remembered the promise that she had apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.`
` ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Rosa oba-san.`
` She wasn't the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.`
` Whether or not Kumasawa baa-chan remembered this year-old promise, she seemed deeply touched by the fact that someone would bring a gift to a simple servant like her.`
` This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo-san ({p:0:熊沢} {p:0:チヨ}).`
` She's a senior servant who's been working for the Ushiromiya head house for many years.`
` As you could expect from someone her age, she isn't that good at manual labor, but from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry, she's a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything.`
` It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.`
` I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.`
`......In Kumasawa baa-chan's case, maybe we should call that a sort of lazy craftiness.`
`...Though it probably doesn't impress those paying her salary.`
` Ah well, even if she's pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.`
` I guess that's probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.`
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits!`
` How's your back doin' then?"`
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better.`
` According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.`
` It's what's called an incurable disease, hoh-hoh-ho!"`
`"At any rate, Jessica-chan's only gotten prettier.`
` Good thing she looks like Natsuhi nee-san."`
`"R, really...?`
` Personally, I don't think we look alike at all...`
` I mean, I don't even want to look like my parents.`
` 'Cause I got zero respect for 'em."`
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things.`
` *giggle*, even though there are quite a few people who don't want to look like their parents in our family."`
`"Ah, that's me!"`
`"You idiot, don't you start looking like me.`
` Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` You're surprisingly alike, you and your father."`
`"Come on, you can't be serious...`
` Just how am I like Dad?"`
`"You're his copy in arrogance and self-importance.`
` Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii-san.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"Oh, absolutely.`
` Krauss nii-san and Rudolf nii-san are almost unbelievably like Dad."`
`"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?`
` Hideyoshi nii-san, please help me out."`
`"My my, Rudolf-kun, you're always so popular with the ladies.`
` I'm jealous!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho!`
` As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous.`
` Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?`
` Come now, Maria-san, let's get on the boat together, alright?"`
`"Get on the boat together.`
` Uu-!`
` Everyone gets on together.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared.`
` I'm used to being shaken by the waves.`
` With that piece-a-junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."`
`"Oh yes, Battler-kun, I forgot to tell you.`
` ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit so it was taken out of use a few years back.`
` Now we get taken to the island in another boat."`
`"Ohhh, right.`
` It's Battler's first time in the new boat!`
` It's super comfy!`
` And frickin' fast!`
` It can go at crazy high speeds!"`
`"Ohhh...`
` That means less trip time, right?`
` That sounds great!`
` Anyway, even if it's only a bit better than an airplane, as long as we get just a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that's really just awesomely great~."`
`"...Uu-.`
` Is Battler going to faaall faaall again?"`
`"That's only on airplanes.`
` Everything's fine now!"`
`"Anyway, it's the captain's pride and joy, and it's a kinda modded high-speed boat.`
` Seems he tinkers with big parts of it.`
` He was bragging about how he attached four-base high efficiency propellers to it so that he could break 40 knots or something like that.`
` I just remember how he's always bragging."`
`"Me too, I remember since we're told about it every year.`
` The captain says that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.`
` He says that at the time, even though it was only in a fishing boat, his opponent could go at over 30 knots."`
`"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high-speed modded boat.`
` I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler."`
`...S, super high-speed modded boat...?`
`...My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat-up boat that might sink at any time......`
`...but for some reason, I got this feeling of foreboding...`
` ......Probably just over-thinking it.`
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."`
`"Battler-kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much.`
` You might fall."`
`"Uu- Uu-!!`
` Faaall, faaall!!"`
`"Daaaaammiiiiit..., so this is why you were all grinning before!"`
`So this is the super high-speed boat that the captain started modding... Oh, yes, that piece of junk fishing boat from six years ago doesn't hold a candle to this one...`
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!!`
` Fall fall faaall!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Fall fall faaall!!"`
`"If I fall, I'll land in the ocean and drown...where's the parachute...no, wait, where's the buoy?!`
` Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"`
`"Waah-hah-hah-hah-ha!`
` What's up, Battler, what's with that kinda attitude, waah-hah-hah-hah-ha!"`
`"Jessica-chan, Maria-chan, it's not nice to tease.`
` Battler-kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck.`
` I think that if you stay inside the boat, you'll be a bit less afraid."`
`"Heheh, that's a no thank-you, Aniki!`
` Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.`
` The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.`
` That's why I'm here!!`
` But, it's shaking!!`
` I'm gonna faaall!!`
` Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shake faaall!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!`
` ......But Battler-kun, it looks like you really can't handle it...`
` I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you."`
`"Whooooa, Rosa oba-san, thank yooooouuuuu!`
` I confirm that safe, slow driving is the thing, even on the seaaaaa!!"`
`"*cackle*!`
` Don't do that, Rosa.`
` Ordeals are necessary to the young.`
` Right, Battler-kun?`
` If it's only this, you can easily conquer it, right?`
` Otherwise, you won't be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"`
`"Whooooa, Eva oba-san, you're meeeeeeeeaaaan!`
` Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!!`
` Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute?!!`
` Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!`
` N-no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!`
` What's the enemy aiming for?!`
` He wants to make me afraid like this?!`
` If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!!`
` But stooopp iiit, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!"`
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,`
` Rosa oba-san had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...`
`"............Haa...`
` This speed is a bit better...`
`.........earlier, I didn't even feel alive......"`
`Apparently, the max speed I can tolerate is extremely slow.`
`...But that just now was completely insane...`
` The whole boat was shaking!`
` Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface! `
`It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...`
` Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.`
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I'm no worse off where it really counts.`
` But seriously, hahahahahah!"`
`"Dammit..., go ahead and laugh.`
` One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and I'll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"`
`"Ahahaha, well, we'll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!`
` Waah-hah-hah-ha!"`
`"Uu-.`
` Battler, all weak."`
`"Yeah, Battler, all weak...`
` I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."`
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.`
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.`
`"Battler-kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.`
` Won't you have just one?`
` To calm yourself down."`
`George-aniki and Kumasawa baa-chan brought us all glasses with floating ice cubes and canned drinks.`
` Judging from Kumasawa-san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.`
` Dammit, I'm so embarrassed that I can't bear to face any of them...`
` If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` How are Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san doing?"`
`"My old man and my mom?`
` Unfortunately, they're fine.`
` Though every other word out of their mouths is 'study, study', which pisses me off.`
` I'm so jealous, since it doesn't look like Hideyoshi oji-san or Rudolf oji-san say those kind of things."`
`"Hahaha, oh no.`
` When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told 'exams, exams'.`
` I thought it was annoying, but now I'm grateful."`
`"Hah, I knew it, George-aniki can be human too...`
` Anyway, I have to look after myself.`
` No one tells me what to do!`
` Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!"`
`"Battler-san, you still cannot return to your home?"`
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.`
` I'm still leaving lots of clothes and stuff at the previous house."`
`"......Uu-?`
` Battler has two houses?"`
`"Uh, `
`.........hmmm.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"Why?`
` Why do you have two houses?`
` Uu-?`
` Uu-?"`
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.`
` However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.`
`"Maria!`
` Look, you can see the harbor now...!`
` Look, over there!`
` Can you see it?!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"`
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.`
`......Ah, well.`
` I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.`
`......I don't mind that much myself anymore.`
` I am a member of the Ushiromiya family, `
`but the truth is that, for these last six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name.`
` When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I'd basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.`
` Don't get me wrong.`
` I didn't just run away from home or anything like that.`
` The only one at fault here is my dad.`
`......I don't really blame Kyrie-san.`
` Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat. ...Still, the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...`
` ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that.`
`"*Ahem*.`
` We'll be getting there soon."`
`George-aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.`
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion.`
` It seems this old woman has said too much already.`
` If I have hurt your feelings-"`
`"Heheh!`
` I don't mind it and no one's feelings are hurt.`
` Don't worry, Kumasawa baa-chan."`
`Kumasawa-san seemed to regret speaking out of turn, `
` but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.`
` After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.`
`"Uu-!`
` Battler, saw the island, saw the island!`
` There there there!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now.`
` Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit."`
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.`
` This island's name is Rokkenjima.`
` It's a small island about 10km around, located in the Izu Archipelago.`
` Since they call this archipelago 'the Izu Seven', lots of people think there are seven islands, but that's not true.`
` There are actually more than seven.`
` Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted.`
` Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.`
` After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.`
` In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.`
` So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure.`
` This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.`
` Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go to and from there.`
` There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.`
` The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.`
` Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.`
` However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.`
` You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply...`
`...well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.`
` The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,`
` and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.`
` I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten, `
`...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.`
` Come to think of it, I guess that means George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high-class gentlemen and ladies.`
` Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.`
` I don't see myself as being rich, and George-aniki, who takes self-discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable.`
` Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich,`
` and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all.`
`...Does that attitude really make us any less snobbish? `
`From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we really have been blessed with a lot.`
` This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't.`
` Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from.`
` I didn't ask to be born into a rich family.`
` And I don't think it's really something to be envied.`
` It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...`
` As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria started shouting and leaned over the railing.`
`"............Uu-.`
` ......Gone."`
`"What's wrong, Maria?`
` Did you drop something?"`
`"Uu-uu-!`
` Gone, gone!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria kept yelling 'gone, gone'.`
` At first, it sounded as though she had dropped something, but while she shouted, she also pointed out over the ocean.`
`"What's wrong?`
` What's gone?`
` I'll look for it too, if you want.`
` What is it? `
`............?"`
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.`
` One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that it was gone...`
` ......Strange.`
` However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.`
`"............Huh...?`
` ......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a Torii or something on top of a small crag around here?`
` ...That's right, it was definitely there.`
` I remember it well, since as we get closer to the island, it's the first thing to greet us, like a landmark."`
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler.`
` Even though it's been six years, you remembered."`
`"It was here, wasn't it...!`
` I remember too.`
` The {c:86EF9C:tutelary god}'s shrine and that {c:86EF9C:Torii}-like thing had been built all alone on that crag.`
` ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they.`
` They definitely were there last year, I think."`
`"Gone.`
` Gone.`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?`
` It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."`
`"I think so too.`
` It probably disappeared during the summer.`
` Whatever."`
`"Or perhaps a huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine...`
` ......The fisherman whisper that having a thunderbolt fall upon our honored tutelary God would be a certain sign of misfortune.`
` ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."`
`Kumasawa-san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.`
` However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,`
` and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag housing the god of the shrine was supposed to be.`
`"............A sign...of misfortune.`
` ............Uu-."`
`"Enough, Kumasawa-san.`
` Maria isn't old enough to understand this kind of joke."`
`"It's alright, Maria-chan.`
` It's just a coincidence.`
` Nothing scary's gonna happen."`
`George-aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp-eyed expression didn't budge.`
`"............Misfortune.`
` ............Misfortune."`
`Maria muttered that word over and over.`
` Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time.`
` However, since the word she was saying was literally an ill omen, it was a bit creepy.`
`"Hey now, Maria.`
` If you say it over and over like that, misfortune will really end up happening, you know?"`
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder.`
` And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.`
`"Uu-.`
` .........Misfortune...is coming."`
`"Huh?`
` And just where is it coming from?"`
`I answered light-heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.`
`...At that moment, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.`
` When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.`
` That's right, they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.`
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday.`
` Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.`
`".....................Uu-..."`
`...She apparently sensed some kind of misfortune in this cloudy sky.`
` She's been muttering that non-stop for a while now.`
` Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable.`
` She's just about the age that many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.`
`...For all we know, this might be due to her childish, sensitive nature.`
`"It's alright, Maria-chan.`
` The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."`
`"Uu-.`
` Pretty blue sky.........`
` .........Uu-..."`
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky.`
` There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear."`
`"Uu-...`
` .........Rain that doesn't end.`
` ...Clouds that never clear.`
` ..................Uu-........."`
`"I know the typhoon's coming, but soon it'll go away!`
` It's alright, Maria."`
`"...............Uu-.`
` ...Uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria started yelling 'uu-uu-'.`
`...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was was trying to say.`
` What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about? `
`Unable to understand her, we couldn't help but feel a vague sense of misfortune...`
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.`
` That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.`
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.`
` At that moment, Kumasawa-san quietly opened her mouth.`
`".........Rumor has it...`
`...that long ago, Rokkenjima was-"`
`"Kumasawa-san.`
` Let's not talk about that now."`
`Just as Kumasawa-san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.`
` For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.`
` I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity, `
`but judging by Jessica's appearance, it would probably be something that would further inflame Maria's unease.`
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery.`
`"......Hoh hoh hoh, I do apologize about that...`
` ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."`
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting.`
` When Kumasawa-san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.`
` After she left, Hideyoshi oji-san came along to replace her.`
` Since he'd shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,`
` so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.`
` So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.`
`"Looks like we're almost there!`
` Alright, just a little more!`
` Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it?`
` You all know whose fault that is!`
` Wahhahahahaha!"`
`"Aww, Hideyoshi oji-san, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"`
`"Ahaha, please, say more to him.`
` Honestly, because of Battler, it's takin' forever~!"`
`".........Uu-."`
`Maria probably thought that no one would listen to her.`
` She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.`
` As she did, George-aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.`
`"Maria-chan.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Because we're all together.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"............Uu-.`
` ...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..."`
`"Yes.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together."`
`"............Uu-."`
`"That's right, exa~actly what George-aniki said.`
` If we're all together, there'll absolutely never be anything at all to be afraid of.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, no doubt about that.`
` What George nii-san said will always be true, Maria."`
`"......Uu-.`
` George onii-chan always true."`
`"Yes.`
` I don't lie.`
` So trust me.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together."`
`"Uu-.`
` ......George onii-chan doesn't lie.`
` I trust you.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together.`
` .........Uu-, not afraid!"`
`Maria jumped into George-aniki's arms and hugged him tightly.`
` After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.`
` Her facial expression had undergone a 180 degree change, turning back to normal.`
` She was once again the ordinary Maria.`
`"Uu-.`
` There's nothing to be afraid anymore, because we're together.`
` ...Uu-uu-."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...You look all better now.`
` You're strong, that's awesome!"`
`"......Uu-!`
` Maria, awesome!"`
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here?`
` Maria-chan didn't get seasick, did she?`
` Hm?"`
`"Hahaha, well, something like that.`
` We'll be arriving soon."`
`The harbor was already drawing near.`
