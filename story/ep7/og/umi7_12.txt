`The months and years slid by.`
` In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds,`
` enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall.`
` As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment.`
` The servants coming from the Fukuin House had switched.`
` There weren't specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting.`
` Each servant made their own decision about when they would 'graduate' from Rokkenjima.`
` Some of those who couldn't stand the environment would quit in as little as three days.`
` After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict.`
` It was also strict in the Fukuin House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima-only rules,`
` and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian.`
` It was probably easy to feel constrained.`
` That constrained feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation.`
` And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life.`
` The cycle usually lasted two or three years.`
` No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule.`
` However, I was an exception to that rule.`
` I continued to go to school in Niijima while still living as a servant...`
` That year, all of the Fukuin House servants quit at once.`
` It wasn't at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other.`
` All of my fellow servants from the Fukuin House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind...`
` Of course, I wasn't on particularly good terms with them.`
` On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time.`
` Even though some new servants had come after me,`
` the older ones had already gotten them believing that 'Yasu loses things all the time',`
` so it wasn't really any more pleasant to have new comrades.`
` Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once.`
` The Ushiromiya family had no quarrel with those who left.`
` Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place.`
` The Fukuin House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained.`
` So, all of the other servants left, and no one tried to stop them......`
`"Later, Yasu.`
` Don't go losing stuff again."`
`"......I don't lose things anymore."`
`"Hmph, later.`
` Make sure you listen to what Madam says.`
` Don't you go troubling the next group of servants."`
`"......You know, it's still a mystery.`
` Why did someone recommend Yasu?"`
`"It's even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long."`
`"It must have taken some guts to not give up and run away. `
`Keep it up, Yasu."`
`"I, I......hate being called Yasu..."`
`At the very end, ......I finally said the one thing I'd always wanted to say to them.`
` However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left...`
`"............"`
`"......Guess you never got a chance to become friends with them."`
`"I wouldn't even want to."`
`"Yep.`
` I'm sure they feel the same way, so you're even. `
`Let's just forget about those people.`
` They no longer have anything to do with us.`
` So, there's no reason to worry about it."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......You're right."`
`I felt just a bit disappointed.`
` I never got a chance to prove to them that I could take care of myself.`
`"It's hard for people to throw off their first impressions.`
` ......That's just how it is. `
`No matter how wonderful a person you grow into,`
` they would probably always call you Yasu and make fun of you.`
` There's no reason for you to want their admiration."`
`"......Yes.`
` Yeah, you're right, Shannon.`
` I'll completely forget about those people."`
`"Good.`
` You have two great friends, Kumasawa-san and me.`
` And if you want to prove that you can take care of yourself, prove it to the new servants who are coming."`
`Shannon was exactly right.`
` Ever since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high, I'd regained my confidence and pride.`
`......I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant.`
` The new servants who come will still probably be older than me,`
` but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant.`
` Genji-sama even told me to guide the newer servants...`
` Okay.`
` ......I'll give it my all.`
`"That's the right attitude.`
` Let's give it our all together."`
`"Yeah!"`
`"My name is Asune ({p:0:明日音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"My name is Berune ({p:0:鐘音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`............`
` The newly arrived servants looked......a bit superficial.`
` When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous.`
` However, I couldn't see any trace of that nervousness on these girls...`
`"Yes.`
` Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected."`
`"How were they selected?`
` Who did it?"`
`"The board of directors came and interviewed them.`
` And other things, like watching their everyday conduct..."`
`"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?"`
`"......Well, `
`ummm, `
`...there were times that they passed because the adults thought they looked suitable..."`
`"All of the children who came from the Fukuin House were highly individualistic.`
` They polished that attitude while they worked as servants,`
` and eventually grew to be servants that would not shame the Ushiromiya family."`
`"However, encouraging this behavior was the role of the more experienced servants.`
` ......Since I was the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them."`
`"What were the new kids like?"`
`"They were the elite, of course!`
` Of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"......I think they were like that when Madam and Genji-sama were around. `
`However, `
`......when their superiors weren't around, `
`......well, they didn't take things quite as seriously..."`
`"Asune-san...`
` Make sure you put your tools on the cart when you're done using them."`
`"Kyahhahahahaha! `
`......Huh?`
` Su~re. So~rry."`
`I also have to be alert as a more experienced servant.`
`"And Berune-san, you shouldn't set your key down in a place like that.`
` You'll lose it."`
`"I'm not gonna lose it.`
` I never forget where I put things."`
`When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I had done now.`
` They would probably have been mean and obnoxious about it.`
` I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn't take me seriously...`
`"L, listen up.`
` You know there's a witch living in the mansion, don't you...?"`
`"Oooh, Beatri~ce!"`
`"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!"`
`"Don't tell me `
`you believe in that too, Shannon-chan?"`
`"Y, yes, she really exists...`
` If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..."`
`"That's right.`
` It's gotten me into trouble many times..."`
`"A witch hiding things?"`
`"That's totally impossible."`
`"After all-"`
`"There's no way witches could exist! `
`Kyahhahahahaha!"`
`"There's no way they could exist.`
` ......Witches."`
`"......I thought they were just pranks.`
` No, ......it was just easier to think of it that way."`
`"Do you think the witch Beatrice actually existed...?"`
`"I don't believe it."`
`"......I don't know if it was Beatrice, `
`but I do think that something that wasn't human...`
`...really did exist in that mansion."`
`"Do you think there's a chance that this non-human thing was Beatrice...?"`
`"Ridiculous."`
`"......I wish I could say it was ridiculous."`
`"That must have been a prank of Yasu's. No, not a prank, revenge."`
`"I did think that at first, but......"`
`"Did something happen that couldn't be explained away as a prank...?"`
`"......It was persistent.`
` ......And creepy."`
`"Specifically, what sorts of things happened?"`
`"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second."`
`"Didn't Yasu just hide them?"`
`"I thought so at first.`
` It was only natural to think that.`
` But I started getting this feeling that something wasn't right.`
` I kept thinking...could such a timid kid really get away with something so obnoxious?"`
`"Can you tell us what happened?"`
`"......When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn't looking.`
` ......But when a single key disappeared off my key ring and reappeared somewhere completely different, `
`I couldn't think of it that way."`
`"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren't looking...?"`
`"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?!`
` Hiding the whole ring is one thing,`
` but if you really think about it, taking a single key off the key ring isn't that easy!`
` The keys would clatter together.`
` I was standing right next to them, facing the other way, get it?`
` If you took your time removing a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would've noticed!"`
`"But a single key just vanished without a sound.`
` ......At that moment, I finally realized. `
`This wasn't Yasu trying to get back at me, `
`......it was something...`
`...worse`
`..."`
`"And where did you find this disappearing key?"`
`"It was...`
`...in my locker."`
`"Berune is pretty careless herself...`
` Are you sure you didn't just take that key off and put it in your locker......?"`
`"Why would I take that key off the ring?!`
` Have you ever taken a key off or put a key on your key ring, Asune?!`
` I tried doing it myself.`
` It's really stiff!`
` I would never go to all that trouble.`
` There's no point in it!`
` Am I a sleepwalker or something?!`
` How could I not remember something I'd done?!"`
`"I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid!`
` I don't forget about things I do that easily!!`
` And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room!`
` Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!"`
`"......Okay then...`
` Yasu, careful not to make any sound, `
`slipped the key off, `
`...and hid it in your locker.`
` That has to be it..."`
`"That's what I thought at first!`
` I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me!`
` But even as I said it, I realized.`
` Isn't there something completely wrong here?!"`
`"After all, on that day, we were cleaning that room with Yasu the whole time, right?!`
` There couldn't have been time for Yasu to noisily remove a key!`
` It was impossible for Yasu!`
` In fact, that should have been impossible for anyone!!"`
`"M, maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..."`
`"I already told you!! `
`The key really was there in the beginning!`
` I was the one who unlocked that room!`
` So it must have been there!`
` ......And then, I went into the room!`
` I'm stupid, and since I hate having the keys clattering around, I placed the ring on the bed...!"`
`"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone!`
` I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me!`
` So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I'd have heard the clinking!`
` And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!"`
`"......So okay, let's say that Yasu managed to sneak it away.`
` It's easier to think of that way.`
` ......But still!`
` How could Yasu have put it in my locker?!`
` Yasu and I were together the whole time, right?!`
` When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!"`
`"I'm telling you it's impossible!! `
`Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it.`
` I mean, Yasu's eyes seemed to be saying it silently. `
`......According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time wasn't because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ......but actually...`
` it was because...`
` impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me,`
` ......and......and...!"`
`"......Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?"`
`"Did other strange things like that happen?"`
`"Yeah, they did.`
` Afterwards, other things happened...and not just things disappearing...over and over...`
` ...Of course, I started getting nervous and made sure not to put things down in places like that, ......but that didn't help."`
`"......At first, I was angry at Yasu,`
` ......but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken.`
` One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that was in my pocket! `
`Then, I realized.`
` ......These weren't Yasu's pranks.`
` The same thing that happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!"`
`"C, calm down a bit...`
` I think some of those were Yasu's fault, `
`and the others were just you being clumsy.`
` ......It's true that the mansion's always dark and eerie,`
` ......and it does feel like the sort of place you'd find a curse.`
` I'm sure that's what made you scared like that..."`
`"You saw it too, didn't you?! `
`Remember that vanishing white shadow we saw in the VIP room that rainy day?!"`
`"......Y, yes, I saw,`
` but couldn't that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?"`
`"What do you mean, something white?! `
`Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?!`
` And besides, that VIP room is always locked!`
` They don't have keys to it!`
` That had to have been some kind of ghost...`
`...no, the silhouette of the witch!"`
`"............`
`...Ha...hahaha... `
`So, right, ......Berune started acting like this at one point.`
` Totally scared.`
` ......I've got more street smarts than her,`
` so the more scared she was, the more I thought that witches were stupid and couldn't exist."`
`"......Still, I had to be careful about what I said.`
` ......I mean, I realized that this wasn't something I should talk about carelessly.`
` ......All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders. `
`......But to the people who believe in them, it's absolutely not a joking matter.`
` It really was...no joke."`
`"......Asune didn't believe a word of what I said.`
` So, I eventually stopped telling Asune about it......and confessed to Yasu instead.`
` I told Yasu 'I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn't have been you'. `
`I said that something...`
`...strange...was happening to me...!"`
`"......And what was that kid's answer?"`
`"Yasu said that the same thing happened many times already, but everyone Yasu told didn't believe any of it...!`
` The older servants always made fun of Yasu, but that kid clearly wasn't as clumsy or stupid as they said.`
` I hated being treated like an inferior by a younger person, so I always resisted, but Yasu always got the work done flawlessly.`
` I've always thought it strange that people made fun of Yasu for losing things...!"`
`"I was then sure.`
` It 'existed'!`
` Some strange, inhuman thing 'existed' in this mansion!"`
`"And that was the witch Beatrice...?"`
`"If that's what you want to call it, I'll believe it.`
` Anyway, something that couldn't be explained away by human actions definitely 'existed' there!`
` People who didn't understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful!`
` They didn't get it... They just didn't get it!!"`
`"......B, but still,`
` ......it did freak you out for a while, but then you got a lot better...`
` After that, all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...?`
` So it must have been your imagination all the time......"`
`"You're wrong!!`
` I talked to Yasu, Shannon, and Kumasawa-san about it!`
` And they said that the witch really did exist...`
` The old servants all made sure to respect her!`
` They said I had been cursed because I'd stupidly gone around saying that Beatrice didn't exist...!`
` So I reformed!`
` Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room!`
` I asked Genji-sama and prayed at the shrine by the sea!`
` And then it all stopped, all at once!! `
`You were okay, Asune, since you stopped making fun of the witch,`
` but if you'd cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you would surely have been cursed next!`
` Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would have been cursed...!!"`
`"......It's true...`
` that it wasn't fun anymore...`
` I stopped saying it aloud, but..."`
`"You just don't get it! `
`You really don't!!`
` So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well!`
` A witch called Beatrice-sama lives in this mansion...!`
` If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!"`
`"............Berune..."`
`"When......things disappeared, that was a sign that the witch was close by and watching us...`
` If you said it was a prank, or that witches couldn't exist,`
` you'd be cursed even more...!!`
` It was like that for both Yasu and me! `
`When the key disappeared, `
`......that was a sign that the witch had appeared...!!"`
`Berune-san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean...`
` No matter how much I warn her, she doesn't change her ways.`
` She's always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won't listen to what I tell her......`
` Why won't she listen to what I say...? `
`You mustn't leave things lying carelessly about.`
` If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you......`
`"......Ahyahhyahhya!`
` Look at that delicious key ring......"`
`"St, stop it, please...!`
` That's Berune-san's key!`
` Keep your pranking to me alone.`
` Let the others be......!"`
`"You've gotten so cautious lately that it's no fun anymore.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, just kidding."`
`"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend's kindly advice.`
` Any insult to my friend I take as an insult to myself...!"`
`"......Are you planning to steal Berune-san's key...?`
` Please, don't do it...!`
` She'll think I hid it again...!"`
`"She thinks my magic is naught but the scheme of a child like you...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, very well then.`
` Let's just show her something that would be impossible for a human...!"`
`"Let's show her my magic!!`
` Foolish Berune!`
` I'll make you regret not listening to my friend's advice!`
` This flimsy body is not enough! I'm borrowing yours!!`
` It's been too long since I've shown you real magic!`
` Let my body return to the land of the living for just a moment!"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ............!"`
`A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock.`
` From that moment onwards, ......I couldn't move any part of my body by my own will.`
` Like a moment of shock after a blackout,`
` I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over my body......`
` All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly.`
` ......It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else's.`
`......I realized that the witch Beatrice was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time...`
`"......Hmm, very nice.`
` That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!"`
`Wh, ......what are you trying to do?!`
` Please, don't do anything mean......`
` This time, everything was backwards.`
` My words were spoken inside my heart.`
` And the witch's voice was coming out of my mouth...!`
`"Fear not.`
` I'll give you your body back soon.`
` I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank.`
` I won't do anything foolish that might make her suspect you...! `
`Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!"`
`Everything went completely white and my mind stopped.`
` Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body.`
` I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both of my hands, ......and come out the tips of my fingers.`
` It was an incomprehensible, `
`undescribable, `
`......unknown sensation.`
` My head went blank, and I couldn't think at all.`
` I could do nothing but abandon my soul to the sensation.`
` I finally understood.`
` This is...`
` what it's like...`
` to use magic......`
`"Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping......?"`
`My finger was moved like a puppet's, and danced around as though I was conducting music.`
` I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting...`
` When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it,`
` the key ring lying on the bed stood on end.`
`......Berune-san...didn't notice.`
` ......Neither did Asune-san.`
` They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room...`
` I doubt that either of them would have dreamed that a witch was right behind them, `
`readying herself to use magic.`
` They probably couldn't even imagine `
`the key ring doing a little dance right behind their backs.`
` It was like an anime fairy tale I'd seen once as a kid.`
` The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own.`
` I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me...`
` Yes, this is...pleasure......`
` As I powerlessly watched the witch control me, `
`......I couldn't help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic......`
`"Whoops, that's no good.`
` If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again.`
` ......All we need...`
` yes, we just need the key to this room to disappear."`
`Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic.`
` ...And thereby controlling the keys.`
` The key ring slumped down on the bed, `
`......and then just the mansion's master key stood on end.`
`"Well now, what shall I do with this?`
` ......Just erasing it would be so boring. `
`So, ............*cackle*cackle*!`
` Why don't I throw it into her locker?!`
` That way, I'll give my friend, who's been working here with her the whole time, a perfect alibi!"`
`"Come, try and remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!`
` Yes, it was a warm, dark place..."`
`"The inside of Berune's locker!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly.`
`......A gold butterfly...? `
`I see, it's gold because she's the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold.`
` And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs.`
` ......So, it's a gold butterfly.`
` The minions of the witch Beatrice...are gold butterflies...`
` After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared.`
` Then, the vanished key......went to Berune-san's locker......`
` Though it was far away, in a changing room locker, I could tell exactly how it had happened.`
` It wasn't by sight or by touch.`
` It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn't be explained by the five senses.`
` A completely new sensation that I'd never felt before.`
` It was the completely alien concept...called magic.`
` A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance.`
`"......That's enough, my friend.`
` I'll give this body back to you..."`
`Nn, .........ah......`
`"............"`
`It felt as though I had been spinning through space `
`until gravity suddenly came back and threw me to the ground.`
` Like when you're having a great dream, but you wake up suddenly,`
` ......and all you remember about the dream was that it was fun.`
` ......That sort of lonely feeling.`
` Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic.`
` I could still feel that sensation in my hands.`
` The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers.`
` No, that's not quite it.`
` The key ring and my fingers had danced together.`
` That fun, that excitement...`
`...still tingled slightly in my hands...`
`"Whoops, that was close."`
`Saying this, Berune-san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed.`
` She must have realized that I was staring at it.`
`"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn't leave keys lying about like this.`
` I'd never put something down and forget about it."`
`With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket.`
` However, she still hadn't noticed.`
` She probably couldn't even imagine `
`that just a single key had vanished while her back was turned for a second...`
` It's not easy for a human to do things like that.`
`......But, with magic...`
` With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ......it had disappeared.`
`"Alright, fingertip inspection!`
` Bed, okay.`
` Curtains, okay!"`
`"Tools, okay. `
`And keys too! `
`See?`
` Nothing wrong, right?"`
`"Y, yes, that's good......`
` Then let's go on to the next room.`
` ......Ah, ......Berune-san.`
` Could you......lock up this room for me?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Su~re."`
`......Did Berune-san's key...`
`...really disappear by magic? `
`Was that fun magic just a daydream I had......? `
`I was so scared of that being true...that I tested it.`
`"............`
`.........Huh......?"`
`"What's wrong?`
` Why're you taking so long?"`
`"......Huh?`
` ......Huh? Huh??`
` ......Wait, are you kidding me?"`
`"What's wrong...?"`
`"......It's not this one.`
` ......And it isn't this one. `
`......Huh?`
` What the...?"`
`"What is it?`
` Do you want me to lock it?"`
`"I, I don't get it?`
` What's going on? `
`......My master key's gone.`
` Just my master key is gone.`
` Wh, why...?!`
` This ring's so stiff... There's no way it'd come off......!"`
`I could faintly feel that tingling sensation `
`run across my fingers again......`
` That night.`
`......As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room, `
`......I looked at my hands.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
` The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers...`
` Is this...`
` how Beatrice...`
` how witches...`
` always feel?`
`......I have a friend who's a witch, called Beatrice.`
` She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic.`
` Because I saw this all the time, `
`.........I thought I knew what magic was.`
` But today...`
`......She had possessed my body and used magic with it.`
` The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time......still held my heart entranced.`
` It was a completely unknown pleasure.`
` Because......`
` By moving my fingertips, `
`.........I could make the key dance as I wished.`
` It was a strange, strange miracle of magic, something humans could not do.`
` I still couldn't let go of that excitement...`
`............`
`".........Shannon.`
` .........Are you awake...?"`
`"............`
`......What's up?"`
`Shannon was still awake.`
` Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise.`
` By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day.`
`......She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire.`
`......If I want to become a loved, respected servant like Shannon, `
`......I'll need to act that way too.`
` However, ......I wasn't confident that I could do that anymore.`
`"I guess...`
`...I can't become like you after all."`
`"......What do you mean?`
` This is a bit abrupt."`
`"You were my ideal.`
` Always."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"Everyone in the Fukuin House loves you and is kind to you.`
` ......Since you always played with me, you're the only friend I've ever had.`
` And you're also a wonderful servant, who can carry out any task in the Ushiromiya mansion both flawlessly and gracefully.`
` You were the target I longed to reach.`
` ......That's...what you were to me."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Let's give it our all together. `
`As they say, perseverance prevails.`
` Everyone will grow to acknowledge you more and more.`
` So let's aim to become wonderful servants together."`
`"............`
`......I'm...gonna stop being a servant."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Instead of a servant, `
`......I'd rather be a witch."`
`"Wh, what do you mean `
`by witch...?"`
`"I did...and still do...`
` wish I could be a servant loved and relied upon by everybody.`
` ......But right now, `
`I want to be a witch...`
` even more."`
`"Well, that's...`
`...ummm...`
`...huh......?"`
`Shannon was confused.`
` It was hardly surprising.`
` ......All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable.`
` But she didn't know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch...`
`"A witch.`
` Beatrice.`
` ......You see, today, Beatrice possessed me and used my body to do magic.`
` That unknown world felt so...thrilling.`
` It was much more thrilling than the time I learned that I'd been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant.`
` It was like learning about a new world.`
` ......As though I'd been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like,`
` then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time.`
` It was...joy.`
` ......Excitement."`
`At that time, Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance,`
` and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker.`
` But I had understood it with my body.`
` If I had moved my fingers a different way, the ring could have flown into the air instead of just dancing,`
` and I could have turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly. ......I could have done anything.`
` True, Beatrice's magical power was still weak.`
` It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants filled with the anti-magic toxin.`
` However, inside that tiny, short-lived world, I could do anything at all.`
` Beato just happened to settle on making them dance and turning the key into a butterfly.`
` But if she wanted to, she could have done anything else! `
`The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power...`
` I could still feel it in my fingertips.`
` Could it be that, along with that sensation, a fragment of that magical power might also remain...? `
`I can tell.`
` It's still there.`
` ......There's still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation.`
` I can do it.`
` ......I can still......do it......`
`".........Ah......"`
`A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room.`
` It was right between my clasped hands.`
` When I slowly opened them,`
` ......I could see a single dot that sparkled gold.`
`"What...`
`......is...`
`......?"`
`Shannon didn't know what the light meant.`
` How could light appear from the palm of my hands? `
`And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her, `
`......she couldn't understand what it was.`
` She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief.`
` However, to me, `
`...this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips.`
` The golden dot...`
` spread out...`
`...and became a small, gold butterfly.`
` It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like a cartoon fairy.`
` To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings.`
`......Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp.`
` But to me, it was like a remote-control plane in the shape of a butterfly.`
` I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted.`
` Not clumsily with threads.`
`......I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished.`
` I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly.`
` The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely.`
` ......It was an entrancing pleasure.`
`......However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken.`
` I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away.`
` Finally, the gold butterfly flashed and turned to dust like a firework run out of juice,`
` falling down and disappearing without a trace......`
`"Wh, what on Earth just happened......"`
`"This is magic.`
` ......It's really fun."`
`"M, ......magic........."`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic.`
` ......There was still some magic left in my fingers, so I just managed to use it.`
` ......But if I became a real witch, ......I'd be able to use it whenever and however I wanted...to do anything.`
` Now that I've learned how fun this can be,`
` I don't want to go back to being human.`
` Being a servant is just too boring.`
` So, ......I'm going to become a witch."`
`"B, become a witch...`
`......w, wait......!"`
`"I've already made my decision, Shannon.`
` It's been fun.`
` I'll give you this room.`
` You can use it by yourself.`
` Later.`
` Goodbye."`
`"W, wait...!!"`
`As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ......a massive planetarium swallowed me up.`
` In the sea of the pitch-black starry sky, I was alone.`
` I...we...are alone here.`
`"I'm done acting the part of the servant.`
` .........I'm going to...modify this world."`
`"......Hmm.`
` Understood.`
` In that case, what will you do?"`
`"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn't be bad.`
` ......But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream.`
` I can't go back anymore."`
`"What will happen to Shannon?"`
`"......Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant.`
` She'll stay the same.`
` But from now on, it won't be the two of us together, but her alone."`
`"That seems a sudden farewell.`
` ......Ah, well.`
` Being fickle makes life more entertaining.`
` And what will you do?"`
`"I want to become a witch.`
` I want to become Beato."`
`"But I am already Beatrice."`
`"You'll still be a witch and my friend.`
` I'm modifying the world so that Beato is me."`
`"So, I'll be a witch who is a friend of Beatrice?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` So, from now on, you're a different witch."`
`"I understand.`
` Then, what will be my new name?"`
`".........`
` I'll put that on hold until I can think of one.`
` You'll be nameless for a while.`
` Sorry about that."`
`"No problem, no problem.`
` This is my precious name we're talking about.`
` You'd better take your time and think carefully about it.`
` *cackle*."`
`"You've been Beatrice's friend since she was young and couldn't use magic yet.`
` When we first knew each other, you'd always hide my things and make fun of me."`
`"I see.`
` And when Beatrice finally learns magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her. `
`So, I should act like a big sister sort of friend."`
`"Yeah, like that.`
` ......What should we do about how we talk?"`
`"It seems that the cackle has pretty much become Beatrice's signature.`
` Should I give that to you too?"`
`"Yeah.`
` The cackle will be mine."`
`"*cackle*`
`...uh, I mean, as you wish, heheh.`
` ......Then I need to find a good way to sound like Beatrice's big sister-like witch friend."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Or should it be...`
`...very well."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Now there's a nice, dignified voice."`
`"Heh, thanks... ...I mean, *cackle*cackle*, and just what were you expecting?`
` ...And what of my appearance?"`
`"Good point.`
` I've got a sort of blood-red witch look.`
` Why not choose a different color for yourself?"`
`"......When Beatrice wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white."`
`"Of course, ghosts are classically white."`
`"A witch...`
`...in a white dress......`
` ......Let's try putting it all together."`
`I need a different look than the witch in the demon-red dress.`
` A white, noble witch.`
`......Unlike the time with the red witch, I'm thinking about my own look now,`
` ...so I'd like to make it beautiful and cute if I can.`
` A white dress.`
` A noble look.`
` Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak......`
` No, she's like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness.`
` Then the dress should be the exact opposite to make a nice contrast......`
`"............`
`......And what of this form?"`
`"Is this the form of the new Beatrice?!"`
`"How beautiful!`
` Just like a noble princess!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...I've taken a liking to this form.`
` Not bad at all."`
`"......Looking good.`
` That's wonderful, Beato."`
`"Hmm. I like it.`
` I truly do like this form..."`
`"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that'd be great.`
` If I have to go around nameless for too long, I'll get all sulky."`
`"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name!`
` But first, there is something I must consider. What shall be the form of my magic?!"`
`"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme.`
` So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic.`
` ......When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about.`
` I'm not backing down on that part...!"`
`"*giggle*. Splendid.`
` Just perfect for the Golden Witch. `
`......Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?"`
`"Very well.`
` Even an all-powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting.`
` Then let us do it like so.`
` If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me."`
`Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically.`
` Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it.`
` As she did, ......there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers.`
` Beatrice can't stand spiderwebs.`
` That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa-san spoke of.`
` Since the witch Beatrice had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits,`
` she also inherited their weaknesses.`
` So, the sacred mirror is also one of her weaknesses.`
`......However, that sacred mirror in the shrine isn't too likely to appear in front of me often.`
` That's not so fun.`
`"......Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors themselves a weakness too."`
`"You often hear that mirrors have magical powers.`
` Isn't that nice?`
` Sounds just like a witch."`
`"If I look at a mirror, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out, so I try to avoid it.`
` Hmm, it sounds quite entertaining."`
`......If I really think about it,`
` I'll be bad with mirrors whether I make that rule or not.`
` No matter who I want or strive to be, `
`......the only face that will ever show in a mirror...`
` is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of 'Yasu'.`
` Mirrors, which will always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid.`
` That's right.`
` ......I hate mirrors.`
`......I don't want `
`to see `
`my pitiful self.`
`"You don't need to decide everything at once.`
` It's fun to build up a world one little bit at a time."`
`"True.`
` I understand.`
` I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world."`
`"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch!`
` I am the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me.`
` That is where I should be living, is it not?"`
`"A room for Beatrice?`
` Haha, isn't it obvious?!"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion......"`
`"The VIP room of the witch just has to be Beatrice's room!"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...! `
`Why didn't I think of that myself, hahaha, hehahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"Then let's go, Beato.`
` If we're going to drink tea together, we'll need a much better room than that cramped one."`
`"Indeed.`
` That room is too crude to welcome friends to and serve tea in.`
` We shall change rooms.`
` Let us go, my friend...!"`
`"......So, this is goodbye to Shannon."`
`When I looked at my feet, ......I could see my own dorm room far beneath me.`
` I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying 'wait' at the moment time froze.`
` She was as rigid as a doll.`
` Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse...`
`"So long, Shannon.`
` ......The days I spent as a human, with you as a goal and a constant comfort, were truly fun.`
` ...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch,`
` everything would doubtless have remained as it was."`
`......I was your only close friend too, wasn't I? `
`Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly.`
` As a parting gift, ......I will erase 'me' from your world.`
` Starting now, this will not be a two-person room.`
` It will be a single-person room, with just you in it.`
` I hope you continue to strive for your ideal and try to become a kind, `
`reliable servant loved by everyone.`
` Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, doesn't exist anymore.`
` So long, Shannon.`
` When I mature as the witch Beatrice and stride through the nighttime mansion where I will,`
` ......I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds.`
` However, when I meet you again,`
` it will not be a reunion.`
` It will be our first meeting.`
` After all, though you have heard the rumors about the witch Beatrice, you have never met her......`
` So long, Shannon.`
` Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale.........`
`"Wait......!!`
` Wai...`
`......t...`
`......`
` ............"`
`............`
`.........What...`
` was I doing...? `
`Was I...talking in my sleep......? `
`Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it,`
` ...and said 'wait'.`
` This isn't the first time I've woken up to find myself saying something strange, but...`
`......I don't remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up.`
` Could this be what they call......sleepwalking...? `
`Am I just tired......?`
`......Gotta sleep.`
` Gotta get back to sleep.`
` I turned around to face my bed.`
`.........? `
`My bed wasn't there.`
` There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on.`
` If I'm the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me,`
` ......that must mean it's my bed.`
`......That feels wrong, for some reason.`
` The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone had slipped out of them.`
` Who did...? `
`This is a single-person room with me in it, right? `
`So, that there is my bed, and the traces of someone crawling out...`
` mean that I was just sleeping there until a second ago...?`
`......But, for some reason...`
` that bed......`
` doesn't feel like my bed.`
` However, though all the other kids shared rooms, I, Shannon, was given a single-person room.`
` So, there's only one bed.`
` And it must be mine.`
`............`
`"......Am I just...`
`...`
` tired?"`
`I must just be half-asleep.`
` School starts early tomorrow morning.`
` And, when school ends, I want to go to the mansion, help out with some work,`
` and talk to Kumasawa-san about the mystery novel I just read.`
`"Time to sleep.`
` I'm probably just so worn out that I'm imagining things. `
`......Goodnight, Shannon.`
` Just crawl in bed and close your eyes...`
`...and you won't have to think about anything complicated......"`
`I went back into my bed.`
` It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn't mine.`
` Still, it might just be because I'm getting so sleepy, but it's starting to feel as though this is my bed after all.`
`......I'm just half-asleep......`
` I am...Shannon.`
` A lonely servant.`
` I mess up from time to time, `
`......but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves......`
`.........Goodnight, `
`......me......`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` I've had enough of playing the servant.`
` I've had enough of being human! `
`From this night forth, I am Beatrice! `
`The Golden Witch Beatrice, who has lived for a thousand years! `
`Praise me, servants.`
` Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift! `
`On the nighttime island, the mansion is my place, and that is my time...! `
`Oh, I am one yet many! `
`Yes, let our world swallow up everything.`
` It is like the raging seas! `
`Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this human book as a side dish! `
`So this is mystery? `
`So this is a closed room? `
`You call this 'a crime impossible for humans'? `
`Don't make me laugh!`
` With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for humans?! `
`Is there no splendid closed room magic that can do my name justice? `
`Oh, not here, not here, not there, not there either...all of them pathetic! `
`It's enough to make one giggle, but which is the side dish, the moon or the book?! `
`If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly!`
` I can flit about the island, the mansion, the vast forest at will.`
` I'll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds,`
` and when they check to see that a window is locked, `
`they'll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass! `
`I can be fickle, and do as I please! `
`Pranks at night will probably be a lot of fun.`
` Okay, I've decided. Let's play like that starting tonight!`
`*cackle*cackle*, how pleasurable!`
` Tonight will truly be pleasurable! `
`In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination! `
`My imagination shall become the source of my magical power! `
`So, very well, it shall be fun!`
` I shall expand it infinitely.`
` And let it swallow the whole island.`
` The island's night will be all mine!! `
`Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch! `
`Oh, I am one yet many! `
`Kihahahahahahhha, hyahhaha!! `
`Here's to the wonderful world of witches!!`
