`.........When I came to, all was silent.`
` The lights were dim.`
` And yet......the room felt large.`
`......Where on Earth......is this......? `
`I was sitting in what seemed to be a very short sofa.`
` It was very constricting, and there seemed to be several more of them off to each side of me...`
` Once I noticed that, I realized that I was in a theater.`
`"......Where on Earth......am I......?"`
`I don't know how long I've been here.`
` And, more importantly, I don't know where this is.`
`......Beatrice's funeral ended, `
`everyone went back to the mansion, and......`
`.....And after that, my memory gets fuzzy, and I can't recall anything else.`
` Then, I was surprised to notice the presence of another person.`
` Apparently, I wasn't the only one sitting in the audience seating of this vast theater.`
`......The sound had come from a seat to the side of mine.`
` When I looked, I saw a girl sitting several seats off to my left.`
` It was a face I had never seen before.`
` ......Who is she? `
`She looked like a high-schooler or a college student, `
`about the same age as I was.`
`"............Nnn......"`
`She groaned.`
` Apparently, she had just woken up...`
` I didn't want to scare her, so I decided to introduce myself first...`
`"......Hello."`
`"............!!"`
`Apparently, she was equally surprised to find someone other than herself here.`
` She jumped when she heard my greeting.`
`"......Who the hell are you?"`
`"I feel the same way.`
` ......It seems that neither of us is here of our own accord."`
`".........Is that...the One-Winged Crest...?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Do you recognize this crest?"`
`She looked suspiciously at the One-Winged Crest emblazoned on my collar.`
` Her stare, which was unmoving but not openly hostile, wasn't exactly pleasant for me.`
`"Allow me to introduce myself first.`
` ......I am Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Ushiromiya, ......huh?`
` What?"`
`"Lion.`
` Written as '{p:0:理御}', but pronounced 'Lee-on'.`
` ......Pretty strange name, don't you think?"`
`"......No stranger than mine.`
` But I'll have to apologize.`
` I don't know who you are."`
`"That's hardly surprising, `
`since I don't know you either."`
`"That's not what I meant.`
` Who are you?`
` There's no one like you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"And why are you so sure?`
` Do you have something to do with my family?"`
`"I'm a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"......But that's..."`
`She showed me her left sleeve......and the crest of the One-Winged Eagle emblazoned upon it.`
`"......I regret having to ask the same question, but who are you?`
` I've never seen you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............`
`......First they tear me into little bits, then they make me read...`
` ......What's next?`
` Which witch am I supposed to be entertaining this time?"`
`She spat out those words and seemed to be complaining about something.`
`"Ange.`
` ......I'm Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Rudolf and Kyrie's daughter."`
`"What?!`
` A, ......Ange-chan......?!`
` But you're supposed to be six years old......"`
`".........I was six during the year of the final family conference on Rokkenjima.`
` ......Now I get it.`
` So, you're a person from the year 1986.`
` I'm 18 years old.`
` And I'm from the year 1998."`
`"I, in other words, ......you're the Ange-chan...of 12 years in the future......?"`
`"I'm glad you believe it.`
` But, unfortunately, I don't have a clue who you are.`
` ......Who are you?`
` Who are your parents?"`
`"My father is Krauss.`
` Natsuhi is my mother."`
`"That would make you Jessica onee-chan."`
`"Jessica is my little sister."`
`"............`
`...What's going on?`
` Wasn't Jessica onee-chan an only child...?"`
`By this point, I was starting to figure out the situation this Ange had come from.`
`......She's probably from the world where I awakened as a witch...the world where Lion doesn't exist.`
`"It will be a bit difficult to explain, ......but think of it this way.`
` In a world slightly different from the one you know, I am also a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In your world, a different fate leads me to walk a different path through life, so that I do not live as an Ushiromiya family member."`
`".........Are you...a witch...?"`
`"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just an ordinary human.`
` ......What I just told you is something I heard from the witch called Bernkastel-san."`
`".........Bernkastel?`
` That one with the long, blue hair and the gloomy face...?"`
`"Y, ......yes.`
` That probably describes her, I think......"`
`".........In other words,`
` I've been forced to play along with another witch's farce.`
` ......Just where is this place?"`
`"I only woke up a second ago myself.`
` ......I wonder where this is."`
`"It looks like a theater.`
` ......Are we supposed to watch a play, or something?"`
`"......I'm really not in the mood now.`
` Let's look for an exit."`
`".........You haven't noticed yet?`
` Look."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Ah, these are......"`
`*clank*.`
` I finally noticed. `
`Both of my wrists and ankles had chains attached to them.`
` As long as I sat here, I had enough slack that I could move about a little, but it looked like there wouldn't be nearly enough for me to get out of this place.`
`"......When did...`
` ......Who would do something like this......?"`
`".........Once a witch has made you her piece,`
` you'll be their plaything forever.`
` ......There's no way to escape."`
`Ange crossed her legs, making the chains clank together.`
` She realized that no amount of struggling could have broken those chains.`
` ......Getting panicky wouldn't accomplish anything.`
` She must have had nerves of steel.`
`"What do you mean, a witch's piece?"`
`"......It's like being their slave.`
` ......I made a deal, once.`
` ......I said I wanted to see my family, to bring them back from that day.`
` In exchange for making that a possibility, that witch turned me into a witch's piece.`
` .........At least the witch kept her promise.`
` I was able to see Onii-chan again."`
`"......You mean Battler-kun......?"`
`"Well, I wasn't even able to tell him who I was.`
` ......And, in exchange for that short bit of time, I'm now trapped inside the witches' toy box for all eternity.`
` ......Looks like you are too.`
` ......Did you make some sort of contract?"`
`"N, nothing of the sort......"`
`"Did you ever ask a witch to grant a wish for you?"`
`"Never.`
` .........She taught me what a miracle my existence is.`
` That's all."`
`"......Either way, neither of us is getting out of here.`
` ......Okay, witches!`
` What kind of show do you have for us this time?!`
` Have we moved from reading aloud to theatergoing?`
` Am I supposed to watch someone else read aloud this time, or what?!`
` If that's it, then start it up.`
` I'm bored enough as it is!"`
`Ange yelled this to the pitch-black stage.`
` Her voice reverberated throughout the theater, but no one gave an answer......`
`......No, someone did.`
` And that was also in a voice that rang out across the theater.`
` However, that voice sounded theatrical, as though someone was announcing the start of a play.`
`"What happened on that day, you ask?`
` I'm not telling.`
` Why don't you just give up and die?!"`
`"......Whose voice was that...?"`
`"That old hag.`
` It was Eva oba-san's voice."`
`"What does she mean by 'what happened on that day'?"`
`"......She's talking about the 4th and 5th of October in the year 1986.`
` ......The day of the final family conference on Rokkenjima."`
`"In other words, ......today."`
`Today is October 4th, 1986.`
` As a prelude to the family conference, Beatrice's funeral was held...`
`"That's a surprise.`
` So, you've come here from October 4th, 1986? `
`Tell me.`
` What happened during those two days...?!"`
`The answer she seeks is inside the cat box.`
` All I can tell her about is my close call with a sad life.`
` However, I doubt that explanation would satisfy her.`
` Then, ......a pillar of bright light pierced the stage.`
` There stood a white shadow.`
`......That white dress was obviously Clair's.`
` Of course, Ange didn't recognize her.`
` She looked suspicious, apparently wondering who in the world this was.`
` However, even I felt as though something was wrong.`
`......Didn't she settle all of her regrets in that funeral a short while ago, before being sent off into the next world...? `
`She stood all alone in the narrow beam of light in the center of the stage, and the expression on her face was lifeless.`
` The light began to grow brighter and brighter.`
` It shone more and more fiercely on her, until it became blinding just to look at her.`
` The world was enveloped by a light so bright that we couldn't open our eyes,`
` enveloped by a sound like wind or television static...`
`...and our minds began to go blank...`
`"Whoo......!`
` They're bloomin' wonderfully again this year!"`
`"It must be a pain to take care of all these.`
` Pretty easy for us though, just looking at 'em."`
`"*giggle*. I agree.`
` We've got to thank the people who take care of them for us."`
`"But it is a bit lacking in grace.`
` I prefer the way it used to be, before Nii-san decided to pile so much on."`
`"I did like the way the old ones looked."`
`"Uu-!`
` I love roses!`
` I'd like them even more if they didn't have thorns!`
` Uu-!"`
`"Whoa!`
` Now I remember this old garden!`
` I'd totally forgotten about it these past six years...!"`
`"It has been a long time for you.`
` Both you and this garden have changed so much."`
`"Ah, let me introduce you!`
` This is Kanon-kun, one of our servants!`
` This is the first time you've met Battler, right?"`
`"......Pleased to meet you."`
`"You can just call me Battler!`
` Nice to meet you!"`
`"Shannon's here too, today.`
` Remember when we used to play together?"`
`"Ah...Shannon-chan!`
` I'd totally forgotten... That really takes me back!`
` How's she been doing?!"`
`"She keeps getting more and more beautiful.`
` You should say hi to her later on."`
`"Shannon and George onii-chan are really good friends! Uu-!"`
`"Maria, shhh!`
` That's a secret!"`
`"If you would, everyone, allow me to guide you to the guesthouse."`
`After enjoying the lovely welcome provided by the roses, the relatives followed Gohda in the direction of the guesthouse......`
` October 4th, 1986.`
` Rokkenjima.`
` A world without Lion.`
`......The day of the Ushiromiya family's family conference.`
` The mysterious letter that Maria read aloud after dinner, just as she had been told to.`
` The writer of the letter claimed to be the Golden Witch Beatrice and challenged the family.`
` Try and solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Otherwise, I will take everything.`
` It was Beatrice's announcement of the game's start, the same as the usual game's.`
` Had an unknown person appeared, related to the problem of the inheritance's distribution? `
`Where was the 20 billion yen worth of gold hidden? `
`What was the purpose of this letter? For what goal had it been written? `
`Who on Earth is this Beatrice? `
`It was the usual dinner on October 4th, ......where several bits of suspicion and paranoia intertwined.`
`"George-kun.`
` I'm sorry, but could you go to the guesthouse with the others?`
` My apologies."`
`"......Shannon.`
` Take the children to the guesthouse.`
` We will move straight on to the family conference."`
`"Y, yes.`
` As you wish..."`
`"Beatrice, the Golden Witch......`
` What a fascinating letter you've sent us..."`
`"She's telling us to solve the epitaph...?`
` Ridiculous.`
` That gold belongs to us.`
` Why would we ever give it up to some outsider...?!"`
`"......If we could just find that gold, we'd all be happy.`
` No one'd have to lose anything."`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` Looks like it'll be adult time from here on out..."`
`"......Give me a break.`
` Sounds complicated."`
`"Come on, Maria...`
` Let's go......"`
`"Beato's ceremony has begun......`
` Kihihihihihihi......"`
`"Okay, everyone, ...I shall guide you to the guesthouse......"`
`"......What's...all this about......?"`
`"Probably a replay of one of the old games, ......or else an entirely new game.`
` In all the games, October 4th happens in pretty much the same way."`
`"......A new game?`
` You mean, a tale that hasn't appeared in any of the Fragments so far?"`
`"There's no way they'd go to the trouble of chaining us down if they just wanted to show us a game we already know.`
` ......It's probably a new game.`
` That means there should be a Game Master.`
` ......Who is it?`
` ......That witch?`
` Bernkastel......?"`
`"I...can't imagine so.`
` ......Clair should have vanished already.`
` There should be no need to spin up a new tale..."`
`"Beato's game board was hijacked by those evil witches long ago.`
` Even Beato is nothing more than a piece in their games."`
`"......Just who is behind this...and what are they after?`
` What do they want to show us......?"`
`Before this tale began,`
` Clair definitely appeared on the stage.`
` She is the teller of the tale of Beatrice's game. Beatrice, the 'me' from a world of a different fate.`
` However, didn't she entrust everything to Will, who solved all of the riddles? `
`There should be no need for her to make new riddles......`
`......In that case, is Bernkastel using this tale to test me...? `
`Along with Will, I have at least touched the deepest depths of this tale...and understood the culprit's heart.`
` So, even if an entirely new tale presents itself, I should be able to see through the riddles.`
`......Is that...what my role is......? `
`Is my role to teach Ange about the truth of this tale......?`
`"......Do you know?`
` ......Do you know the truth of this tale?"`
`"I have several theories.`
` Still, none of those can give a conclusive answer.`
` The truth is always inside the cat box.`
` I can't say anything for sure."`
`In this world, Ange is absent on this day.`
` So, it's only natural that she doesn't know what happened.`
` However, at the very least, I do know who the culprit is...and what they were trying to do......`
`"......Yes.`
` I think I've finally understood my role in this."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"Apparently, you're here as a theatergoer, and I'm here to explain things."`
`"And what are you supposed to be explaining?"`
`"I know......who's behind the crime that's about to occur."`
`"What did you say......?"`
`"Thinking about this normally,`
` ......the only explanation I see is that someone's trying to make us solve the epitaph, aiming to grab the gold for themselves."`
`"I agree.`
` If they'd already solved it, they could just take it.`
` There'd be no need to challenge us to solve the riddle."`
`"It's a prank by one of the servants.`
` They're hoping to pick up the scraps from the celebration if the gold is found."`
`"I cannot imagine that any of our servants would do such a thing..."`
`"......Or, maybe one of us sent the letter, pretending to be a servant."`
`"If that's it, you're the most suspicious one.`
` You schooled Maria-chan on her part and made her read the letter, didn't you?"`
`"I, I wouldn't do that...!"`
`"Give that a rest, Eva.`
` We can't jump to conclusions.`
` Isn't this the time for us all to stick together?"`
`"That's right.`
` The aim of this strange letter is probably to disrupt our unity.`
` The more we let it affect us, the more things go the way of this 'Beatrice' who sent it."`
`"Kyrie-san's right.`
` Wouldn't it be best to simply ignore a letter like that from the start?"`
`"That is what I have been saying the whole time.`
` This sort of prank is not worth considering!"`
`"Yes, that's it exactly.`
` If a couple improbable claims for damages get ya flustered, you'll never be able to sell anythin'!"`
`"My husband's right.`
` This is a child's prank, and taking it seriously is just a waste of time.`
` If someone really wanted to shake up the inheritance issue, they'd come forward boldly instead of using something this roundabout."`
`"You've got it right there.`
` Someone probably wants to make us think there's another person trying to make demands about the inheritance, when their real goal is just to pick up the scraps."`
`"......I wonder if they'll ask for some hush money in exchange for staying out of the inheritance issue."`
`"If that's the case, they should have written it into the letter already."`
`"And the letter is just a challenge, telling us to try solving the epitaph or else hand over everything."`
`"The culprit is tryin' to make us solve the epitaph's riddle!`
` Nothin' more, nothin' less."`
`"So, it's simple.`
` If we let this letter scare us, we lose."`
`"Yes, I agree.`
` ......After that big mysterious show, like something out of a mystery novel, we've all gotten a bit too interested in this.`
` ......Hahahaha.`
` It seems we're all taking this too seriously."`
`"But who did it?`
` ......Such an aggravating thing to do."`
`"If it wasn't a servant, then one of us must have written it.`
` I'm not naming names, of course."`
`"St, stop it.`
` I really know nothing about this...!"`
`"Settle down.`
` Anyway, what this letter says does make a bit of sense.`
` ......All of us need money.`
` And, if possible, we need it right away.`
` No one here has any objections to that, right...?"`
`"......Of course not.`
` Who'd object to money or love?"`
`"We don't know when Father's inheritance will come to us.`
` ......However, the gold of the epitaph is different.`
` If we find it, we could just split it then and there."`
`"In a sense,`
` it's even closer to us now than the inheritance is."`
`"Assuming we can solve the epitaph......"`
`"......Everyone here has tried solving it on their own, yes?"`
`Kyrie asked the room at large, and everyone wordlessly nodded back.`
`"Here, we have four people who have inherited the blood of the one who made that riddle...and each has tried solving it on their own.`
` That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?"`
`"......True.`
` We've all been greedy and tried to go it alone.`
` ......However.`
` We've already reached a decision about how we'll split the gold up if it's found.`
` And about acknowledging Aniki as the successor."`
`"Though you demanded quite a lot in exchange."`
`"......I wonder if we can solve that epitaph...if we pool our efforts and work together..."`
`"Two heads are better than one.`
` And here, we have seven."`
`"Today, we reached a general agreement about the inheritance problem.`
` ......Why not take a shot at the epitaph for a bit of fun on the side?"`
`"Nice idea.`
` Let's give it a try and call it a break."`
`"......Ridiculous.`
` There is no......"`
`"Take it easy.`
` Just think of it as a game.`
` Let's have Gohda-san bring us something cool to drink.`
` We can take a break and all play with riddles as a big, happy bunch of siblings for once."`
`"Hmmm.`
` Well, the night is long.`
` It would be, at least, more productive than pointless inquiries regarding Father's health."`
`"I'll ring up Gohda-san.`
` He can bring us something."`
`"Let's have tea and sweets.`
` ......Oh, and a map of Taiwan."`
`Two shadows could be seen in the rose garden arbor.`
`......It was George and Shannon's secret meeting.`
`"I want you to take this ring."`
`"G, ......George-sama......"`
`"I swear to love you all my life.`
` Not just while we're young.`
` I swear to love you and keep you happy until we get old and go to our graves."`
`"......Are there any lies in your words?"`
`"Nope, none.`
` I'm confident in my resolve to love you and build a happy household together with you."`
`"And what would this happy household be like?"`
`"Well,`
` it will be full of happiness.`
` We'll have a house, with a car and a garden.`
` And one dog.`
` The garden will be a vegetable garden.`
` The kids will run around, and we'll smile down on them from the balcony.`
` That's what our typical future Sunday will look like."`
`"That...would be wonderful......"`
`"Whaaaa?!!`
` Those two're going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Why are you so damn loud?!`
` Maria'll wake up...!"`
`"I, I see.`
` So that's it...`
` Now that you mention it, they seemed to have a pretty good mood going on there.`
` ......That's right, we're about the age where you fall in love."`
`"We've changed a lot in the last six years.`
` George nii-san used to be a bit unreliable, but he isn't anymore."`
`"That's what I thought.`
` George-aniki's got one of those 'air of dignity' things around him."`
`......But still, Shannon-chan and George-aniki.`
` That's a bit unexpected.`
` They played together often enough six years ago, but I didn't think they were that close.`
`"......Well, six years is a long time."`
`"These six years have been huge for all of us."`
`"Yep.`
` ......A lot has happened to me these six years, and to be honest, I've forgotten almost everything about Rokkenjima."`
`"And I'd forgotten almost everything about you too."`
`"Now that really hurts, ihihi~!"`
`Talking together like this, it felt as though we'd been teleported six years into the past.`
` Those six long years, so long that I forgot almost everything.`
` And yet, it's coming back to me, bit by bit.`
`.........Shannon-chan.`
` Six years ago, you were part of our group, and we played together a lot, didn't we...`
` Back then, I think I might've......liked Shannon-chan.`
` That was the age when we were all overly self-conscious, in love with love.`
` Bittersweet memories of jokes involving melodramatic, flippant words.`
`"......That takes me back.`
` I think I remember saying all kinds of stuff that I'd be way too embarrassed to say now.`
` Gyaaah, just remembering it is making my face go red!"`
`"Hihihi.`
` Shannon might be a scatterbrain, but her memory's incredible.`
` Guess I'll just have to ask her all about your dark, embarrassing history."`
`"Qu, quit it.`
` That was six years ago, so give me a break...!"`
`......I see.`
` So, Shannon-chan is going out with George-aniki.`
`..................`
` What am I thinking?`
` Could this be...jealousy? `
`I didn't really think about it until now, ...but that thing Shannon-chan and I had back then...that was probably my first love.`
` Well, it's not like I have any right to be jealous, after forgetting the whole thing until we met again.`
`"Everyone knows that Dad's hometown was Taishou in Taiwan."`
`"Father still chews areca nuts from time to time in memory of Taiwan.`
` Apparently, he got hooked on that instead of smoking when he was young."`
`"......But there are probably several rivers there with sweetfish swimming in them."`
`"There are several mountain streams which are famous sweetfish fishing spots.`
` ......It seems sweetfish will live anywhere as long as the water's clean.`
` We're completely stuck."`
`"Could it be some nearby creek that Father used to play in as a kid?`
` He said sweetfish, but maybe we're looking for somethin' more like carp."`
`"......Or, it could be some sort of metaphor.`
` The river isn't necessarily a river with water flowing through it."`
`"What do you mean by that...?"`
`"Well now......`
` ...Who knows?"`
`"Kyrie has a point there.`
` Isn't it a bit too early to be sure that Taiwan is this homeland, or that this sweetfish river is a river with water flowing down it?"`
`"If we look at it that way, we're just stuck again.`
` The more you think about this riddle, the harder it seems."`
`"......That's it.`
` This is just a riddle.`
` ......Kyrie-san is right.`
` We need to be flexible in our thinking..."`
`"If we're looking for a river near Taishou, ......that would have to be Danshui River..."`
`"Are you even listening?!`
` We just said that it might not be the kind of river with water flowing down it!`
` Is there any proof that that river is a sweetfish river?!"`
`"Y, you're right...... I, I'm sorry..."`
`"......Well, it probably did have sweetfish in it.`
` After all, 'danshui' does mean freshwater.`
` Makes sense that a freshwater fish like sweetfish would be swimming in it."`
`"Sweetfish are freshwater fish.`
` So, a sweetfish river would be a freshwater river.`
` ......Is that how we get Danshui River?`
` Hahahaha, quite the word game."`
`"Now that's an interesting theory.`
` ......Let's advance our reasoning a bit further.`
` As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
` ......What's the name of the town at the mouth of Danshui River?"`
`".........It says 'Danshui' here."`
`"I went sightseeing in Danshui.`
` It was a calm and gentle harbor town.`
` Beautiful sunsets."`
`"Did you find 'the shore the two will tell you of'?"`
`"......Not really.`
` It doesn't ring any bells."`
`"I guess the beloved hometown wasn't in Taiwan.`
` It might have been Odawara after all."`
`"If we can't discount any possibilities, ......then we won't get anywhere.`
` We can't even get past the first line of the epitaph."`
`"Quiet, you're distracting me!`
` ......It has to be Taiwan.`
` Father wouldn't describe any other place as 'beloved'!"`
`"......That is one thing we can agree upon.`
` To this very day, Taiwan is the homeland of Father's heart."`
`"It's probably best if we don't spend too much time on the first line.`
` I'm going to take a look at the other lines.`
` ......Just a quick peek, starting at the first twilight."`
`"......Me too.`
` I'll leave the sweetfish river to you, Aneki, and have a go at the second half."`
`"On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices......`
` How mysterious."`
`"I, ......I've got it."`
`Eva suddenly muttered.`
` All of the others spun around to look at her.`
` Eva was flipping through the pages about Taiwan with incredible force,`
` then found the page she was looking for and slammed the book open so hard that it almost tore.`
` The whole time, they had opened to the page with place names.`
` As far as the overall mass of information went, this seemed the most useful page to start from.`
` However, the page Eva opened to was very limited in the scope of its information.`
` It was......a map of railway lines.`
`"......As you travel down the river, ......there's a village......a village.`
` .........!!`
` There it is, the village!"`
`"Wh, ......what are you talking about, Eva?`
` Explain yourself."`
`"Quiet!!`
` There's a shore too, and a mouth...!`
` I'm not sure what it means by 'the two', ......but there definitely is a village and a shore and a mouth...!!`
` This is it... This is definitely the village where the key to the gold sleeps...!!"`
`"C, calm down...!`
` Explain it so we can understand too!"`
`"......The Danshui Line?`
` ......I see.`
` So, the sweetfish river was actually a railroad called the Danshui Line?"`
`"Well, I doubt there are any sweetfish swimming there......"`
`"Look!!`
` If we follow the Danshui Line down, there's a station that used to be known as Kirigan!`
` Look at the characters it's written in!!`
` There's a village ({p:0:里}), a mouth ({p:0:口}), and a shore ({p:0:岸})!!"`
`"Sh, she's right...!`
` There's a village, mouth, and shore...!!"`
`".........As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
` ......True, that's the only station on the Danshui Line that has the character for village in its name."`
`"I see, it's like a code pointing towards this station's name......"`
`"This has to be it! There's no doubt...!!`
` We just need to look a bit further, then we'll definitely find out what 'the two who speak' means...!! `
`......L, look!!`
` This is it! This is it!"`
`"The town near the station with the same name has a mouth in the second character.`
` ......That makes a total of two mouths in Kirigan.`
` Are those 'the two who speak'?"`
`"I, ......incredible, Nee-san.`
` This has to be it......"`
`"Does this mean that the key is hidden somewhere in this town of Kirigan...?"`
`"I wonder.`
` ......The whole riddle so far has been a word game.`
` If so, isn't it likely that the sleeping key is also a word game?"`
`"I agree.`
` On the first twilight, the key selects six sacrifices, right?`
` So, it's hard to imagine that it's actually something key-shaped...!"`
`"......Whoo.`
` ......This is getting...damn interesting..."`
`"Offer up the six chosen by the key.`
` ......Let's think of a key that's somehow related to this!`
` And let's break down this name, 'Kirigan'!`
` I'm absolutely sure that this is a word game!`
` It has to be...!!`
` Think, everyone!!"`
`"That's interesting.`
` ......Though this rain would get me down if I were alone, it feels nice and cool when you're by my side."`
`"......It's about time for us to head back. `
`I'm keeping Kanon-kun waiting."`
`"You're right.`
` And I've probably kept Jessica-chan and Battler-kun waiting."`
`"It brings back good memories.`
` Remember when the four of us used to play together?`
` ......It was a lot of fun back then too."`
`"To me, it's a lot more fun now.`
` Because I get you all to myself."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Oh, George-sama."`
`They laughed at George's melodramatic line.`
` However, George's laugh seemed just slightly forced.`
`"......George-sama?"`
`"Hm?`
` ......Oh, I'm sorry.`
` .........Well,`
` I guess I still have a bit of a complex about Battler-kun."`
`"A complex......?"`
`"Like Rudolf oji-san, he's lively, interesting, and just full of energy.`
` He's much more attractive than I am.`
` ......I can tell how much he outshines me when we're together."`
`"That's not true.`
` You're very accomplished and attractive.`
` You aren't worse than Battler-sama in any way."`
`"......Really?"`
`"Yes.`
` Really."`
`"The truth is...`
` ......When I first heard that Battler-kun would be coming back this year, ......I felt bad about it."`
`"Why...?"`
`"......Six years ago,`
` ......Battler-kun was the one who was really close to you.`
` I wanted to get closer to you, but I just couldn't manage to get between the two of you.`
` ......You two just looked so good together that I could do nothing but watch on longingly."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` Wasn't it just Battler-sama making fun of me one-sidedly......"`
`"......Of course you looked good together.`
` There's no doubt about it.`
` ......I was sure that you two were going out."`
`"That never happened.`
` You're thinking too much..."`
`".........I really am pathetic.`
` I was afraid that I'd hand you this ring and you'd refuse."`
`"Why is that?`
` ......Why should I refuse your ring, George-san?"`
`"Because...Battler-kun came back.`
` I was afraid that you might still like Battler-kun...`
`...and that, now that he was here, you wouldn't have any use for me."`
`".........George-san?`
` Please, look at this.`
` You see this silver glint on my ring finger?`
` What do you think that is?"`
`"......You're right.`
` Sorry.`
` What's got me so shaken, I wonder.`
` ......I'm probably still jealous of him, now that he's gotten even cooler these past six years.`
` ......How pathetic."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` Those feelings are a sign that your love for me is so strong, you don't want to give me up to anyone.`
` ......If you're worried about my feelings switching to Battler-sama,`
` just love me all the stronger so that such a thing would be ridiculous.`
` ......Love me so much that I don't have time to think about other men."`
`"I'm scared too.`
` I'm sure you'll meet many women in the future who are much more attractive than I am.`
` Or, I might not meet your expectations, and you might tire of me.`
` It scares me to think that I might not be able to grasp hold of your feelings for the rest of my life."`
`"There's no need for you to be scared of that.`
` I swear to love you all my life."`
`"But even though I swore the same thing, you're having trouble believing it just because Battler-sama came back."`
`As Shannon giggled, `
`George finally realized that his own lack of confidence had hurt her...`
`"......I've fallen for a wonderful man named Ushiromiya George-san.`
` And this is a man who has sworn to love me all his life, and who has given me a ring as a sign of this oath.`
` With this ring here on my ring finger, I can give an honest confession."`
`"Sure."`
`"Yes, as you said,`
` ......I did like Battler-sama six years ago.`
` I think I probably liked him more than you then."`
`"However, `
`that was six years ago.`
` Now, things are different.`
` In these six years, I've sorted out my feelings for Battler-sama, and cut myself off from them along with the memories of the past.`
` Now, I exist only to love you."`
`Shannon spoke clearly and strongly...`
` George gave a single, uncertain laugh.`
` It was probably the same sort the George of six years ago had made.`
` Then, he stretched resolutely and hugged Shannon without saying a word.`
` In that moment, he shed his feelings from six years ago......`
`"I've got the ladder...!`
` Here we go!"`
`"<Quadrillion>.`
` ......This is the only place you'll find that number written on this island."`
`"One tenth of a '{p:0:京}'...`
` How suspicious."`
`"If our idea is right, there should be some sort of device embedded in that relief."`
`"We just need to check.`
` Who's going up?"`
`"I'll go.`
` Hold that ladder down, okay?"`
`"Be careful.`
` It is fairly high..."`
`Rudolf climbed up the propped up ladder.`
` Step by step, as the rain poured down on him...`
`"Look at the 'q'.`
` See anything?`
` Some sort of device?"`
`"Nnn......`
` Ladder's a bit shaky. `
`......Hmm?`
` Crap......"`
`"What is it?!`
` Did something happen?!"`
`"......Heheh...`
` Bingo.`
` Take a look at this."`
`Rudolf tossed the 'q' down.`
` It hit Krauss on the shoulder and landed in a puddle.`
`"This is......the key!"`
`"What does it mean?!`
` Rudolf-kun!`
` Can you take out the other letters too?!"`
`"......Yeah, looks like it.`
` Guess our crazy theories weren't far off after all!`
` What's the next letter to take out?!"`
`"U, ummm, 'i'!`
` And then 'l'!"`
`Following her instructions, Rudolf removed the six letters of the first twilight...`
` Now that they'd gotten this far, ......nothing stood in the way of them solving the riddle.`
` By trial and error, ......they finally reached the final stage.`
`"It says to gouge starting from the head, which must mean going from left to right."`
`"Rudolf-san!`
` Starting from the left, turn the keys before taking them out!"`
`"Got it...! `
`Now we've massacred all of the letters.`
` So, none survive on the ninth twilight."`
`"So?!`
` Did something happen?"`
`"It felt like something clicked, but nothing's different.`
` Did a hidden door open up somewhere?"`
`"H, hey!`
` Look at that!`
` It moved, I'm sure it did!!"`
`"............?!`
` Everyone, look!`
` The lion statue's facing the other way...!"`
`"Wh, what is going on?`
` Is there some secret inside the lion statue...?!"`
`"......That's not it.`
` It's probably telling us to look where the lion's pointing.`
` See?`
` Look that way."`
`"That lion's facing a different way too...!`
` What does it mean?!"`
`"It's guiding us, stupid!`
` We have to go in the direction the lions face...!"`
`Eva dashed forward.`
` The others all chased after her.`
`......The gold was right in front of them.`
`"......Now this is a surprise.`
` Who would have thought that a hidden stairway like this existed."`
`"It makes sense now.`
` Father didn't like people going near the chapel..."`
`"......I wonder how long that device has been there.`
` Judging by the feel of this underground passage, probably for quite a long time..."`
`"I imagine it was nearly the same time that the mansion itself was built.`
` ......The riddle of the epitaph was probably also planned many decades ago."`
`"Well, this is Dad we're talking about.`
` ......I try not to let the things he does surprise me, but this..."`
`"Just how far does this stairway go......?"`
`"Hey, maybe that old rumor was true.`
` ......You know, the story about him having a mistress in a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest."`
`"I see.`
` It's likely that this underground passage goes all the way there."`
`"......I wonder if it connects to the mansion from that day......"`
`"I think we've found the goal.`
` ......Look at that filthy door.`
` Something's written on it."`
`"......Whoo.`
` This is it."`
`Something was written on the door in red paint.`
` On the tenth twilight, the journey shall end, and you shall reach the capital where the gold dwells......`
`"Does it open......?"`
`"It does.`
` ......Ready?`
` I'm going to open it."`
`"So, we've finally reached the gold......"`
`"At least, ......I wish such a convenient story could be true."`
`"Let's open it, Nee-san."`
`"Right.`
` I'm opening it."`
`The heavy door......opened slowly......`
` Then, the gold-filled, underground VIP room showed itself......`
` They only had an instant to admire the splendid furnishings of the underground VIP room.`
` As soon as the mountain of gold next to the canopy bed came into sight, they all froze, stunned.`
` After a second, the stunned silence faded and was replaced by cries of astonishment and wild joy......`
`".........Incredible!!`
` Haha, hahhahahahahahaha!!"`
`"I, I can't believe it... It's 20 billion yen in gold...!!`
` It really...really exists!!"`
`"What a shining mountain.`
` It almost blinds the eyes......"`
`"Uhhahahahahahahaha!!`
` We did it! We did it!!`
` We win this game!!"`
`".........Y, you mustn't touch it without permission!`
` This is Father's gold!!"`
`"Oh, really?!`
` Then why don't you call Father down here now!`
` Right away!!`
` Your farce is already over!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee-san.`
` Let's put an end to the obvious lies, shall we?`
` We have a real mountain of gold right here!`
` Shouldn't we all be honest with each other?"`
`"Fortunately, we're all in a good mood and feeling very gracious now.`
` Just give it up already!"`
`"Nng......!"`
`A pile of gold this massive carries magical power within it.`
` That power draws out the most honest feelings within people.`
` The light from the chandelier glinted off the golden mountain, lighting them up with the golden sparkle.`
` It was as though the sparkle manipulated them.`
` For some time, they forgot their age,`
` and howled and laughed, running about and rolling around like a bunch of excited kindergartners at a park......`
`"......What is all this?`
` What's it supposed to mean?"`
`"Before the crimes occurred, ......the epitaph has been solved...and by all of the siblings together..."`
`"That hasn't happened in any of the games before now."`
`"......Supposedly, Beatrice decided not to commit the crime if the epitaph was solved..."`
`"Yeah, supposedly.`
` ......Hmm.`
` I wonder."`
`Ange snorted, ......but I believed.`
`......This is what Clair decided.`
` She entrusted everything to the roulette of fate, so she would obey the result.`
` She let the roulette decide her own fate specifically because 'they' couldn't decide on their own.`
` So, she'll do what it says.`
` She'll follow her own rule.`
` She'll definitely keep her promise.`
`"I don't think `
`the crime will occur."`
`"......Are you sure about that?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Her roulette has already made its decision.`
` This is the end of her game."`
`"If it's the end, what happens next?`
` Do they all become happy rich people and leave the family conference unharmed?`
` Does my family get an ingot that isn't chocolate as a parting gift before coming back to me?`
` Will it be a happy end for everyone?`
` You think those witches would chain us to chairs to show us a naive dream like that?!"`
`"............Nnn..."`
`When she showed off the chain on her wrist with a clank, I was unable to counter her with confidence.`
` But I want to believe.`
` Though this might be the least exciting ending, it is one way for Clair's game to end.`
`......Perhaps, just once at the end, she wanted to show us a world where no crime occurs.`
` Now that she has disappeared with no regrets, is she leaving us a parting gift in the form of a game where no crime occurs,`
` in a sense, the most peaceful sort of game? `
`I want to believe.`
`......If only these heavy, cold chains weren't holding us in place in this theater.`
`"I, is someone there?!?!"`
`Rosa's shrill cry brought the celebrating to an immediate stop.`
` Rosa knew she'd seen it.`
` The curtain against the wall had fluttered, and a shadow had been there behind it.`
`"......None of that, if you don't mind.`
` You're just imagining things......"`
`"Is someone there?!`
` If you are, come out...!"`
`When Eva yelled,`
` ......the curtain shook.`
` And then, ...a witch wearing a black dress appeared from the other side......`
` In an instant, everyone realized that the dress was the same as the one worn by the witch of the portrait,`
` ......and they realized one more thing.`
` This person......was the owner of this room.`
`"......Welcome to the room of the gold."`
`Her face and her voice were expressionless, blank.`
` The others all looked at each other, wondering who should respond.`
` Rudolf was the first to speak.`
`"......So, you are Beatrice."`
`"Indeed."`
`"A, and you're the one who gave Maria that letter...?!"`
`"Indeed."`
`"......Is Father behind this?"`
`"No.`
` This is my...game."`
`"If that's so, then we've won.`
` We've solved the epitaph's riddle and found the gold...!"`
`"We've accepted your challenge and won...!`
` That means this gold belongs to us, right?!"`
`"Indeed, it is as you say.`
` ......You have solved the epitaph splendidly and discovered the hidden gold.`
` This game ends in your victory.`
` ......This gold no longer belongs to me, but to all of you......"`
`"......It seems you're a good loser."`
`"Hey, you.`
` ......If we hadn't solved the epitaph's riddle, what were you planning to do?"`
`"The letter said that you'd take 'everything of the Ushiromiya family'."`
`"Yes.`
` I planned to take all of your wealth...and all of your lives.`
` ......I planned to do as I pleased with everything that exists on this island."`
`......The witch walked towards the table next to the bed.`
` Then, for the first time, the others realized what sat on that table.`
` They were...four rifles.`
` There was also a case filled with bullets......`
` The witch picked up one of the lead bullets lying on the table and played with it, her face still expressionless, as she spoke.`
`"If `
`the night ended before you managed to solve the epitaph's riddle, `
`......I planned to follow the epitaph and commit 13 murders."`
`"Wh, ......what did you say......?"`
`"......That's what I thought when I first saw that epitaph.`
` ......It almost looks like something you'd find in a serial murder mystery novel.`
` ......That's right.`
` If you had killed 13 people to match the epitaph, ......that would have made for quite a mysterious crime..."`
`"Th, there's no way you could do that all by yourself...!`
` No matter how many guns you had, killing 13 people...that would just be...!!"`
`"......I formed my plan with great care and constructed several alternatives.`
` I envisioned all of the actions you might take from tonight and through tomorrow...and prepared a mystery to deal with each of those.`
` .........I'm afraid I cannot reveal those at this point, but it really was a tightly-knit set of pleasant closed room murders."`
`"If there were just a few of us, you could've gunned us down in our sleep.`
` But there's no way that would've let you kill 13 of us...!`
` After all, we aren't that stupid."`
`".........It would seem so.`
` At any rate, I predicted that the epitaph being solved before the first twilight was the most unlikely result."`
`"So, the fact that we've reached this place seems to show that you've miscalculated."`
`"No.`
` ......Even this was one of the results of the roulette I wished to create.`
` This is probably the best outcome for all of you.`
` No one will die, and you can leave this island with the gold.`
` ......Congratulations.`
` This game ends with a perfect victory for you all."`
`If no one could solve the riddle, she planned to take a gun and commit a serial murder. `
`Everyone gulped as they watched the witch emotionlessly make her confession...`
`"......If your confession is the truth,`
` that means you were trying to kill us."`
`"Yes.`
` That is true."`
`"The hell......`
` How can she just say it like that?"`
`"You couldn't possibly expect us to treat you favorably after revealing that much to us, right...?"`
`"I am prepared.`
` .........You may do as you will with me.`
` ......If you hadn't solved the epitaph, I would have done the same to you, so it is only fair."`
`"......This girl's got guts."`
`"I planned this game because I was prepared to bet my life.`
` I am satisfied with the result.`
` ......If you wish to kill me now, I am prepared."`
`By now, she didn't even treasure her life.`
` As the witch spoke and walked near the others, they automatically stepped back...`
`"The gold belongs to all of you.`
` I planned to give everything to the one who discovered it first, but I didn't expect there to be seven of you.`
` ......I leave the decision of how to split the gold to the seven of you.`
` I will not involve myself.`
` ......And..."`
`The witch walked even closer.`
` The group parted, and she walked up to the antique clock behind them.`
` The clock was large and had a dignified feel to it.`
` The witch patted it and spoke.`
`"......Allow me to explain the device within this clock.`
` For you have gained not just the gold, `
`but the entirety of this island."`
`"What......do you mean by that?"`
`"............`
` If you read it like a murder case up until the eighth twilight, then there are only 13 people killed.`
` But for the ninth twilight,`
` ......it clearly says that none are to be left alive."`
`"What does that mean?`
` ......In other words, she was planning to massacre all of us?"`
`"......Don't tell me, that clock......"`
`"As you have guessed,`
` ......it is connected to a set of explosives."`
`"Are you the one who set that up?`
` ......Or was that Ushiromiya Kinzo?"`
`"Kinzo is the one who set up the device.`
` This device is the source of his mad magical power......"`
`"......I, I don't have a clue what you're talking about."`
`"In other words, `
`......Dad set up this bomb,`
` and if he ever went broke, he was prepared to wipe away everything, including himself, and die......?"`
`"On this island, Ushiromiya Kinzo made a contract with the Golden Witch and obtained the gold.`
` However, that was not all he gained."`
`"......Wh, what are you talking about...?"`
`"Wait, ......don't tell me......`
`......"`
`"There is that rumor about the remains of an old Japanese military base existing on Rokkenjima...`
` Could it be......"`
`"Your guess is correct.`
` ......Beneath this island sleep the remains of an underground Japanese military base from the time of the war.`
` Along with 900 tons of explosives."`
`"N, ......900 tons?!`
` Th, that's unbelievable!`
` If that exploded, the result would be unimaginable!`
` Forget just the mansion blowing up...it'd leave a massive crater!!"`
`"I believe an expert's estimate measured it as a hole several dozen meters deep and a kilometer across."`
`"......There wouldn't be......even a trace left......"`
`"Those explosives will detonate in response to a special device. `
`......And that is connected to the activation switch I just flipped."`
`The witch toyed with a switch on the top part of the antique clock.`
`"......If 24:00 arrives when the switch is in this position, the bombs will explode."`
`"B, but it's almost 24:00 now......"`
`"In other words, it won't explode X hours after you flip it.`
` ......It's a time limit bomb that only explodes at midnight.`
`"Indeed.`
` ......It is almost 24:00 now.`
` If an explosion is what you desire, you can just leave it like this."`
`"Who would want that...?!!`
` Turn it off!"`
`By this time, Kinzo was probably the only one who knew.`
` The secret base on Rokkenjima had started out as a submarine base.`
` However, when that plan reached a standstill, it was redefined as a top secret base for homeland defense.`
` A huge plan had been drawn up to have the army and navy perform a pincer attack on American forces if the latter decided to land on Kujuukuri Beach and press towards Tokyo.`
` As a trump card for this massive defensive maneuver, the navy started stockpiling large quantities of explosives and fuel in absolute secrecy.`
` And Rokkenjima base was the location those were stockpiled at.`
` The total weight of the buried explosives was 900 tons.`
` Also, fearing that the Americans might find out the island's secrets and seize the explosives,`
` they set up a system for the self-destruction of the entire island......`
` Kinzo, who knew all of this, decided not to remove this device, but to tie it in with this strange clock that could cause the explosion any night at midnight.`
`......Kinzo is famous for building up his funds using a vast store of gold,`
` and then using those funds in several sink-or-swim gambles, one after another.`
` Just what did his stockpile of gold......and the 900 tons of sleeping explosives mean to him? `
`At this point, we can only guess.`
` Perhaps the true source of Kinzo's mad power......wasn't the gold after all.`
` If he lost a big gamble and all that he owned, he could erase this entire island from existence with this device.`
` His whole life, he must have put the gold and everything else he had on the line......`
` Kinzo probably looked at this clock at times, ......maybe flipping the activation switch and letting the clock tick down.`
` Whenever things got tough and he got stuck, he would hide in here...and flip the switch......`
` Maybe he decided to blow everything away if he didn't think of a brilliant plan before 24:00 came.`
` He would gaze at the mountain of gold, listening to the clock tick towards his death as he searched for an idea......`
` Perhaps Ushiromiya Kinzo's real study wasn't the one in the mansion,`
` but this place instead......`
`"......That sort of switch sounds just like Dad.`
` ......So, maybe each time Dad worried about something, all of us kids were put on the line as well..."`
`"For our Father, ......it wouldn't be unthinkable......"`
`"This device now belongs to all of you.`
` ......If you want a massive explosion, use it whenever you please."`
`"A, are you crazy...?!`
` Who'd want a big explosion...?!!"`
`"......These explosives are half a century old, right?`
` Would they really go off?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` The explosives and the fuses are still working.`
` ......I tested them myself."`
`"You tested them......?"`
`"......Could it be......that?"`
`"Yes, now I finally understand.`
` So that's why the shrine disappeared without a trace..."`
`This summer, the shrine had disappeared without a trace, along with the reef under it.`
` It felt strange that the waves could have destroyed it without a trace like that, but no one had paid it much mind.`
` And now, this piece perfectly fit into the hole left by that strange feeling......`
`"Indeed.`
` .........I used that shrine to test whether the explosives were still working after half a century.`
` I believe you are all aware of the result."`
`"............"`
`"The little bit I used was enough to make that entire reef vanish.`
` It's easy to see how 900 tons of that would cause an explosion large enough to rewrite the map..."`
`"......If an explosion like that happened, all of us would most certainly die.`
` But what about you?`
` I somehow doubt that you were willing to commit suicide with the rest of us..."`
`"This underground VIP room is connected to an underground passage from the remnants of the military base.`
` If you go straight along that, you'll come out at the hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island, Kuwadorian.`
` It's about two kilometers away.`
` If you make it all the way there, you should be able to escape the blast."`
`"......I see.`
` So, you planned to escape to there just before the blast."`
`"I have only said that such a thing is possible.`
` ......You may not believe this, but if the ninth twilight ended before any of you could solve the riddle,`
` ......I planned to die along with everything else."`
`"......There's something seriously wrong with this girl..."`
`"She's insane...`
` There's no point thinking about it! `
`If we hadn't solved the epitaph, she would have used those guns, `
`or else that switch, `
`to massacre all of us, right?!`
` There can be no doubting that now!!"`
`"You are correct.`
` ......You have ended this game in the best possible way, without there being even a single victim.`
` ......I wish to convey my respect and admiration.`
` Though there were seven of you, you solved the riddle, which I spent so much time on, in a single night.`
` ......That is worthy of praise."`
`"I also admire you for your graciousness and honesty in defeat.`
` .........We haven't decided how you will be dealt with, but I hope to do all I can to reach a gentlemanly agreement."`
`"......Pay me no mind any longer.`
` I am already one of the dead, who was already prepared to kill everyone and die myself."`
`The Golden Witch Beatrice solved the epitaph, reached this room, and revived.`
` And now.`
` ......New people had solved the riddle and reached this room, ......so her role was finished.`
` When the epitaph's riddle was solved, ......Beatrice's illusion of the witch ended.`
` Most likely, no one in this room was capable of understanding her tragic determination.`
`......She herself was probably the only one who understood.`
` As long as the many selves inside of her understood, that was enough.`
`.........I am one yet many.`
` I abandoned myself to the magical roulette of endless possibilities.`
` The result...the answer...is this.`
` This is what the tarot cards known as the epitaph ceremony have shown me.`
`......Beatrice is already dead.`
` They did not kill her.`
` I killed her myself......in accordance with fate's command.`
` They will never understand, ......for all eternity.`
`............`
` The witch stared up at the ceiling without speaking for a while, then looked as though she'd suddenly remembered something.`
` She grabbed at the sleeves of her dress and took out some sort of card.`
`"Oh, yes.`
` I forgot.`
` ......I have no need for money after death.`
` I will give this to all of you as well."`
`"......A cash card?"`
`"I have converted a portion of the gold to cash.`
` This is for the account that the money is in."`
`"I see.`
` So this is the magical energy of the Golden Witch."`
`"How much?"`
`"I've forgotten the details.`
` However, there is more than a billion yen."`
`"A billion...!`
` Now that would be magic!"`
`"True.`
` There's nothing you couldn't do with that much money."`
`"Very true.`
` The strongest magic to counter the humans' anti-magic toxin is this magic of gold.`
` ......It may be that this card holds greater power than the ingots."`
`"Certainly.`
` Cash would be much more agreeable than ingots."`
`"Here you go.`
` .........I have no need of this anymore."`
`The card she held out......was not taken by any of them.`
` Who would ever just hand over a card with a billion yen in it? `
`The mountain of gold, the device for blowing up the island, the card with a billion yen...`
` ...All of these surpassed their understanding.`
` So, ......no one could bring themselves to take it.`
`"......I don't like it."`
`"......What don't you like?"`
`"Here you go, here's a mountain of gold.`
` And I'll turn off the explosives and give you a card worth a billion yen while we're at it.`
` ......It sounds far too good to be true.`
` ......You're trying to trick us somehow, aren't you?"`
`"I have no desire to trick you, but I won't try and force you to believe.`
` ......I have offered you everything, revealed everything.`
` What you believe and what you do is now for you, the new masters of the gold, to decide.`
` You are even free to disbelieve all I say and leave this place."`
`"Eva.`
` I can't imagine that she's lying."`
`"And how could you know that?!`
` I don't like how relaxed she's acting!`
` It's as though she thinks she's already won!`
` ......I just had an idea, a second ago!!`
` What if she's lying about which is the 'off' side of the switch?!"`
`"Wh, what do you mean, Nee-san...?"`
`"Just a second ago, this girl flipped the switch to the side she said would turn off the bomb!`
` But what if that actually armed the bomb?! `
`We solved the riddle, so you turned the bomb's switch to 'on', trying to blow us and everything else up, right?!"`
`"............`
`......If that is what you think, then please feel free to flip the switch on this clock.`
` It will be 24:00 in one minute.`
` ......The clock will show you the truth."`
`"Wh, ......what did you say......?"`
`"H, hey, what're we supposed to do...?`
` Is the bomb set to 'on' now?`
` Or 'off'?!"`
`"I don't think she could be lying...!`
` It's inactive now.`
` We shouldn't flip it...!"`
`"But I don't like it!!`
` Why is she so resigned to her fate?!`
` Why's she offering us things one after another?!`
` She's tricking us to buy time!!`
` She wants to buy time until 24:00 so that she can go down in flames along with us!!"`
`"............"`
`"Wh, what about the switch itself?`
` Is there some way to tell if it's on or off...?"`
`On the upper part of the antique clock was a metal switch that could slide right or left.`
` Right now, it was set to the left.`
` However, there were no marks in particular on either side to tell one which was 'off' and which was 'on'.`
`"Hey, tell us the truth!!`
` Which way is off?!"`
`"......Left.`
` It's off now."`
`"You idiot!`
` You really expect an honest answer from her?!`
` It's the opposite... It has to be!!`
` The right side must be 'off'!!"`
`"W, we don't have any more time, Nee-san...!!"`
`"Quit it, Eva!!`
` Don't touch the switch!`
` It's set to 'off' now!!"`
`"Eva-san, take your hand off it!!"`
`"I agree.`
` It's 'off' now.`
` If she wanted to kill us with a bomb, she wouldn't have told us about it."`
`"............!!! `
`B, ......Beatriiiiiiiice...!!`
` Don't think you can trick me......!!!"`
`"............`
`...5.`
` ......4......3."`
`"Nng, aah....aaaaaaaaaarrrrgggghh!!!"`
`The second hand of the clock......ticked past 24:00.`
` October 4th ended......and the curtain rose on October 5th, 1986......`
` The switch was still pointing to the left.`
`......The witch's words had been proven correct.`
`"......Have I gained your trust now...?"`
`"Y, .........you bitch!"`
`With a hideous, sweat-covered expression, Eva snatched the cash card away from the witch's hand.`
`"......How about a bankbook and seal?`
` We can't withdraw anything with just a card!"`
`"All you need is the PIN.`
` It's eight digits long."`
`"W, wait a second!!`
` I'm writing it down...!!"`
`Eva and Kyrie both took out a pen and notepad and began writing the eight digit number the witch told them.`
`".........That is everything I have to tell you and give you.`
` ......I will say nothing more.`
` All of my tasks have been completed."`
`After saying this, the witch spun around......and sat down on the bed.`
` She wasn't even looking at the others anymore.`
` She sat there like an empty husk which had, just as she had said, finished everything it existed to do......`
` For a while, everyone watched the witch to see if she would remember something else and start talking.`
` However, she said nothing else.`
` The witch who had called herself one of the dead was now little more than a large French doll wearing a black dress......`
` Gold is the only physical embodiment of magic that can appear in the human world.`
` Since ancient times, even a small bit of it could control men with its magic.`
` In that case, how much magic power would dwell in it...`
` if it was piled up in a mountain so high you'd have to look up to see the top?`
`"Don't be stupid, we'll split it evenly!`
` Isn't that the obvious solution?!"`
`"Didn't we say that half of this pile would belong to me, and the other half would be split between the four of us?!"`
`The yells of the humans dancing around the gold reverberated throughout the underground room...`
` In front of the pile of gold, they were arguing about how it should be split.`
`"Did you solve the riddle all by yourself, Nii-san?`
` You didn't, right?!`
` The four of us siblings solved it together!`
` Of course we'll split it in four equal parts!!"`
`"Coward!`
` Weren't you the ones who first made that proposal about the gold's distribution?!!`
` How can you disregard that so easily...?!!"`
`"You really think you're in a position to bargain?`
` When you're the ones hiding Dad's death...?!!"`
`"Y, yeah, yeah...!!`
` You've been swindling us this whole time, treating Father's wealth as if it were your own...!"`
`"All you need to do is split the gold evenly, and we'll drop all the rest.`
` It sounds very fair to me."`
`"Well, if you're going to say that, let's just try splitting it four ways.`
` Feel free to split this pile in four and carry your own shares home.`
` I hope you have pockets that can hold 2.5 tons of ingots...!`
` It seems you've all been driven mad by the gold and lost all ability to make rational judgements."`
`"What do you mean by that, Krauss onii-san?"`
`"Look at this ingot.`
` As you can see, there are no official markings, just Father's crest.`
` ......How do you intend to turn unmarked gold into cash?"`
`"Nnn, ......well......"`
`"Have you finally figured it out?`
` This pile of gold may be worth 20 billion yen.`
` However, that's only if you can exchange it for cash.`
` Are any of you capable of exchanging this many unmarked, unknown ingots for cash at the proper rates?!"`
`If it was a necklace or a ring, exchanging it for cash would have been a manageable problem.`
` However, to do that with several tons of unmarked gold that couldn't be made public...would be impossible for any normal person.`
`......However, Krauss could do it.`
` Among the several business friends that remained from Kinzo's generation, there were some who had black market ties and a lot of financial power.`
` The billion yen, which was tied to the cash card that the Golden Witch had handed out, had already been turned to cash by one of Kinzo's connections......`
` However, none of the other siblings had any connections like that.`
` They would have to rely on Krauss to exchange the gold for cash.`
`"Now you're finally seeing it.`
` I apologize for hiding all of those things about Father.`
` However, you're in no position to take advantage of that weakness."`
`"......Y, you really think you have such an advantage just because of something like that?!?!"`
`"What do you intend to do with that gun?`
` Please, you're scaring us."`
`Eva was gripping the gun so hard it looked like it might snap.`
`......The four guns that the witch had placed in this room were now in the hands of the relatives.`
` Just as the gold had led their hearts astray,`
` it seemed these guns had the magical power to turn their hearts to violence......`
` Finally, a scuffle arose between Eva and Krauss.`
` Off to the side, Natsuhi started arguing with Rudolf and his wife, and the grand underground VIP room was filled with thundering jeers......`
`"............"`
`After being forced to watch this scene for so long, Ange's face was starting to contort with pain.`
` It was only natural, after being forced to watch this abusive argument between her parents and her other relatives.`
`"......What on Earth....."`
`It was painful for Lion too.`
` Lion would have tried to intervene and calm them, if that had been possible.`
` The gold isn't going anywhere.`
` If you just take your time and think, you'll be able to resolve this.`
` From what we've heard from Eva and the others, they need a lot of money before the end of the year.`
` However, the billion yen cash card should be more than enough to pay for that.`
` Since it could handle their emergency expenses, they could convert the gold to cash at their leisure, then just split it amongst themselves.`
` Sure, maybe Krauss was the only one capable of converting the gold.`
` That might have given him an advantage over the other siblings.`
` However, this gold couldn't be dealt with by open means.`
` In addition to attracting public attention, it would also lead to various legal problems.`
` It was better for this secret money to remain secret.`
` If they wanted to get the largest portions possible, then they should all agree not to tell anyone about this gold.`
` In other words, to maximize their profits, they needed a gentleman's agreement that all of them would keep the secret.`
` Krauss did have a slight advantage.`
` However, it was possible for the other relatives to refuse to cooperate and tell the world about the gold.`
` And then, ......there was also the concealment of Kinzo's death to consider.`
` Krauss was an investor.`
` He needed not only financial clout, but also a certain degree of public confidence.`
` His advantage isn't big enough for him to act so overbearing.`
`"......The mountain of gold......has made everyone lose their ability to think rationally.`
` ......This isn't an argument between adults.`
` ......It's just a fight between kids."`
`"What's so fun about showing this to us......?`
` Or is this the game of some new witch...?`
` Are they watching us suffer from somewhere and laughing?!"`
`"............"`
`By now, ......even I didn't have a clue who was showing us this, or for what reason.`
` At the very least, it doesn't look as though this new tale is overflowing with affection.`
`......At first, I thought it was a tale of a beautiful world, where no crime occurred, since Clair had gotten past all of her regrets.`
` But something's different.`
` This tale is clearly filled with ill will towards us.`
` I'm sure of that much now, ......but I don't have a clue who would want to show us this.`
` Suddenly, a loud explosion rang out.`
`......It didn't feel like the sound of gunfire.`
` After all, ......most people living a normal life never hear that sound.`
`*drip*, *drip*drip*drip*.`
` The sound of thick raindrops hitting the floor.`
`......There was no rain in this underground room.`
`......It was the sound of blood dripping down......from Natsuhi's right eye.`
` The bullet had gone in through her right eye...towards the back of her head......`
`"N, ......Natsuhi......?"`
`"...I, it's your fault...for jumping at me......"`
`The gun...which fell from Eva's grasp...landed on the floor with a hard metallic clang.`
` As though in response to that sound, Natsuhi's head slowly turned to face the ceiling...`
`"......N, ......Natsuhi......`
` ......Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Natsuhi flopped backwards.`
` When the back of her head hit the floor, a red splash spread out beneath it, ......forming a single flower to adorn her dead face...`
`"Natsuhi......nee-san......"`
`"Wh, why did you shoot her?!`
` Why? Eva?! Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!"`
`Krauss howled, raised his gun, and ran at Eva.`
` At the same time, Hideyoshi leapt between them.`
` A scuffle broke out between the two men.`
`"How could you?! Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii, nngaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`"K, Krauss nii-san, you've got it wrong... You've got it all wrong... It was...just an accident......!!"`
`"Evaaaaaaaaaa, how could you?!!`
` I'll kill you! I'll kill yooooooouuu!!"`
`"I, .........I didn't shoot her... I didn't...`
` Even though I told her to stop, she just jumped at me...!!"`
`Krauss, who had just seen his wife killed before his eyes, had lost all traces of rationality in his expression.`
` He was so furious that, if he had knocked Hideyoshi aside and jumped at Eva, he might have torn her throat out.`
`"Why did you kill her?! Why?!`
` Evaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"It was an accident...an accident...!!`
` Calm down, Krauss nii-san...!!`
` ......Owowowowowow.........nngggggggggghhhh......"`
`Another explosion rang out.`
` Hideyoshi's face was covered with blood.`
` The two of them had been fighting over the gun Krauss held, trying to push it away from themselves.`
` When the barrel had turned to point at Krauss's chin, ......the sneering, formless reaper, master of the room of gold, had swung its scythe once more.`
` A line of blood......trickled from Krauss's mouth.`
`"U, ......uwaaaaahhhh, ...hyaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`The two fell down, with Krauss's body on top of Hideyoshi.`
` Letting out a cowardly cry, Hideyoshi backed away before Krauss's body could cover him...`
`"D, ......Dear...!!"`
`"I didn't do anything!!`
` Krauss nii-san's finger just got caught on the trigger...!`
` It's an accident...an accident I tell you...!!"`
`"Th, that's right, an accident...... This was all an accident......!!"`
`As the pair of them broke down sobbing and repeatedly claiming that it was all an accident, Rosa and the others were unable to say a thing......`
` The witch also watched this scene, but said nothing, and appeared to be completely disinterested.`
`"I, ......it wasn't our fault...!`
` It's just an accident...!`
` You saw, right?! Right? Right?!"`
`"You saw that, didn't you, Rosa?!`
` Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san both let their emotions get ahold of them and charged at us...!"`
`"......Well,`
` I can't say I'm sure."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` You saw, didn't you?!`
` You saw it from right there, so you must know!!"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I can't tell if it happened by accident...or if you killed them and tried to make it look like an accident."`
`"R, Rosa, you......!!!"`
`"Rudolf-kun...!`
` You saw!`
` You know what happened, right?!`
` Right?!"`
`"............`
`......Sorry, but I agree with Rosa.`
` We can't tell if it was an accident or intentional."`
`Rosa's and Rudolf's gazes looked very cold and indifferent to Eva and her husband.`
`"What are we going to do? They were shot to death...!`
` We can't just write this off as an accident...!!"`
`"Th, the forest!`
` We'll say they went to the forest and went missing! Then we can buy some time...!"`
`"That won't get us off the hook, right?!`
` The police will just search the whole forest!!`
` And anyway, why would those two go off into an uncultivated forest like that?!`
` It'll look suspicious from the start!`
` There's no way we'll get away with it!!"`
`"It'll be okay...!`
` If we hide the corpses here, no one will be able to find them!`
` If we all play dumb, it'll work!"`
`"It won't......`
` There's no way you can fool the police.`
` If the two of them disappear during a family conference where we were arguing over the inheritance problem,`
` ......the police won't just put it down as a case of missing persons."`
`"............`
`......I, I just thought of something..."`
`Though Eva had been scratching at her head, overcome with emotion,`
` ......her arms suddenly fell as though their strings had been cut.`
`"Wh, ......what did you think of?"`
`"......An accident.`
` ......We just need to make it look like an accident."`
`"Idiot...!`
` What kind of accident...?!`
` There are clear gunshot wounds on both corpses, right?!`
` Even if we burn them to make it look like they were caught in a fire, it'll still be obvious that they were killed by guns!!"`
`"......A fire?`
` That's not good enough.`
` ......We need more.`
` A much more massive accident."`
`"A, ......a massive accident......?"`
`Eva slowly walked forward, ......tapped on it, and spoke.`
`"An explosion accident.`
` ......We just need the sort of accident that will leave no traces of their corpses."`
`As she played with the switch that would cause an automatic explosion at 24:00,`
` ......Eva spun around to face them, a crazed expression on her face...`
` It was truly...a mad inspiration.`
` If they flipped the switch to the right and waited for 24:00, the 900 tons of explosives would wipe out the mansion without a trace.`
` There wouldn't even be remnants of the corpses.`
` There would be no way to tell that they had died by gunshot wounds before the explosion.`
`"It's an unshakable fact that this island is still filled with explosives from the war!`
` Then, by coincidence, tomorrow night...something will set it off by chance and the whole thing will explode!!`
` Yes, it'll be an accident!`
` An explosion accident!!`
` What do you say?!!`
` There's no way the police will find out the truth!!`
` This way, we can pull it off!!`
` We can hide the manner of their deaths!!"`
`"Ha......hahaha...how...ridiculous......"`
`Shaking, Hideyoshi frantically searched for a counterargument, hoping to repudiate Eva's mad idea.`
`.........But he couldn't find one.`
` If they blew everything up, the facts would all be muddled......`
` They could make it look as though Krauss and Natsuhi had died in an explosion accident......!`
`"It's perfect, just perfect...!!!`
` After all, it was an accident that they died anyway!`
` We're just changing the type of accident!!`
` Isn't that right?`
` We can think up any story we want!!`
` By chance, the rest of us will happen to be in the hidden mansion tomorrow night!`
` Then, when the explosion accident occurs, we'll be lucky enough to survive!!`
` That story should work!!"`
`"......J, just what sort of story are you planning on?`
` ......What kind of story could explain how the two of them alone remained here `
`while the rest of us conveniently went to the hidden mansion and managed to escape...?!"`
`"That's what we've got to think up now, stupid Rosa!!!`
` It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we all agree to it!!`
` I'll think of something... I am thinking... You all think too!!`
` Someone think of somethiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!"`
`"C, calm down, Eva...`
` I'll think about it, and so will everyone else!`
` We'll definitely think of something, and it'll all work out!`
` We'll share the burden. You won't have to carry it all yourself...!!`
` It'll be okay... It will!!`
` I know we'll think of a good excuse!"`
`"......What kind of excuse?`
` We took the kids and all the servants to go exploring an underground passageway, leaving just the two of them behind,`
` and the rest of us all decided to spend the night in the hidden mansion?`
` How could any excuse work?`
` ......It's insane!"`
`"And thinking up that insane thing is our job!!`
` Why are you acting like this has nothing to do with you?!`
` You think of something too!!!"`
`".........Nee-san.`
` Let me ask you a question.`
` ......If you blow up the island, what will happen to this gold?"`
`"Nnn, ......w, ......well........."`
`"We've finally gotten our hands on 20 billion yen of gold.`
` And you want to blow it all away...?"`
`"We can just carry it away...yeah, that's right!!`
` The explosion will happen tomorrow at midnight!`
` We have a full day!!`
` If we all carry it together, we might-"`
`"You realize there's 10 tons of it, right?`
` ......Just how much do you think our small group can carry `
`back and forth across this long, underground passage that goes all the way across the island?`
` You're being absurd."`
`"H, here!!`
` We have this card!`
` The card worth a billion yen which that woman gave us!!`
` We can just carry whatever gold we can!`
` We have the card with a billion yen on top of that!`
` If we split that three ways, we'll have more than 300 million each!`
` That should be enough for all of our purposes!!"`
`"I don't want to."`
`"Wh, ......what......?"`
`"We have a mountain worth 20 billion yen right here.`
` Why should we be satisfied with just 300 million each?"`
`"R, ......Rosaaaaa......"`
`Eva's face twisted in anguish, ......and was met by Rosa's look of cold unconcern.`
`"......Even if we gave Krauss his share,`
` we'd each have a share of 5 billion.`
` Subtract the 300 million from the card, and the rest of my share is 4.7 billion.`
` ......If you agree to pay that much to me, then you can do whatever you want with this mountain of gold."`
`"What do you think you're saying?!`
` So, you don't intend to cooperate?!"`
`"Nee-san.`
` Please calm down and listen.`
` This is the way that both of us can leave with the most money."`
`"Wh, what......?!?!"`
`"I want you to go to the police and turn yourself in, admitting that you got into a scuffle and the gun went off."`
`"A, are you crazy?! I don't want to go to the police!!!"`
`"Of course, we don't want to say that the crime happened here.`
` The police would find the gold.`
` ......Yes, what about the rose garden?`
` It's pouring rain now, so the police probably won't find any contradictions in the crime scene."`
`"I'll let you think of an excuse for why you and Nii-san started fighting while you were holding guns in the rainy rose garden.`
` ......Don't try to get us and our shares involved just because you want to hide your crime."`
`"R, Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` After all, it's not like they'll keep you in jail for several decades.`
` It was an accident, right? You'll be able to get out after just a few years.`
` ......When you've paid for your sins and come back, then you can do whatever you want with your 5 billion."`
`"No, I'd never do that!!`
` What would happen if we were arrested?!`
` What would happen to my husband's company?!"`
`"Who cares about the company?`
` With 5 billion yen, working any longer would just be a waste of time, right?"`
`Rosa had never intended to go along with the idea Eva proposed.`
` As far as the size of each person's portion went, no one had anything to gain from an explosion accident.`
` By doing that, they could conceal Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths.`
` There was no other reason to do it.`
` From Rosa's perspective, the ideal outcome would be for them to confess to their crimes, without any unnecessary tricks.`
` All she wanted to do was to change the crime scene from here to a different place.`
` However, Eva didn't want to be arrested.`
` She didn't like having her share shrink from 5 billion to 300 million,`
` but even that was more than enough to cover the amount she had been trying to wring out of Krauss in the first place.`
` She wanted to hide what had happened here, even if it meant blowing away 4.7 billion yen.`
` What would happen if they were arrested? `
`The life, the company and the trust that Eva had worked so long to build...... Those were things that couldn't be bought back with money.`
` So, she wanted to hide Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths, even if it meant blowing up all 4.7 billion yen worth of her gold...! `
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was just irrational nonsense.`
`"R, Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee-san?`
` ......Are you going to have me die in the explosion too?`
` That'll make finding an excuse even harder.`
` In fact, it'll also make it harder to explain away the other two deaths as accidents too..."`
`"If three people are killed together, that would become a fairly huge crime.`
` ......It would probably lead to the death penalty.`
` If you're lucky, it'll be life in prison.`
` Even in the best case, you'll be put away for more than a decade, right?"`
`"Give yourself up.`
` If you do, this'll be no more than a pair of unfortunate accidents.`
` Of course, your jail term won't be too terrible either.`
` ......Don't worry about George-kun.`
` We'll take good care of him.`
` And we'll make sure that all 5 billion of your share will be waiting for you when you get back."`
`Eva ground her teeth and glared.`
` The Rosa she knew should have been shaking and obeying her commands.`
` And yet, ......Rosa wasn't scared.`
` Her blank expression...`
` no, that slight smile...was one that Eva had never seen before.`
`"Put the gun down, Nee-san.`
` If you calm down, you'll see that my plan is the best one.`
` ......Jail isn't so bad, right?`
` Think of it as a financial strategy."`
`"Even if they put you in for ten years, there will be 5 billion waiting for you when you get out.`
` That's like working for a 500 million yen salary, right?`
` If you think of it that way, won't you enjoy your job more?"`
`"Liar!!!`
` You just want to steal my share away while I'm in there!!`
` Like your man did to you!!!"`
`"H, he has nothing to do with this, okay?!?!`
` I won't run away... I'd never run away with money...`
` ...Ooohhh, I'd never do iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`Rosa's once-frigid face was filled with rage.`
` The two howling people pointed their guns at each other, shouting insults at each other......`
` You could smell the gold room's reaper slinking closer.`
` The smell of gunpowder, the explosive smell of death, ......filled the room......`
`*drip*.`
` A bubble of blood dripped from Rosa's mouth.`
` Then, ......she fell over lifelessly, like a mannequin.`
`"......E, ......Eva......?!"`
`"I, ......i, it wasn't me!`
` I swear I didn't even pull the trigger?!"`
`".........Eva nee-san, you just shot Natsuhi-san, so your gun wasn't loaded, right...?`
` You never reloaded, so even if you pull the trigger, that gun wouldn't kill anyone.`
` Have no fear."`
`As Kyrie said this, she maneuvered the lever action with a practiced hand, and a smoke-smelling shell casing was ejected...`
` It hit the floor with a small, metallic sound.`
` That tiny sound had a disturbing ring to it...`
`"Rosa-san's analysis was a little naive.`
` ......She has no idea how difficult it would be `
`to exchange this many unmarked gold ingots for money."`
`"......Dad just used it as show money to gain confidence, and that was enough to create the rumor called the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold.`
` ......It's impossible to exchange this for cash.`
` A pile of gold you can't use is no better than a pile of crap."`
`"'10 tons of gold were exchanged for cash on the black market, and the successor and his wife died mysterious deaths'.`
` Expecting that to go unnoticed is what's really impossible.`
` ......We don't want to get the police involved.`
` We'll blow up this island and destroy all the evidence.`
` If it's tough parting with the gold, feel free to grab a few ingots.`
` The billion yen on the cash card is more than enough.`
` ......In other words, Eva nee-san was right."`
`"I, .........I'm glad...`
` ......It looks like we're on the same page......`
` ...I, if the police get involved, who knows what might happen?`
` It's the same with cashing in the gold.`
` I'm sure they'd have used that to trip us up. There's nothing we could have done to make it work...!!"`
`"The 1 billion that woman over there exchanged for cash is the only money we can get our hands on!`
` And even splitting that billion, it'll be more than enough for what we need...!`
` On top of that, now that Rosa is dead, our shares have increased even more...!`
` We can each leave this island with 500 million...!"`
`"Exactly.`
` As long as we don't let our greedy desire to cash in the gold control us,`
` ......we can pretend that everything that occurred on this island never happened.`
` We have a way to do that right here."`
`There was no longer any reason to worry about accidental discharges or people being shot to death on this island.`
` Everything would be erased equally by the explosion accident.`
` No matter what happened between now and midnight the next day, everything would be rewritten by the explosion accident.`
`"......And you told me......to turn myself in?! Stupid Rosa...!`
` You weren't satisfied with just 300 million?`
` This is what you get for being too greedy......`
` Y, ...you got nothing more than you deserved......"`
`"But Kyrie-san, ......there was no need to shoot her, right......?`
` Even Rosa-san would've figured it out if you'd just told her......"`
`"I did need to shoot her.`
` After all, Rosa-san's the only one who didn't fire her gun."`
`"......What does that matter...?"`
`"The guns lying at your feet are Krauss nii-san's and Eva nee-san's.`
` Both of those have been fired.`
` However, Rosa-san's gun can shoot if you just pull the trigger.`
` It's hard to reload one of these if you aren't used to a lever action.`
` An amateur couldn't do it."`
`"Kyrie-san, what are you talking about......?"`
`"Y, ...you......!!"`
`They finally realized what Kyrie meant.`
`'Rosa had the only gun that could still fire, so I shot her first'.`
` Oh, how foolish we were... Why didn't we realize sooner? `
`We should have realized that there's a mechanism for erasing everything that happens on this island...`
` Eva and Hideyoshi hurried to pick up the guns that lay at their feet.`
` At the same time, fire spat from Kyrie's gun once more.`
` Hideyoshi let out a short scream, clutched at his chest, and fell over face-down.`
`"Dear?!`
` Dear...!! `
`......Wah, ......why is this-"`
`Eva fiddled with the lever action, trying to imitate something she vaguely remembered from a western movie,`
` but something seemed to be caught, and the still-open lever didn't budge.`
`"See?`
` It's pretty hard."`
`"D, ......dear......!!!"`
`Kyrie finished reloading with a fluid motion.`
` The way she held it was as innocent and sure as a kid playing with a squirt gun.`
` With another heartless cry of gunfire, the puppet called Eva slumped down to the floor`
` like a puppet with its strings cut......`
`"......Rudolf-san.`
` The billion yen card."`
`"Sure......"`
`The cash card with a billion yen, which Eva had just grabbed from the witch.`
` That alone was worth more than enough.`
` Because of the 20 billion yen pile of gold, everyone's sense of value has been skewed.`
` Just a few million yen is enough for people to kill over.`
` And this was a billion yen.`
`"Rosa-san.`
` Those were some famous last words there.`
` 'Just 300 million'?`
` ......You were too greedy."`
`"Heheh......`
` No doubt.`
` ......Ah, lucky me.`
` I don't have to fish through her corpse."`
`As Rudolf walked up to Eva's body, he found the card lying beside it...and picked it up.`
`"So, this thin, little card is worth a billion yen...`
` ......It'd be pointless to keep the company going.`
` Shall we close up shop and spend the rest of our lives in some southern country?"`
`"That would just get boring.`
` Also, I like seeing you get all worried about some problem, then play around like a little kid when you finally overcome it."`
`"Heheheh...!`
` Sure you do..."`
`"Thank you, Ms. Golden Witch.`
` ......Rudolf-san and I will make good use of this billion."`
`"............"`
`"Krauss nii-san promised to treat you in a gentlemanly fashion.`
` But I haven't made any such promise."`
`......She pulled the trigger without a trace of mercy.`
` When the ringing of the gunfire died down, ......blood trickled from the witch's mouth, and she fell over onto the bed.`
` Once again, Kyrie ejected the used shell casing.`
` The four metal sounds of used shells hitting the floor seemed to symbolize the fact that Rudolf and his wife now possessed all shares of the gold......`
`"......All of them were really slow-witted......`
` ......From the moment they heard about the bomb, they should've known that they wouldn't be leaving this island as a big, happy family."`
`"Sorry 'bout this, Aniki, Aneki, Rosa.`
` ......Well, that's just how the cookie crumbles.`
` Give me a break, okay?`
` Aniki and Aneki get into a fight, Rosa gets dragged in,`
` and I'm the one who picks up the pieces.`
` ......Just the same way it's always been, right?"`
`At the start, Rudolf and Kyrie hadn't planned to kill everyone and take everything for themselves.`
` Kyrie had quickly realized by the size of the gun in her hands that it would probably hold five rounds at a time.`
`.........Yes.`
` Both Kyrie and Rudolf knew a lot about these guns.`
` Rudolf, who had gotten his interest in guns from western movies from his Father, owned a shotgun of a similar design.`
` Since Kyrie had the same skill at handling firearms, they both knew enough about these guns......to enjoy shooting together...`
` Including the witch, there had been eight people there.`
` Six people besides the two of them.`
` Each gun held five rounds.`
` ......That was one short.`
` They didn't have enough to kill everyone.`
`"......I was honestly surprised when they got into a fight and one of the guns went off."`
`That coincidental accident......had provided the missing bullet.`
` It wasn't the second shot.`
` The very first shot, which had accidentally killed Natsuhi, had guaranteed the result of this massacre...`
` In this smoke and corpse-filled room of gold, the two of them wore easygoing smiles, hardly any different from the ones they usually wore...`
`"......What `
`do we do now?"`
`Rudolf picked up Rosa's gun.`
` Then, he fired a test shot at the wall and ejected the old shell with a smooth motion like Kyrie's.`
` Kyrie went to the box of bullets on the table, casually picked up a few, and loaded them one after another into her gun.`
`"Set the bomb switch to 'on'.`
` Then, we just need to wait 24 hours."`
`"The others'll get worried when they realize everyone's missing in the morning."`
`"Then we just need to make sure no one gets worried."`
`"Guess so.`
` ......What about Battler?"`
`"He's your son.`
` Not mine."`
`"Don't say that.`
` Look how attached he is to you.`
` He really respects you."`
`"Then think of a clever way to trick him.`
` I'll worry about Ange.`
` You worry about Battler-kun.`
` Fair enough?"`
`"Nn, ......sure."`
`"I'm kind to my own children,`
` ......but it's a real pain to be nice to Asumu-san's kid.`
` You understand, I hope?"`
`"............"`
`Kyrie's voice had grown cold.`
` Kyrie had acted warmly towards Battler because that had been the adult thing to do.`
` He was Rudolf's son, so she just tried to avoid being unkind.`
` But underneath, he was the son of Asumu, the woman she hated even after the other's death.`
` Now that she had given birth to Ange and finally built up a new family, `
`.........was Battler's return really such a happy thing for her......?`
`"Get yourself ready.`
` Now that we've come this far,`
` ......we can only go for the billion yen or die trying.`
` If you can't convince Battler-kun, I'm sorry, but I won't be taking any chances."`
`"......No need to threaten me.`
` I'll take care of it.`
` I'll find a good story to tell him."`
`"Make sure you do a good job of it.`
` ......If Ange hears that Battler-kun has died in an accident, I'm sure she'll be very sad."`
`"Sure......`
`............`
` ...How do we start?"`
`"We have nothing to gain by waiting for morning.`
` Now is the best time."`
`"......Oh, wonderful.`
` Not even time for a break."`
`"......A test?`
` What is he thinking?`
` At this time of night?`
` Right now?"`
`Battler yelled wildly into the receiver.`
` When he said 'at this time of night', George and Jessica turned to look.`
` According to the clock, it was just past midnight.`
` It might be a normal time to be told to brush their teeth and go to bed, but they couldn't understand what this test was all about.`
`"Okay, I'll hand it over. `
`......Here, George-aniki.`
` It's my dad."`
`"......Hello, `
`this is George speaking."`
`"Ah, hey, George-kun.`
` Sorry to call so late.`
` You weren't sleeping already, were you?`
` You're all still up chatting away, right?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` Maria-chan is sleeping, ......oh, wait, looks like she just woke up. `
`So, what did you want to talk about?`
` Battler-kun said something about a test..."`
`"Yep.`
` Dad can be such a pain sometimes.`
` He suddenly came down from his room.`
` A bunch of stuff happened, and he suddenly started talking about which grandchild would make the best successor."`
`"......But isn't Krauss oji-san the successor?"`
`"He says that none of us are good enough to be the successor.`
` ......So, he's talking about skipping us adults and choosing one from you grandchildren instead.`
` It's really shaken us up, having this forced on us all of a sudden. `
`Aniki and the others are all arguing about it across the room.`
` Maybe you can hear Aneki's shrill voice leaking through across the phone."`
`"I, ......is that so?`
` If that's what Grandfather says, then there's no way around it, I guess...`
` In that case, what should we do?"`
`"He says he wants to call you out one by one, starting with Jessica-chan. `
`......Oh, wait a sec. `
`............`
`......Okay, you still there?`
` Looks like George-kun and Jessica-chan will be the first up to bat.`
` He wants Jessica-chan to go to the parlor in the mansion.`
` You're supposed to go out by the chapel."`
`"It's so sudden, I hardly feel ready......`
` What sort of test is it?"`
`"It looks like Dad's made some sort of crazy quiz.`
` ......Some weird questions about what it means to be the Head."`
`Of course, George felt as though something wasn't right.`
` However, Kinzo was famous for doing radical things on a whim.`
` ......Even this strange test seemed plausible once he heard that it was a sudden idea of Kinzo's.`
`......But even in that case, if he wanted to test them one by one, why wouldn't he call them out one by one? `
`They should just have to wait in the reception room and go when they were called.`
` Why would two people be called to different places at the same time?`
` The plan didn't seem to make sense, which made George feel as though he was missing something.`
`"Still, I wonder why he wanted you to go to the chapel, of all places.`
` ......It seems your grandfather expects a lot from you.`
` I'm not sure what it is, but I think he wants to talk to you about something alone."`
`"......Grandfather...wants to talk to me?"`
`"I wonder what it is.`
` After all, you are the most accomplished of all his grandchildren.`
` Is there something he wants to tell you in particular?`
` ......Well, anyway, that's what he says.`
` Get over there right away.`
` I'm also supposed to go there.`
` Let's get this over with.`
` We'll both catch cold if we keep this up."`
`".........Is that so? `
`I see.`
` Then I'll head towards the chapel.`
` Jessica-chan will go to the parlor.`
` ......Okay.`
` I'll see you in a bit, then."`
`Just what sort of test...what sort of private conversation could Kinzo want to have at this time of night? `
`However, it was a well-known fact that Kinzo didn't have very long to live.`
` It was conceivable that he wanted to give some sort of will to each of his descendants individually...`
` Inside George's mind, the faint feeling that something was wrong was replaced by curiosity...and a desire to meet Kinzo directly and hear the details.`
` George set down the receiver and quickly explained to the others.`
`"It's as you heard.`
` .........Grandfather says he wants to give us all some kind of test."`
`"Uu-?`
` A test...?"`
`"After hiding in his study all these years, he suddenly decides to give us a test this late at night? `
`......Damn that old geezer.`
` What's he thinking?"`
`"It seems our parents feel the same way.`
` It sounds as though they're very worked up about it."`
`"Well, I doubt getting worked up about it will change Grandfather's mind any."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......We might as well accept it.`
` It's Grandfather's order, after all.`
` Let's obey it. `
`......To start, Jessica-chan and I are being called out.`
` I'm going to the chapel.`
` Jessica-chan is supposed to go to the parlor in the mansion."`
`"What about Maria and me?"`
`"I think they'll call about you later.`
` You can wait here."`
`"Uu-!`
` A midnight test! `
`What could it be?!`
` What kind of test is it?!`
` A quiz?`
` A puzzle?`
` I'm really good at wolves and sheep puzzles!`
` Uu-!"`
`Maria, who was now fully awake, seemed to be very excited about this unexpected midnight test.`
`"Then we'll just hang out here."`
`"Yes.`
` Okay, I'm going.`
` I think they're already waiting for us."`
`"......So, he's making one of his grandkids the successor. `
`Sounds just great for me.`
` Now I can let one of you guys deal with it!"`
`"I'm gonna become the successor!`
` I wanna do it!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!"`
`"Ahaha.`
` It'd be fun to have Maria as the successor."`
`"Bye.`
` See you later."`
`Rudolf put down the receiver and stood up.`
`"Okay. `
`......Guess I'm going to the chapel.`
` It's damn cold out there. `
`......Gohda-san. `
`Have some coffee waiting for me when I get back, will you?"`
`Next to Rudolf, ......Gohda was lying face-up.`
` His face was covered by a crossword puzzle book.`
` However, its pages were stained with blood, and you didn't need to move the book to imagine how he had met his pitiful end...`
`"How was it?`
` A nice script, don't you think?"`
`"Yep.`
` We should be thanking Dad.`
` If we just say it was him being fickle, no one will doubt us."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Then, let's split up.`
` ......I'll take care of Jessica-chan.`
` You take care of George-kun."`
`"You got it.`
` ......Let's get this over with quickly, then relax with some coffee."`
`"There won't be any problems, yes?`
` ......No sudden pangs of conscience?"`
`Kyrie smiled coldly......`
` It probably would have been safer to call them out one by one and finish them off together.`
`......However, Kyrie had chosen to have her husband work separately.`
` She wanted to measure Rudolf's resolve.`
` If she was the only one who got her hands dirty, and Rudolf just watched, his heart would not be as dedicated to this venture.`
` By having him dirty his own hands, she could make him truly determined to see this thing through.`
`......Kyrie understood this sort of mind game better than anyone else.`
` Rudolf reflexively averted his gaze from the cold glint in her eyes, but then he just shrugged and answered her question.`
`"Of course.`
` .........We have a billion yen riding on this.`
` I'm a man.`
` I'm not going to miss a chance that'll never come again in my lifetime."`
`"......I expected no less of you, Rudolf-san.`
` ......I love people who seize chances when they come.`
` That's why I love you."`
`"Th, thanks......`
` I'm glad."`
`"Rudolf-san."`
`"What......?"`
`"Stay like that......always, okay?"`
`"Huh?`
` What did you say?"`
`"Always remain the same Rudolf-san I love, `
`......okay?"`
`"......Of course.`
` When have I ever let you down? `
`......Instead of that, you should be worrying more about the kind of champagne we'll use to toast our victory."`
`"I'll do that. `
`.........Take care, now.`
` If you really treasure Battler-kun, don't kill George-kun in front of the chapel, okay?`
` It'll be a pain if he finds the body."`
`"......Yeah, I know.`
` ......I'll lure him away somehow. `
`It's raining outside.`
` Should be some way to do it."`
`"And you aren't a villain in some old western, got it?`
` Don't grant any last requests or take down any final messages, okay?"`
`Kyrie lifted up her gun again and pulled on the lever.`
`......To eject the casing from the bullet she had killed Gohda with.`
`".........Dear......`
` ......Deeeeeeeeear...`
` Waaaaaaahhhhh......"`
`Eva was holding Hideyoshi's body and crying.`
` She hadn't been shot at all.`
` The bullet had scraped against the side of her head......and missed.`
` She hadn't been playing dead.`
` She really thought that she had been shot.`
` When Kyrie's gun spat fire, Eva felt something swift and fierce scrape past her head...`
` before feeling light-headed and fainting.`
` Then, later on, she woke up in the now silent room of the gold.`
` The remains of her beloved husband lay beside her.`
` And Krauss, Natsuhi, and Rosa's corpses.`
` It was a room of death and piled up bodies......`
` When she had cried all she could over Hideyoshi's body,`
` ......she realized that she still had something she needed to do.`
`"......George is in danger......`
` ......George......George......!"`
`They're trying to use the bomb to blow up everything, to bury this whole island with an 'explosion accident'.`
`......Of course.`
` As Eva had expected, the switch on the clock was set to the right, which meant that it was active.`
` Eva moved to flip it to the left......and stopped.`
` That's right.`
` As long as this switch points to the right, ......everything that happens will disappear in this night of illusions.`
` Yes, this is an illusion.`
` No matter what happens tonight, everything will become muddled and hidden away.`
`"They're probably going to kill everyone else.`
` That has to be it... I'm sure of it...!"`
`When she looked at the table with the box of bullets,`
` she saw signs that they had roughly removed the bullets from the box.`
` It clearly showed......that they planned to use that many bullets.`
`......I have to fight.`
`......If only to protect just the life of my precious son......`
` The gun that I dropped when I was shot is stuck with the lever handle open.`
` No matter how hard I pull, it won't open any further, and it won't close again.`
`......Apparently, a bullet has gotten jammed, breaking it.`
`......It's just as Kyrie said.`
` Loading a bullet is tough if you aren't used to it.`
`"Please, `
`dear......`
` Lend me your strength......`
` ......Lend me your strength...`
` so that I can protect George......"`
`In Hideyoshi's hand was Krauss's gun, which he had been trying to pick up.`
` Eva took it, ......prayed to her husband one more time, and tugged on the lever handle.`
`......With a light metallic sound, `
`......the golden casing spun through the air...`
` and bounced off the ground.`
` When she timidly tried to push the lever back, `
`......this time it returned to its original place without any resistance.`
`......There was another metallic clang.`
` It was the sound of a new bullet being loaded......`
`"......Hmph.`
` I figured it'd be something like this.`
` ......Someone's scheming to show me the game that'd disgust me most, so they can laugh at me...."`
`In the games so far, various people have been suspected of being the culprit or an accomplice.`
` The only difference now was that Rudolf and Kyrie were those suspects...`
` However, that was the most aggravating development possible for Ange.`
`"............"`
`Even Lion was full of painful thoughts.`
` Though the solving of the epitaph, which was supposedly the only miracle that could lead to a game with no victims, had occurred,`
` ......how ironic that the tragedy was not averted.`
` Does this mean that we aren't allowed to have a future where we all happily return from this island alive,`
` ......even if the epitaph is miraculously solved before the crime occurs...? `
`A miracle certainly will not occur.`
`......Those words, which I had heard in one of the Fragments Bernkastel had shown me, raced through my mind......`
`"Bernkastel-san......`
` You showed me how wonderful my world was...`
` ......I don't want to believe that you created this tale just to hurt Ange......"`
`"......By now, even I realize that you're the Game Master here.`
` ......Please, tell me.`
` ...Why are you showing us this game...?"`
`Of course, no one answered Lion's muttered question.`
` The game created to mock Ange continued emotionlessly,`
` ......with more terrible twists that didn't betray anyone's expectations anymore......`
`"Ha!`
` Show whatever terrible game you like!`
` You're trying to say that this is one of the endless possibilities inside the cat box, right?!`
` Just do whatever you want...!`
` I won't let something like this get to me!!`
` Someday, I'll find out the truth of what happened on October 5th, 1986!!"`
`After meeting Kyrie in the parlor, Jessica was told that the test would be held in the dining hall, and she followed Kyrie there...`
`".........Kyrie oba-san, there's no one here."`
`"He'll be here soon.`
` Sit over there."`
`"............"`
`Jessica sat in that chair, looking nervous and agitated.`
` Kyrie was by far the calmer of the two.`
` Kyrie closed the door behind her, revealing the gun that rested behind it.`
` Jessica was facing the other way, so she saw nothing......`
`"......Did you hear anything, Kyrie oba-san?`
` You know what kind of test this is?"`
`"Yes.`
` It'll be over soon."`
`"I sure hope so."`
`As she complained, Jessica turned her head around, and the tip of her nose bumped into cold metal.`
`"............Huh-"`
`"R, Rudolf oji-san......?!`
` What......are you doing......?"`
`"Heheh.`
` Just can't bring myself to shoot you in the back."`
`"......C, careful, guns are dangerous.`
` What on Earth are you doing...?!"`
`"I'll give you two guesses about why someone'd point a gun and pull the trigger."`
`Rudolf reloaded rapidly and pulled the trigger again without any sign of hesitation.`
` As the sound of gunfire thundered through the rain, George grabbed at his side and fell to his knees...`
`"Unnggg......ggnhh......!!"`
`"That's weird.`
` Looks like it shoots low.`
` ......This gun's really got it bad."`
`"S, somebody......!!`
` Help me, ...Rudolf oji-san is......!!"`
`George started stumbling away, still clutching at his side.`
` His voice as he called for help was weak and thin.`
` In comparison, Rudolf, who stood behind him, looked perfectly calm as he fiddled with his gun.`
`"......It hurts... ...It hurts...`
` ...Gah, ......nngg...!"`
`It felt to George as though something was tearing into his side.`
` It was so painful that he could barely stand and walk......`
` He leaned against the trunk of a tree.`
` After he crouched down, trying to cover his wound, ......he was no longer able to stand back up.`
` George didn't have a clue what was going on.`
` However, he had thought it strange the whole time.`
` Of course it was strange that he should be called out to a place like this at a time like this.`
`......And yet, `
`......how could he have guessed that something was wrong...? `
`After all,`
` ......his own uncle...`
` had told him that his grandfather was calling for him from the family conference.`
` ......How could he have gotten suspicious......?`
`"......Sorry 'bout this, George-kun. `
`It hurts, doesn't it?`
` If I knew it'd be like this, it'd have been more merciful to blow your brains out from behind.`
` I thought it'd be too cruel to finish you off before you knew what hit you, but it looks like I got it backwards."`
`".........Wh, `
`......why, `
`Rudolf oji-san......?`
` Why would...`
`...my kind uncle...`
` do...`
` this.........?"`
`"Forget about this.`
` By tomorrow night, all of it won't have happened."`
`With a quick use of the lever handle, he loaded another bullet.`
` The casing of the bullet that had pierced George's side fell heartlessly in front of him...`
`"Everyone's gonna die in a sudden, unfortunate accident.`
` Until that moment, we'll all be a big, happy family. `
`......That's how it's gonna be.`
` So don't worry about this.`
` Forget it all."`
`Of course, George didn't have a clue what Rudolf was talking about.`
` All he knew was that Rudolf wanted to kill him, and that he showed no trace of hesitation...`
`......The image George had of Rudolf as the ideal cool, joke-loving adult...`
` didn't match up with the Rudolf standing in front of him, holding a gun.`
` No, maybe it doesn't fit because it fits too well.`
` Even though he has that same smile, as though he's about to tell some hilarious joke,`
` ......he's pointing a gun at me.`
`......Why would that kind, `
`...funny Rudolf oji-san...`
`......do this......? `
`It made him feel unimaginably sad, ......and tears flowed from his eyes.`
`"Uu, ......uuuuuu......Rudolf oji-san......`
` But I......admired you so much......"`
`"Haven't I always told you, George-kun?`
` ......Make sure you don't end up as an adult like me. `
`Now you see.`
` In the next world, make learning how to spot evil your first priority.`
` ......I know you can do it.`
` After all, it's just another kind of studying."`
`"Uu...*hic*......gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"`
`He bit down the pain in his side.`
` ......With the last of his strength, George threw his whole body into a roundhouse kick.`
` At the same time, fire spat from Rudolf's gun.`
`......The bullet pierced George's chest.`
` George spun around as he fell amidst an outpouring of blood.`
` He moaned wordlessly, clenching blood-stained teeth.`
` A frigid gun was pressed harshly against his temple.`
`"So long.`
` ......Go become a great man in the next world.`
` Don't get blinded by money like me."`
`"......I can't believe...`
`...that my uncle...`
`...would kill for money......`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhh........."`
`"You're so innocent.`
` ......People can kill...`
` over money."`
`The ruthless trigger forestalled any further questions.`
` George's hands, which had been covering his wound, dropped lifelessly......`
` When Rudolf saw the last glimmer of life leave him, he sighed deeply and looked tired.`
`"Heh, ......hahahahahahahahahaha.`
` .........That was easier than I'd thought."`
`Rudolf looked up into the dark, rainy sky, the rain drops hitting him full in the face,`
` ......and laughed with an indescribable expression, his tongue hanging out.`
`"I figured there'd be more pangs of conscience than that.`
` ......Now that it's over, it was pretty easy."`
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`gahahahahahaha.`
` Rudolf laughed.`
` This was probably just the thing Kyrie had hoped for.`
` It had taken some effort to kill George.`
`......Though he had been merciless, the last traces of conscience in Rudolf's heart had probably slowed him down.`
` However, now that he had killed someone with his own hands, a turning point that few people ever reach, ......Rudolf had finally awakened.`
`...No, he finally understood.`
`"......It's no different from squeezing dough out of a group of morons.`
` ......The same old game of musical chairs.`
` If there's a pile of money in front of you, the first one to reach it wins.`
` The slow ones just get kicked down to hell."`
`Haven't I driven dozens of poor fools into debt with my earlier swindles? `
`Several of those probably ended up bankrupt, and some of those might've hanged themselves.`
` And I always laughed, saying that was none of my business.`
` And that's all there is to it.`
` The only difference now is that, for the first time,`
` ......I've dealt the final blow with my own hands.`
`"......Thanks, Kyrie.`
` ......You're always the best at cutting away my naivety.`
` ......Heheheh, ...hehhahahahahahahaahah!`
` Hyahhhahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!!"`
`Rudolf's evil laugh rang out.`
` The laugh was so purely evil it was almost reassuring.`
` The fake evil that covers up pangs of conscience is far more repulsive to behold.`
` If a man commits himself to an evil act, how much more pleasant and graceful it is when the man is wholly devoted to his goal.`
` In that sense, Rudolf's evil smile and laugh truly `
`were pleasant and graceful......`
`......And so.`
` Surely the brutal, bloody stage of the dining hall......was also reassuring.`
` A clang. `
`A thud. `
`A crack, a squish. `
`......A strange mixture of these sounds kept repeating over and over at the same tempo.`
`......Each time, a red splash landed on the nearby dangling tablecloth.`
`"Jessica-chan, .........are you listening......?"`
`Kyrie asked this with the sort of smile any aunt might make to her niece.`
` However, Jessica didn't answer.`
` There was nothing particularly surprising about this.`
`......After all, by now, `
`......her nose was broken, `
`her eyes had been smashed, `
`......her teeth had been knocked out, `
`and not only her nose, but her entire face was now hardly recognizable as a face, `
`......just a lump of bloody flesh......`
` Kyrie finally stopped her task of repeatedly smashing Jessica's face with the stock of her gun.`
` Still sitting on top of Jessica, Kyrie tossed her gun to the side, ......pulled a compact out of her pocket, and looked at her own face in the mirror.`
` Then, finally, ......she realized that her face was covered by speckles of fresh blood.`
`"How terrible.`
` These clothes will have to go too.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`With a muffled laugh, Kyrie shakily rose to her feet.`
` Jessica wasn't moving anymore.`
` ......She had been convulsing a bit until a second ago, but now, she was as still as stone.`
`"......Smashing a woman's face `
`is something your aunt is used to.`
` Sorry about that. `
`......If you hadn't resisted, I could've let you have a much cleaner death."`
`Kyrie pulled the tablecloth off and used it like a towel to wipe the blood from all over her body.`
` However, instead of taking the blood off, it just smeared it around,`
` ......and did nothing to remove the stench of blood and death that covered her.`
` When she got tired of rubbing the tablecloth against the blood, Kyrie walked over to the extension line telephone in the corner of the room.`
` Then, she dialed the number for the cousins' room in the guesthouse......`
`".........Hello.`
` It's me.`
` ......It's Battler-kun's turn now.`
` He's supposed to go to the chapel.`
` .........Yes, that's right.`
` I haven't been given any instructions about Maria-chan.`
` Have her wait there.`
` .........*giggle*.`
` Yes, keep your wits about you.`
` I'm rooting for you to be chosen as the successor, Battler-kun."`
`With the same smile as usual and the partly-wiped splashes of blood still covering her face, ......Kyrie finished her call to Battler.`
` When she set down the receiver, there was a small knock, and Rudolf came back into the room.`
`"......Hey, you look like shit."`
`"Jessica-chan has better reflexes than I gave her credit for.`
` I didn't think she'd be able to fight back from a position like that."`
`"It's a bit of a shame she had to end up looking like this.`
` ......What a waste of a good, Natsuhi-esque woman."`
`"And how about your end?`
` Did he give you much trouble?"`
`"No problems there.`
` Plain and simple."`
`When Kyrie heard Rudolf's instant response, she favored him with an evil smile.`
` Yes, the man she loved was the sort who could do it if he tried, without letting cheap emotions get in the way...`
`"I love you, Rudolf-san.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way."`
`"It's hard to imagine an easier job to net you a billion yen.`
` ......It's like Dad always said.`
` In the life of every man, there comes one day where he has to be willing to kill."`
`"In other words, always be willing to kill if your own survival depends on it.`
` ......That's my favorite line of his."`
`"What's next?`
` My rifle is hungry for blood."`
`"You've got a big job coming up.`
` Convincing Battler-kun."`
`"Ah, that's right.`
` That'll be a pain.`
` Hope I don't have to end it by pulling the trigger."`
`"I've really enjoyed `
`life as a three-person family with Ange. `
`......But, if you really want Battler-kun to join in on that, ......good luck."`
`"Sure.`
` ......I don't think we'll have any complaints from him.`
` Don't worry, I've worked out a scenario to trick him good."`
`"Good luck.`
` Even I hope that Ange's beloved big brother doesn't get caught up in the explosion accident."`
`"I know.`
` Then, I'll head back to the chapel."`
`"Rudolf-san."`
`"What...?"`
`".........If you can't convince Battler-kun..."`
`"............`
`......I know, I know.`
` If that happens, bang."`
`"Battler-kun is independent enough that he left the family out of protest when I married you, remember?`
` ......If you can only convince him halfway, and if things get nasty later on,`
` ......he'll prove fatal to us."`
`"I know.`
` Believe in me."`
`"......And if...`
` If I decide that Battler-kun is growing suspicious, `
`......I'll kill him myself.`
` He's not my kid, after all."`
`"......Yeah,`
` I know. `
`......So, `
`promise me one thing, Kyrie."`
`"What's that...?"`
`"If......I can trick Battler, and the three of us make it off this island..."`
`"......If that happens, what?"`
`"............`
`...Never say that Battler isn't your kid again.`
` ......After all, ......you're his mother.`
` ......Please."`
`"............`
`......Sure, I promise."`
`Kyrie shrugged and answered as she loaded bullets.`
`"You go to the chapel.`
` I'll wait until Battler-kun has left, and then clean up everything inside the guesthouse."`
`"Sure you'll be alright doing that alone?"`
`"And what about you?"`
`Battler left the guesthouse under an umbrella.`
` He had been called to the area in front of the chapel, just like George had been.`
` Not even 30 minutes had passed since the time George and Jessica had been called out.`
`......Apparently, this test didn't last too long.`
`"......Damn geezer.`
` First you never come out, not even for lunch, and then you show up in the middle of a night with a test. `
`......I'll bet living as a shut-in's got his sense of day and night all backwards."`
`Complaining all the way, Battler strolled off into the rain.`
` Almost immediately, he was swallowed up by the darkness of the rose garden and passed out of sight......`
`.........And then...`
` Kyrie could be seen coming out from the darkness of the rose garden.`
` Her right hand held a gun.`
` Her left an umbrella.`
` Her inner pocket contained the master key ring she had stolen from Gohda.`
` Her right pocket had a handful of bullets.`
` Her left held a knife she had taken from the kitchen.`
` She was a carefully and perfectly outfitted murderer.`
` Another bolt of lightning struck down from the swirling skies.`
` It lit up only half of Kyrie's face.`
` Her cheek......was still covered with Jessica's blood......`
` Under the eaves, Kyrie folded up her umbrella, smiled, and spoke to no one.`
`"How's it going, everyone?"`
`Rudolf could be seen under the eaves of the chapel.`
` He had hidden his gun in the nearby shadows and was now smoking a cigarette...`
`"......Should be easy to trick that dimwit.`
` ......And if it doesn't work, that's just too bad."`
`He glanced over at the place he had stowed his gun.`
` The cigarette smoke began to pleasantly cloud his mind.`
`......Battler isn't a kid anymore.`
` He's an adult, who can choose his path through life as he pleases.`
` When animals grow up, it's normal for them to form a group and go on a journey.`
` Humans are the only ones that keep treating them like kids even after they get big......`
`"......If I'd known it'd come to this,`
` I should never have begged for you to come back.`
` ......I regret......dragging you back into the family......"`
`He puffed out those words...`
`...along with the smoke.`
` When Battler came, he didn't intend to voice those regrets of his.`
` Rudolf had already determined to play the part of the evil murderer who kills for money......`
`"......He's still not here.`
` ......What's taking him so long?"`
`At that moment, he heard the sound of someone stepping on gravel.`
` He looked up, thinking that Battler had finally arrived, ......but the sound had come from the direction opposite of the mansion.`
`"............!"`
`"......Rudolf......`
` ...How could you...`
` do that...to my husband......?!!"`
`"Aneki... So, you're alive......"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but I lived... `
`Too bad!`
` But my husband wasn't so lucky... `
`How could you...`
` How could you...?!!"`
`With a face obscured by anger and tears, Eva slowly walked closer, her gun raised.`
` Her husband had been killed right in front of her.`
` She probably wouldn't even hesitate.`
` Realizing that a gun, quivering with anger, was pointed right at his chest, Rudolf backed away.`
` As he pretended to back away, ......he approached the gun he had hidden in the shadows.`
`"C, calm down, Aneki......`
` Put the gun down...`
` ......I never wanted that to happen.`
` Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do...!"`
`"How can you say such half-baked lies?!!"`
`As Eva had said, it really had been a half-baked, pointless thing to say.`
` Rudolf would have said anything if he thought it would calm Eva's emotions before she pulled the trigger, which she looked capable of doing at any moment now...`
`......Then, Rudolf's foot came in contact with his gun.`
`"L, let's just talk this over.`
` ......George-kun should be here soon. `
`......Oh.`
` ...Hey, George-kun, we're over here."`
`Rudolf waved, as though George was coming from behind Eva.`
` Let Eva's attention turn in that direction......`
`......That idiot.`
` My simple, big sister has always been a sucker.`
` Die!!! `
`Gunfire. `
`......Then, a bit later, the sound of something heavier than rain drip-dropping onto the cobblestone floor.`
`".........Agh, `
`.........nggg......"`
`"......Rudolf...`
` I've always been able to see through your tricks...!!"`
`The bullet Eva fired went straight into Rudolf's chest.`
` The bullet Rudolf fired at Eva missed, landing near her feet.`
`"Guess I was...right... `
`This gun...`
` does shoot `
`low......"`
`He dropped the gun into a puddle with a splash, staggered backwards, and leaned against the wall of the chapel.`
`"Nah, that's not it......`
` ......All good westerns end......with the bad guy's bullet missing......"`
`Eva dashed up to him, kicked away the gun that had fallen into a puddle, and grabbed Rudolf by the collar.`
`"What about George?!`
` Where is he?!`
` I won't let you kill him...!!"`
`".........Sorry, Aneki.`
` ......Already...got him."`
`"Liar!!"`
`"......Did it in the bushes over there.`
` ......Go take a look.`
` You'll see soon......"`
`"............R, `
`......Rudolf......`
`...you............"`
`Eva, who said she had always been able to see through her little brother's tricks,`
` ......also knew that Rudolf's final words, as his consciousness began to fade thanks to the bullet wound, were not a lie.`
`"How could you...... George...Geoooooooooooooooooorrge!!!"`
`An empty shell casing bounced off the cobblestone.`
` The furious gun barrel was pressed against Rudolf's forehead.`
`"......Go ahead and shoot.`
` ......I doubt that'll bring you much peace though."`
`A bolt of lightning turned everything white.`
` However, the wall of the chapel was stained blood red.`
` A red splash, like a crushed tomato, came out from the back of Rudolf's head and covered the wall......`
` Then, leaving a red trail behind him, `
`......Rudolf sagged downwards, `
`sat on the ground, and fell over.`
`"George, Geooooooooorge!!`
` Geooooooooorge, uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`Eva dashed off towards the bushes.`
` ......She found George's corpse almost immediately, screamed, and broke down sobbing.`
`......Rudolf's bloody corpse was exposed to the rain that ran down off the eaves.`
` His eyes were still wide open.`
` A fist-sized, flesh-covered hole was open in the back of his head, ......and his insides were exposed to the open air.`
` Inside was a mixed jelly of flesh, brains, and spinal fluid.`
` That goop, which looked like someone had mixed it up with a spoon, dripped from his eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the hole in his head......`
`"......Dad......Dad......`
` ......Aaaaaaaaahhh...!!!"`
`Ange clutched at her head, sobbing and moaning.`
` Her father had dirtied his hands with murder over money, and on top of that, he had faced such a cruel end, and Ange had been forced to see his corpse.`
` It was hard to imagine a more painful experience for a daughter to go through.`
`......I'm totally fed up with this. It's completely meaningless.`
`"Bernkastel-san...!`
` I know you're here somewhere!`
` Please, make this game stop...!!`
` There's no point to it!"`
`As if in answer to that yell, ......a black shadow appeared a few seats in front of them.`
` Or perhaps she had been sitting there the whole time.`
` Maybe we just couldn't see her until we realized she was there.`
` It was, without a doubt, the back of Bernkastel's head.`
`"Bernkastel-san......!!"`
`"......Pipe down back there.`
` Can't you watch the show quietly?"`
`The witch turned around with bored eyes.`
` ......As though the two who were yelling were the strange ones.`
`"Please stop this...!`
` We realize that this world is the sealed cat box world of October 4th and 5th...!"`
`The games are like messages.`
` Or maybe more like a roundabout love letter.`
` A single message can be conveyed over several games.`
` But now, we understand.`
` We know that endless tales can seep out of the sealed, two-day cat box.`
` And beyond that, I even know the culprit and the motive.`
` That has already been revealed, and it has nothing to do with this game.`
`"We both know the answer, that this is a cat box tale...!`
` So, there shouldn't be any need for any further games...!!`
` If this is supposed to be a game between you and us, then we already know the answer...!!`
` The game should be over!!"`
`"Just shut up already.`
` Didn't you hear Bern tell you to be quiet?"`
`Another shadow appeared in the next seat over, turned around, and scolded the pair.`
`".........There is a point.`
` If you just watch, you'll see it.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Are you the Game Master...?!"`
`"......Not at all."`
`"Then who is it?!`
` Could it be......Clair...?"`
`"If you watch, you'll see.`
` Not much longer now.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"The tragedy has already reached its climax.`
` Who'll survive, I wonder?`
` Eheheheheheheheheh......"`
`Bernkastel isn't the Game Master...? `
`Then who is? `
`Could Clair have created this cruel tale......? `
`Or are there even more witches playing around with this cat box......? `
`The guesthouse......was wrapped in silence.`
` There were no sounds.`
` No trace of anyone's presence.`
` No breathing from anyone alive.`
` There wasn't anything to be heard anymore......`
` If there was a sound...`
` Then that would be only the sound of the murderer's feet stepping across the floor......`
` Kyrie slowly passed through the lounge.`
` In her right hand...was a gun.`
` In her left hand...was a knife.`
` The knife was stained with blood, and some was still dripping from the tip,`
` ......leaving behind red tracks like a demon's footprints......`
` Her hands were filled with tools of murder.`
` So, she wasn't capable of doing anything but murder.`
` In that sense, she was clearly 100% 'murderer' at that moment.`
`......The murderer reached the front door, and then, finally, she looked down at her blood-stained hands.`
` Those hands carried tools of death, which had performed a cruel massacre.`
` Then, at last, the murderer realized that she couldn't even open the door like this, and threw away the knife in her left hand...`
` Then, she placed her hand on the door, turned around calmly, ......and spoke.`
`"Sorry, everyone.`
` ......But don't worry.`
` A few days later, the newspapers will be talking about an unfortunate accident.`
` ......And I'm sure the news shows, newspapers, and all the rumor-spreading people will be sure that you spent your time in happy ignorance until the instant of the accident. `
`......In other words, that'll mean you all had a good time until midnight on October 5th."`
`So said the one who had stained the guesthouse red.`
`"At this hour, the cousins are all staying up late and playing around.`
` ......The servants who have the morning shift are all snoring.`
` The ones on the late shift are probably filling in the log or taking a break about now."`
`"......That's how it is.`
` From where I am now, I can hear the laughter coming from the cousins' room. `
`............*giggle*."`
`Humans outside the cat box would probably never understand what Kyrie was saying.`
` Only she, shut inside the cat box of the explosion accident, could understand the true meaning of her words......`
` Outside, the rain poured down heavily.`
` Kyrie almost picked up an umbrella, but then stopped suddenly, as if she'd just thought of something.`
` Then, she started walking out into the rain, not caring at all whether she got wet or not...`
` Did the murderer not want an umbrella to get in the way of pointing her gun?`
` ......Or was she hoping that the rain could act as a shower to get the blood off her?`
`".................."`
`Kyrie stopped walking.`
` As though something unexpected had caught her attention.`
` However, this time, it was no whim of hers......`
`".........How could you...`
`...kill my husband......?!!!"`
`"Oh,`
` ......Eva nee-san. `
`......That's surprising.`
` How could I have missed you from that distance?"`
`"I'm just as surprised.`
` I didn't think I'd survive."`
`"......You came here from the underground stairway behind the chapel, right?`
` ......In that case-"`
`"That's right.`
` I bumped into Rudolf in front of the chapel!"`
`"And how was he doing?"`
`"Oh, just wonderful.`
` It's been a while since we siblings had a nice chat."`
`"............`
`......I see.`
` ......He's such a show-off, but so unreliable in a tight spot.`
` ......Looks like he can't do anything without me after all."`
`Kyrie had already realized that Rudolf had been killed.`
` However, no trace of urgency or panic rose to her face.`
` She just closed her eyes with her usual unconcerned expression,`
` ......and when she opened them again, she had regained her composed smile.`
`"......Thank you.`
` I'm grateful.`
` This way, I can really have everything to myself."`
`"What's that blood on your clothes...?`
` You just came out of the guesthouse, didn't you...... `
`......Don't tell me......"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......I'm in the middle of a murder right now."`
`"You killed?!`
` You killed everyone?!!`
` Even Maria-chan...?!"`
`"There was no need to let them live until morning.`
` When morning came, there would be an uproar, and that could prove to be a pain.`
` They might have used a wireless to contact someone off the island and gotten help. `
`......So, this was clearly the best move to take.`
` If you turn the chessboard around and look at it that way, right......?"`
`"Monster!!`
` I can't believe you're so blinded by greed that you committed murder...!!"`
`"Don't forget what you did yourself."`
`"That was an accident!! `
`I didn't mean to kill them!`
` Unlike you!!"`
`"You're not wrong there.`
` ......If that gun hadn't gone off, you would have kept on arguing and jumping at each other.`
` If you had, then the rest of you would eventually reach the answer a few steps slower than I did."`
`"I'm not a murderer!!"`
`"Not true.`
` You're just a murderer who didn't get a chance.`
` You've just been saved by that accidental discharge.`
` .........If it weren't for that bit of good luck, and if I hadn't moved before you did, `
`......then you would have played the same role I'm playing now.`
` That fact won't go away, no matter how much you try to deny it. It's a truth that exists across all futures."`
`"D, don't try and confuse me!"`
`However, ......on the inside, Eva understood.`
` Back then, she had probably been saved by that accidental discharge, by a coincidence.`
` If the argument had continued much longer, she would surely have grown a desire to kill Krauss and the others, and might even have carried it out.`
`......She simply could not deny the existence of that demon deep within her heart.`
` Only the theatergoers knew.`
` They knew that she could become a killer in another world.`
` And Kyrie, who did not have the theatergoing ability, knew this fact also.`
` ......Apparently, she really was an extraordinary person.`
` So, for some time, Eva could only grind her teeth in silence, still pointing her gun......`
`"......I don't understand.`
` You're also a mother. You've felt the pain of giving birth to your own child.`
` How can you not know how precious a life is...?!`
` How are you capable of doing all this...?!"`
`"To create a child, all you need to do is sleep with someone."`
`"What does that have to do with anything...?!!"`
`"Children are bonds...is what I mean."`
`"What?!"`
`"Children are bonds that can tie you to your husband.`
` ......A bond to make Rudolf-san acknowledge me, so I could take him back from that woman."`
`"But you've killed Rudolf-san now.`
` So, ......you understand what that means, right?"`
`"What do you mean...`
`...I understand?!"`
`"Right now, `
`I'm no man's wife, so there's no need for me to be a mother.`
` ......I am me.`
` Kyrie.`
` Now that Rudolf-san's dead, I'm not even an Ushiromiya anymore.`
` I live to benefit me."`
`"Right, Rudolf is dead, so maybe you aren't a wife anymore.`
` But you still have Ange-chan, right...?!`
` You're still a mother, aren't you...?!"`
`"Didn't you hear what I just said about bonds?`
` Now that Rudolf-san is gone, Ange is of no use to me."`
`"......Y, `
`...you......`
` how can any mother say that about her own daughter?!"`
`"Eva nee-san.`
` Let's put a stop to this.`
` Stop pretending to be so noble."`
`"Pretending...?!"`
`"Did either of us marry because we wanted children?`
` We didn't, right?`
` We married because we wanted to live with the man we loved.`
` And, once you've married, you never want to let that man go, for the rest of your life, correct?`
` Children are weapons to be used for that goal."`
`"Who would have children for a reason like that...?!!"`
`"Some people would."`
`Kyrie kept on speaking emotionlessly, ignoring the falling rain......`
` Her relaxed smile did not falter for an instant.`
`"Ange was just a chain I used to tie Rudolf-san to me.`
` ......Or, you could call her a chess piece, someone to play the role of the kid in our family drama. `
`......To me, Ange was nothing more than a piece, necessary so that I could act the part of the good mother in front of Rudolf-san."`
`"......You... ...Could you say that to Ange-chan's face?!"`
`"Of course, that'd be pointlessly cruel, so I won't say this to her directly.`
` I plan to write her a letter asking her to forgive her bad mother, then vanish from her life.`
` You've seen what Rosa-san and Maria-chan are like, right?`
` Now that Rudolf-san's gone, Ange's just a chain tying me down."`
`"......I'll go back to being just Kyrie, and enjoy the rest of my life at my leisure.`
` A new challenge, and a new life. `
`And maybe even a new love.`
` *giggle*........."`
`"......And you call yourself human......`
` ......You call yourself Ange-chan's mother?!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*. `
`Who gives a damn about Ange?`
` I've never adored `
`that little brat."`
`"......H, ......how can you......"`
`"You've been released from your family drama too, haven't you? `
`Let's sing the praises of a woman's freedom.`
` You should thank me for having George-kun killed for you."`
`"Y, ......you......monsteeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`"Ahhahhahahahahhaaahhhyahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`The two yells...and the sound of gunfire......thundered across the dark rose garden.`
`......Slowly, Eva fell backwards.`
` Then, she landed in a puddle, ......scattering countless drops of water.`
` Across from her, Kyrie spun around as though dancing.`
` Beautiful, black rose petals scattered around her.`
` They were dark red rose petals.`
`......As these rose petals sprayed from her throat, she spun around in a circle,`
` ......and slowly crumpled.`
` Then, she fell to the ground, sending muddy water flying.`
` The two women had shot......and fallen.........`
` However, when the thunder roared, only Eva sat back up...`
`".........*pant*...`
`...*pant*...`
`...*pant*......"`
`Eva hadn't been shot.`
` Kyrie's intensity had made her fall backwards, ......but the bullet had once again slipped right past her......`
` Eva cursed her good luck.`
` Why couldn't this luck have saved her husband or her son?`
`".........Die there......for Ange-chan's sake.`
` .........You'll be killed in the explosion accident.`
` Until the moment of your death, you worried about the daughter you left behind.`
` ......Yes.`
` I'll write that into the lid of the cat box........."`
`"............"`
`When Kyrie heard this, ......blood dripped from her grinning mouth, and she seemed to say something in response.`
` However, her voice came out only as globs of blood from the hole in her throat, not words......`
`"M......`
` Mom......`
` ...Mom...`
` uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh......!`
` It's...`
` a lie... `
`......It's all a lie...!!`
` Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh...!!"`
`"Ange, ...please, calm down...!`
` This is just a game...!`
` That couldn't possibly be what your mother truly feels...!`
` It's just something that the Game Master made Kyrie oba-san's piece say...!!"`
`But saying that did nothing to calm Ange's sobs.`
` I don't blame her.`
` Even if she knows it's just a game, ......she's been forced to see, not only her mother's death, `
`......but also her mother announcing that she was the culprit of a mass murder, who didn't even love her daughter.`
` Anyone would sob after hearing that...`
`"Bernkastel-san!!`
` Enough of this!!`
` I don't care who the Game Master is!!`
` Stop this pointless game right now!!"`
`When Lion yelled this, the theater suddenly went pitch-black, swallowed in darkness.`
` However, that wasn't enough to shock Lion.`
` Lion continued to yell Bernkastel's name into the darkness, telling the witch to stop this game.`
` Then, a single beam of light shone down upon the stage.`
` There was Clair, the one who had appeared for just a second right before this cruel game began.`
`"Clair...!!`
` So, ......you were the Game Master after all?! `
`......I don't get it. Why?!"`
`Clair didn't answer.`
`......In fact, ......it looked as though she hadn't even heard.`
` Her eyes were blank, and you couldn't tell what she was looking at.`
` In fact, she was even forgetting to blink...`
`......She looked......just like a doll......`
` Then, another beam of light lit up the side of the stage.`
` Under that light......stood Bernkastel.`
` At the same time, though there appeared to be no one in the audience, a large applause rang out...`
`"............*giggle*."`
`Bernkastel raised her right hand in response to the applause.`
` She kept doing so until the applause died down......`
`"Bernkastel-san!!`
` So, ......you were the Master of this game after all...!!"`
`"......Lion.`
` How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the Game Master?"`
`"Then are you saying it's Clair?!`
` That's impossible...!!"`
`"Yep.`
` Of course it's impossible.`
` After all, `
`Clair is dead. `
`......We were just conducting her funeral.`
` Did you forget that......?"`
`"Then just who is standing there......?"`
`"A corpse.`
` She's not a mannequin.`
` So, of course, she still has her insides.`
` ......She's hiding it under a beautiful exterior, but she's actually packed full of guts."`
`When Bernkastel raised her right hand, ......a light fell on it, and a black, shining scythe appeared there.`
` It was a cold, merciless, and cruel object, like something a classic grim reaper might hold.`
`"Wh, ......what are you planning to do......?"`
`"......When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle.`
` When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts.`
` Tales are things you get to enjoy twice. `
`......That's what it means to be a witch of theatergoing."`
`Bernkastel pressed the blade of her reaper scythe against Clair's stomach,`
` then slowly slid it across.`
` Then, along the line she traced, Clair's dress was sliced open.`
` It was now clear that the scythe she held was not a fake one for theatrical use.`
` ......And, it was clear just what she planned to do next that made her cruel smile so fitting.`
`"Ange.`
` Can you hear me?"`
`".........I hear you...`
` You tear me to bits, make me read!`
` What's next?!`
` Are you showing me this worst possible tale to hurt me even more?!`
` Is this fun for you?! `
`Yeah, I'll bet it is.`
` I'm just happy with all this too...!`
` You think......that I'd give up after that?!`
` You think...I'll sit around crying any longer because of that disgusting game of yours?!!"`
`"......Both you and Lion...`
` seem to have the wrong idea.`
` I'm not the Game Master.`
` This tale is not one that I created."`
`"Then that woman in the dress is the Game Master?!"`
`"No, she isn't...!`
` That can't be!`
` Then who's the Game Master?!`
` Who created this disgusting tale?!!"`
`"You still don't understand?"`
`"What don't we understand?!!"`
`"Ange.`
` You gambled everything on a faint chance of a miracle, throwing yourself forward.`
` ......I invited you to October 4th and 5th of 1986 out of respect for your courage."`
`"......What was your goal?`
` To take your family back.`
` ......That would be a very difficult thing, and without the blessing of a miracle, a thoroughly impossible one.`
` You were prepared for that, weren't you?"`
`"Yes, I'm prepared...!!`
` And I still haven't given up on Onii-chan, Mom, and Dad!"`
`"Whether you give up or not is your choice.`
` That's your own game, after all.`
` I won't support you, and I won't even watch.`
` I've already enjoyed my fill of games that use you as a piece, so I have no need for you any longer."`
`"Well, that's a relief.`
` Then why am I here?`
` Didn't you invite me?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` I invited you here.`
` ......To thank you for entertaining me for a while, as my piece."`
`"To thank me?!`
` Ha, so this is how witches show gratitude!!`
` Sure, this has been loads of fun, you devil! `
`How could you make this kind...`
` this kind of game...`
`......and do that to Dad and Mom?!!"`
`"Ange.`
` You made a wish, hoping that you could take your family back.`
` However, you made one more wish.`
` Remember?"`
`"No, I don't!!"`
`"You wanted to know what happened on that day."`
`What happened on Rokkenjima on October 4th and 5th, 1986? `
`Didn't Ange leave on her journey with Amakusa because she longed to answer that question?`
`"That's right...... `
`So what's your point?!"`
`"......You don't......mean......"`
`Lion realized what Bernkastel was getting at.`
` And because of that, ......Lion was too shocked to speak......`
` The Game Master isn't Bernkastel or Clair.`
` Then who is it......? `
`That's the wrong question.`
` There is......no Game Master.`
` That could mean only one thing......`
`"Ange.`
` You still don't understand?"`
`"......What......?"`
`"This is the truth.`
` The insides of the cat box of October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
` Afterwards, Eva survived the explosion by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ......And, since she never spoke of the inside of the cat box no matter how much you wanted to know, that truth was shut within the cat box for all eternity."`
`"What......are you saying......?"`
`"Only Eva returned alive.`
` Even though the police claimed it was an accident, the public didn't believe it.`
` Then, she took over her husband's company, and the harder she worked to make it more and more successful, the more enemies she made.`
` A public image of her as a great queen of conspiracy grew stronger and stronger."`
`"......I'm sure she wanted to tell people about the truth.`
` That truth that no one would ever believe without proof.`
` ......Bit by bit, Eva's heart began to snap.`
` You rejected Eva, so she rejected you in turn.`
` The relationship between the last two members of your family was completely strained.`
` Each time she compared you with her beloved son, she grew more and more twisted and broken."`
`Then, a strange message bottle was picked up and became a topic of conversation.`
` It contained a bizarre story, one which told of a mysterious serial murder related to the gold on Rokkenjima.`
` Everyone rejected the explosion accident theory and started to think up conspiracy theories.`
` Some of those theories named Eva as the culprit, which tormented her even more.`
` But Eva used even that to create the cat box.`
` And until the moment of her death, she protected it.`
` She protected the lock that held the cat box shut.`
` So, no human would ever reach the truth inside the cat box.`
` Not unless the witches who crossed the sea of Fragments opened the lock......`
`"This is the truth."`
`".........You're lying...... `
`......You're lying......lying...!!`
` If this really is the truth, you should be able to say that in red!!`
` There's no way you can, of course there isn't!! `
`Nngyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, calm down...!! `
`Uu, ......ah...?!"`
`Ange writhed with such strength that the chains on her arms and legs looked like they might snap.`
` All over her body, ......a red, gooey liquid started to seep out.`
` It was as though cracks had opened up all over her and blood was leaking out of all of them.`
`"What's that?`
` You want me to announce it clearly with the red truth?`
` Then I'll do that, just for you. `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:This is all truth-}`
`}`
`{a:c: `
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`}`
`Ange's yell covered up Bern's red truth.`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, `
`ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Stupid kid.`
` If only you hadn't made me say that, I could've shut it up inside the cat box. `
`But you did tell me to, right?`
` I knew you would, of course.`
` And I so wanted to see you scream like that.`
` ......What a lovely expression, one that'll keep me laughing for about a hundred years. `
`......*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!! `
`Go back to being scrap meat.`
` Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!! `
`Mom, Dad, `
`......it's a lie, right?! `
`Lies, `
`......lies......`
`...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh........."`
`"A, Ange......!`
` Ange......?!"`
`As Ange held her head and screamed, the blood dripping from her finally grew so thick that it started scattering all over the place.`
` Then, bit by bit, her body began to melt...no, to fall apart.`
` Then, bits of her began to pile up on the chair, ......until she was nothing but a pile of guts and scraps......`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahah, aaaahhahahahahaaaaahhaahaha!! `
`Is the truth really such a precious thing?`
` How absurd, how foolish!! `
`Why can't humans control their own truth?`
` They stupidly search for the truth like that's all that matters, and when they finally find it and can't stand it, they turn themselves into scrap meat!!"`
`"Hey, are you watching?`
` Clair?`
` .........You wanted to hide this truth too, didn't you?`
` For fun, you wrote several cat box tales, `
`and planned to seal them in message bottles like the end of a mystery novel you loved. `
`Then, you threw them into the sea.`
` To save those who would suffer if they knew the truth...!!"`
`"You sealed everything in a cat box, and Eva provided the lock.`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` And I've sliced that box open for you...!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahaha, `
`all that effort you spent to hide it has gone to waste!!`
` I've exposed all of the truth you hid with your death!!`
` Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahhahha!!"`
`"Is that......what you've been after?!`
` You did all of this just to insult Clair's death?!!`
` And then...you showed it to Ange to make her suffer...!`
` You really were......an evil witch after all!!"`
`"I've been a witch the whole time.`
` A traveler whose only goal is to escape boredom.`
` ......Care for it and love it while it's alive, then eat the guts when it's dead.`
` That's how witches live!"`
`"I cannot forgive you for what you have done...!!`
` You've hurt Ange and humiliated Clair, ......the person I would become in another world...!!`
` I won't forgive you...!!"`
`"Lion.`
` You are what Clair longs to be.`
` Even after death, she longs for it."`
`"............!"`
`"From the moment that Clair was thrown from the cliff, her fate was already sealed.`
` I'm sure it gave her a little bit of salvation`
` to know that another 'her' lives in happiness in another world."`
`"......That's right.`
` I'm her salvation...!`
` So, I must live life to the fullest...live life for the both of us...!"`
`"Lion.`
` ......Let me show you just a bit more of this tale of the truth."`
`"I'm not interested!"`
`"Don't worry, it'll be very interesting.`
` ......After the duel between Eva and Kyrie, the guesthouse is wrapped in silence. `
`Let me invite you to the parlor at that point in time."`
`"The parlor......?`
` The one in the mansion?"`
`Bernkastel snapped her fingers, and the scene of the mansion's parlor unfolded before them.`
` In the cruel tale they had just been shown, the parlor hadn't been particularly important.`
` Jessica had been summoned to the parlor, but she was then immediately led to the dining hall and killed there.`
` So, there had been nothing in the parlor.`
` And, right now, there was nothing in the parlor that appeared before Lion.`
`"Just what's supposed to be here?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......As you can see, there's nothing here.`
` But watch.`
` I'm about to show you something interesting."`
`"If you call it interesting, that's a sure sign that it isn't."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......Go on, take a look.`
` ......It's right there.`
` Right in that corner."`
`Bernkastel was pointing......at nothing more than a corner of the room.`
` There was nothing there.`
` She had told Lion to look there, so the latter was expecting something terrible to be there,`
` ......but there really was nothing there at all.`
`"............??"`
`"......That's right, there's nothing there.`
` At least, not in this world. `
`But what if we peek into the next Fragment over......?"`
`"............?!"`
`On the white, blank wall...`
` bit `
`by bit...`
` a splash of blood seeped into view.`
` Then, right there, ......a corpse appeared.`
` But, ...that couldn't be......`
`"Th, `
`......this is......`
`...m, `
`......me...?!"`
`It was Lion, ......lying dead against the wall......`
` Ushiromiya Lion's corpse lay there exposed......`
`"Wh, what's going on here......?`
` Why am I here...?`
` This is supposed to be Clair's world, not mine...!`
` Clair and I can't exist at the same time, right...?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` That's because I just switched worlds...switched Fragments.`
` Switched to your world, that is."`
`"......I don't understand!"`
`"It's very simple.`
` They both end the same way.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why am I supposed to be dead here?!!"`
`"In your world,`
` on October 4th, 1986,`
` Beatrice's funeral was held just before the family conference."`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` And for me, that happened today, a short while ago!"`
`"From that time until late that night, do you know what happened...?"`
`"Nothing at all!!`
` The cousins all played together, and the whole family had dinner together!"`
`"Then, the family conference took place that night.`
` .........You were going to succeed the headship when you turned 20, right?`
` Was the entire family satisfied with that, I wonder...?"`
`".........I don't know if they were satisfied, but the decision had been made.`
` ......The Head made it himself."`
`"Looks like you don't really believe they were satisfied.`
` That's it right there. `
`......Kinzo adored you more than anything...and tried to make an exception and set you up as the next Head.`
` Of course, his children wouldn't have been happy with that."`
`The siblings objected to having Lion succeed the headship.`
` Even Krauss joined in, saying that Lion was still too young.`
` Then, on the night of the family conference, Kinzo tried proposing a difficult riddle......`
`"Could it be.........?"`
`"That's right.`
` The riddle of the epitaph.`
` .........As you can tell by the mechanism set into the chapel, Kinzo thought up the epitaph trick near the beginning, when the mansion on Rokkenjima was being built.`
` ......He had the romantic idea of someday using it as a test to select the next head."`
`Kinzo decided to present that riddle at the family conference.`
` Did he plan to give the position of successor to the person who solved it?`
` Or did he promise to reconsider Lion's position as the head if it was solved? `
`Either way, Kinzo was confident.`
` He was confident that no one would be able to solve this tough riddle, which he had created himself.`
`"After that, everything happened exactly like the truth you just saw.`
` The siblings solved it right away, and there was a quarrel over the pile of gold.`
` *giggle*......`
` Then, Kyrie and Rudolf decided to prevent any chance of the crime being discovered the next morning and an outcry being raised. They carried out the late night murders.`
` .........They called the kids out from the cousins' room one by one, then killed them."`
`"......As the first of the cousins, you were the first to be called out.`
` Then, Kyrie shot you dead right here in the parlor."`
`"......No, that's not quite right.`
` You're the Ushiromiya Lion from the early evening of October 4th, 1986. `
`So, I'll say it this way.`
` ......Tonight, Kyrie will shoot you dead in the parlor."`
`"That's.........insane...... `
`It's... That's right, probability!`
` Just like Lion can be born from Clair thanks to a rare miracle,`
` Kyrie oba-san only commits murder with a tiny probability, close to zero! That must be it!`
` Aren't you the witch who specializes in finding extremely improbable worlds?!!"`
`"That is correct.`
` I had to find one Fragment out of 2,578,917 in order to discover the miracle that is you. `
`......However,`
` it was very, very easy to find this result for your world.`
` After all, probability isn't a factor.`
` ......I'm a witch who can find any miracle, no matter how unlikely it is."`
`"But I can't find things that don't exist.`
` ......If the Witch of Certainty really guarantees that something is certain, even I can't win against her."`
`"But...`
`...then...`
`...I............"`
`"With a 2,578,916 out of 2,578,917 probability,`
` you live in the world as Clair, are toyed with by an inescapable fate, and reach a tragic end.`
` And, with a 1 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live as Ushiromiya Lion...`
` and are killed by Kyrie tonight."`
`"......In other words, your fate...no, the fate the two of you share, ......traps you in an inescapable dead end, a hell of fate, with a 2,578,917 out of 2,578,917 probability.`
` To put it another way, it's a certain fate, with absolutely no chance for a miracle! `
`*giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheh!! `
`Sucks for you, Clair.`
` No, Beatrice."`
`Just when a bright light seemed to turn the world white, the scene suddenly changed back to the theater.`
` On the stage, Bernkastel's reaper scythe slid across Clair's stomach as the latter stood absolutely still.`
` A red line was drawn across the white skin, exposed now that the dress had been cut, and black blood began to seep out......`
`"Beatrice.`
` Trapped in that inescapable, certain, locked-away pair of days, you became a witch who could give birth to endless possibilities within that two-day cat box.`
` ......In exchange, it was absolutely certain that you would not be saved or rewarded. `
`However, you had a dream.`
` ......You dreamed of Ushiromiya Lion.`
` ......You consoled yourself with the thought of a miracle world, where you could have lived in happiness and would never have become Clair!"`
`".........I had to work hard to find Lion.`
` As Beato dreamed, Lion's existence is a true miracle.`
` And, at the end of your funeral, I wanted to show you. `
`......To show you that, even with that miracle, you couldn't have escaped this tragedy!!"`
`Through the small crack between the bars of the jail that imprisoned her,`
` the witch called Beatrice dreamed of a world where she might have been happy...`
` However, the space she could see through that crack in the bars...`
` was just another part of the same jail......`
`"The more I hear......the less I understand about you......! `
`Why...would you do something like this...?!"`
`"I lost a game to Beatrice, so I wanted to get back at her.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Yeah, now I feel a lot better about losing that game...!`
` Hey, Beato, are you watching?`
` Can you see this?!`
` And do you remember?`
` Remember when I promised you that a miracle wouldn't occur, with certainty?!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahah, ahhahahahahaahahahahahahahaha!! `
`So, Lion!`
` Allow me to return you to your world, right before Beato's eyes!! `
`It looks like the theatergoing witches are all sick and tired of those happy family get-together scenes.`
` So, I'll send you to the moment just before Kyrie shoots you!`
` Then, I'll make Beato watch that moment!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahaha!!`
` Die, scum Lion!`
` The last hope of that scum Beato, uhyahhahhyaahhaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`Bernkastel raised her reaper scythe...`
`...swung it down with gusto...`
`.....and plunged it deep into Clair's stomach......`
`"Did you think you'd get an easy death?`
` Hehihihihihihihi!!`
` But humiliating and tearing out a corpse's guts is my specialty...!!"`
`She took the blade end of the scythe, and heartlessly, ruthlessly, brutally......raised it up into the air.`
`......Along a vertical line from Clair's stomach to her chest, `
`......the blade cut deeply...`
`...slicing Clair open.`
` The red-black insides...`
` jutted out...`
` then burst like a dam breaking, covering the world with dark red entrails......`
`"S, steal the Italians' gold, you say?`
` You coward, Ushiromiya! And you call yourself a soldier of the Empire?!!"`
`"......F, Father......?`
` I, I do love and respect you, Father......`
` B, but, ...your feelings are something I, ummm......"`
`"Why...?!!`
` Why did you save me?! `
`Why didn't you let me die?!`
` Because of that terrible injury, ......I've been forced to live in a body like this!!`
` I never wanted to live in a body like this!! `
`This body that isn't even capable of love......!!`
` What's...what's the point in living like that?!`
` This isn't a human's life...!!`
` It's like being furniture!!"`
`"That's right, I'm...furniture...!!`
` Furniture...!! `
`Why......why didn't you let me die back then?!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh......!!!"`
`"............Huh-"`
`When I came to,`
` ......I was in the parlor of the mansion.`
` When did I get here?`
`......I heard a sound behind me, then slowly turned around......`
` And there............`
`"Sorry. Please don't take this personally."`
`"............Huh-"`
`I could see down the frigid barrel of the gun Kyrie oba-san was pointing.`
` Then `
`......she slowly...`
`...pulled the trigger......`
` I could feel a razor-sharp wind pass through my body like a knife slicing through butter.`
`......Prepared for death, and hoping to see my fate until the end, I slowly opened my eyes...`
`......The world had been cut in two.`
` Kyrie was frozen in place like a statue, still pointing her gun with a cold smile on her face...`
`...and had been cut in half at an angle, the top part of her slowly sliding off to the side.`
` No, that wasn't quite right.`
` That wasn't right at all.`
` It wasn't just Kyrie.`
` The whole world had been sliced in half at an angle, and was slowly sliding off to one side.`
` Then, immediately after fissures seemed to appear across the world, it shattered.`
`"............?!`
` ......Y, ......you......!"`
`"......When you own a cat, you tend to pick up their habits."`
`He pointed at Bernkastel with the tip of the pitch-black sword that had sliced the world, glaring at her.`
`"*giggle*giggle*......`
` ...What's this?`
` Are you saying you came back here on a whim...?"`
`"......There was no way you'd end things on a happy note.`
` Do you really hate Beatrice so much?"`
`"You think I'd let her win and get away...?`
` I have to pay her back in full for the humiliation she caused me.`
` When I hold a grudge, a mere century isn't long enough for me to forget it."`
`"You're a gloomy person."`
`"Please, you mustn't forget my heart.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Are you okay, Lion? `
`.........Hey, what's wrong?!"`
`Lion had suddenly doubled over, groaning.`
`".........My chest...`
`......hurts......`
` ......It's..."`
`Will roughly grabbed the hand that was pressed against Lion's chest and tore it away.`
` Blood was seeping out of the place that Lion's hand had been.`
`......It was the place that the bullet would have entered if Kyrie had shot Lion.`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Looks like Lion's body `
`is almost ready to accept its fate."`
`"Lion, hang in there! `
`......Damn these chains...!"`
`When Will tried to pick Lion up, he finally noticed the chains attached to each wrist and ankle.`
`"What's this?`
` Are you trying to take that kid and escape?`
` I won't let you.`
` I'm about to let everyone watch as Lion coughs up blood, despairing at the fact that there is no hope in any of the many worlds...`
` before finally dying in agony."`
`"Lion isn't a show."`
`Will swung his pitch-black sword and destroyed the chains binding Lion.`
` The chains and shackles shattered into little bits like glass...then vanished.`
`"You intend to get in the way of my fun......?"`
`"You aren't God.`
` All you can do is sneer at fate.`
` ......Lion's fate is decided by Lion.`
` You can't use a human's fate like a toy."`
`".........*giggle*giggle*, `
`hahhahahhahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`You've got guts, saying that to the great Bernkastel, witch of the Senate!`
` I have no more use for you either, get it...?"`
`"You've shown that Beato's fantasy is a mystery and cut it to pieces.`
` You've fulfilled your role.`
` I would've let you be, if only you'd just left quietly.`
` Now that you've strolled on back here, you can hardly complain when I make you my plaything."`
`"Come to me, my cute kitties.`
` ......Scratch them up and tear off their skin.`
` Peel them like grapes...!"`
`When Bernkastel clapped her hands twice, countless pairs of glaring jewels appeared all around Will and Lion.`
` They were clearly cat eyes, but the way the drool hung from their mouths looked far more terrifying than any cat...`
`"......Will......`
` ......Aahhnn......"`
`"I'll handle this.`
` Trimming kitty nails is nothing new to me."`
`The number of jewels surrounding them already reached into the thousands.`
` Will pointed his sword in one direction after another, warding off the surrounding cats......`
`"Get a grip, Lion.`
` You haven't been shot.`
` Don't acknowledge that you have been...no, that you will be shot...!"`
`".........Nngggghhh......"`
`Lion tried to fight an incredible tearing pain.`
` No, ......it was a fight against the promised future that Bernkastel had shown.`
` However, the gouging stake representing that future, which the Witch of Miracles had guaranteed would certainly contain no miracle, was firm and merciless......`
` Bit by bit, and yet unceasingly, it continued to pierce Lion's chest......`
`"......Listen up.`
` ......I'm gonna break through their perimeter for just a second.`
` When I do, you need to run with all you've got.`
` It doesn't matter where.`
` Just make sure you get far away from this place, `
`and keep on running no matter what happens."`
`".........I'll try...`
` to the best of my ability......`
` ...If I can't do it, `
`...please forgive me......"`
`"......If you can't do it? `
`Enough whining.`
` I won't forgive you.`
` Neither will Clair. `
`......Did you forget that you're Clair's 1 in 2,578,917 chance?`
` If you give up, you're betraying all the other 'yous' in countless worlds......!!`
` So don't lose heart! Keep on struggling and struggling...!!`
` Don't look for a miracle... Be one!!"`
`"......Be......a miracle......"`
`"You're gonna reach a happy future.`
` You can't give up, and you can't complain.`
` Just you try complaining one more time.`
` This time I'll pinch your ass...!"`
`".........O, ......okay......"`
`"*giggle*giggle*. `
`Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhahha!! `
`How very confident you are, telling this kid to be a miracle when you stand before the Witch of Miracles...!`
` Miracles are no more than fantasy!`
` Grovel in this world that has been convicted as a mystery, and die horribly like a worm!`
` The witches of theatergoing are looking forward to watching it!!"`
`"......Hmph.`
` You call that mystery?`
` You think I'd ever accept a mystery without heart?`
` Let the cat who wants to be made into a shamisen strike first."`
`"Gah, what a pain.`
` Let's have all of you at once!`
` I'm Willard H. Wright, SSVD's Head Inquisitor of Heresy. `
`This'll be the final time I draw my sword...!"`
`"Trash him, kitties."`
`At once, all of the cat eyes opened wide, undulated and spun in a spiral, then swallowed Will up.`
` But Will and Lion were not swallowed up.`
` The cats that had flown in at them from all directions were now being launched away, like a balloon popping around them.`
`"......Oh, not bad."`
`"I don't give a damn about your kitties.`
` It's just the mama cat I care about. `
`.........Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles!!`
` It's about time someone trimmed your claws!!"`
`Another flash of the black blade spun in a black tornado and scattered the cats once more.`
` Lion, realizing that this was the opening Will had planned to make, ran all out, hand on chest.`
`"......Will, ......I'm running."`
`"Diana has a weak stomach.`
` Make sure you only give her warm milk."`
`"Huh?"`
`By the time Lion asked Will to repeat what he had said, he had already leapt onto the stage and was now confronting Bernkastel.`
` It was like the climax of a show.`
` ......Loud cheers erupted from the pitch-black audience seating.`
` On either side of Clair, who lay with her insides exposed,`
` ......stood Will, with his pitch-black sword, and Bernkastel, with the scythe that could harvest miracles from fate.`
`"Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits, and they massacred the people on the island?`
` They called Lion out to the parlor, then shot Lion to death? `
`Sorry, but this 'truth' of yours just doesn't work as a mystery.`
` This is all fantasy."`
`"Fantasy?`
` You're calling it that to try and let Lion escape fate? `
`By all means, try.`
` *cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Ahhhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha, hiiyaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.}"`
`......Surely, Will's black sword must have cut through Bernkastel's body.`
` However, it had no effect, ......like cutting the reflection of the moon on the water.`
`"What's this?`
` What do you mean by 'clues'?"`
`"I won't accept your 'mystery' with Kyrie and Rudolf as the culprits.`
` ......You won't find clues showing that they're the culprits no matter which game you look at."`
`"Of course you won't. `
`Even if they did exist at one point, the whole island blew up."`
`"Which means there aren't any clues. `
`And that means this is no mystery.`
` It's fantasy."`
`"......Huuh...?"`
`It is impossible for an unprovable truth to become truth in the human world.`
` In other words, even the truth cannot leave the cat box.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Are you trying to shut the truth inside the cat box?`
` *giggle*giggle*, is this how the mystery genre is supposed to fight? `
`Ahhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`Hiiyahhhahahahahahaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`With a laugh like the howl of a wild animal, Bernkastel carelessly tossed her scythe aside.`
`"You're not even worth fighting.`
` Get over here, scum.`
` Try and cut me all you like.`
` I'll listen to all you've got to say."`
`"......The twenty wedges'll pierce every part of your heartless mystery.`
` Here it comes."`
`"And when you realize that you can't defeat me with those twenty wedges, ......you know what'll happen next, right?`
` *giggle*, come on.`
` I'll play with you, ......if that's what you want!"`
`"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!"`
`Trying to ignore an incredibly painful chest, ......Lion kept on running and running without stopping.`
` I dashed out of the theater of the theatergoing witches, then ran through an incomprehensible world of blackness.`
` Before I knew it, I was running through a place that looked like a sea of stars,`
` ......or maybe the bottom of the ocean with stars scattered around.`
` If I get careless for a second, I'll probably trip.`
` No, if I get careless, I won't be able to tell if I'm running...`
`...or just making running motions as I free fall, endlessly sinking deeper into the ocean of stars.`
` I just kept on running, without any goal or target.`
` I mustn't stop moving.`
` I mustn't fall down here.`
` If I fall, ......I'll crush the hope of the 'me's in countless worlds...`
` The happy world that the Beatrices dreamed of.`
` I'm their last hope, the only one who can reach that world...`
`......Even though I understand this, ......the 'truth' thrust in front of me by the witch who controls miracles...who says there can be no miracle...`
` is cruelly gouging itself into my chest......`
`"............`
`......Sorry, ......Will......`
` ...My body's...already........."`
`Lion finally...`
`...succumbed to the fierce pain and fate...`
`...and fell over......`
` Lion's body was held roughly from behind and lifted up.`
`"............!! `
`......W, ......Will......!!`
` You're okay......!"`
`"No, not really.`
` ......Didn't I tell you I'd pinch your ass if you gave up?"`
`"......Sorry...`
`...I'm really sorry......`
` ...But, `
`...on that day, in that place, I was fated to be killed......"`
`"That's right.`
` All humans are fated to die in the end.`
` Does that mean their lives are meaningless? `
`Of course not.`
` What a person's life means, what it's worth, what it is...these are things a person decides for themselves.`
` ......No matter what sort of fate is forced upon them.`
` Don't accept it.`
` Create your own world...for yourself...!"`
`".........Will, ......your...left arm...!"`
`"Ah, right... Must have forgotten it.`
` It'd be a pain to go back and get it now."`
`There were rips all over Will's body.`
` Also, his left arm had been brutally torn off from the elbow, his clothes were in tatters, ......and he looked like a bloodstained scarecrow...`
` Then, Lion noticed.`
` Though this place had once felt like a sea filled with stars, both above and below them,`
` ......those stars had now gathered together and were surrounding them...`
` That huge, even number of stars, all glaring at the two of them...`
` Will was holding Lion with one arm.`
` He couldn't take his sword out.`
` However, he didn't let go.`
`......He was determined to let Lion escape from here, and to lead Lion towards the happy tale that the Beatrices had dreamed of.`
` Behind the cats whose eyes glowed out of the empty darkness...the queen of cats who permitted no miracles appeared......`
`".........Willard.`
` Put Lion down.`
` If you do, I'll let you go."`
`"Go file a protest with the Great Court.`
` You can put it up for debate."`
`"......Will, `
`...I......"`
`"I won't leave you behind.`
` ......I need to tell you.`
` To tell you why I quit SSVD."`
`"......Come to think of it, even I don't know that.`
` ......Why'd you do it?"`
`"It's because I got fed up with all those damn sob story mysteries.`
` ......We're gonna survive and make a happy ending."`
`"I'm gonna show her.`
` Beatrice died in despair, thinking that there were only bad endings.`
` I'm gonna show her that a happy ending can exist. So I'll never put you down."`
`"............Will..."`
`"You can take the rest of my left arm, cats.`
` I'll give you my legs too, if you want them. `
`......But I'm not letting go of Lion here.`
` ......I'm gonna let Lion escape your bad ending if I have to crawl out of here......!"`
`"Are you okay with this, Lion?`
` Will's planning to die protecting you.`
` You don't want that, right?`
` Go ahead and tell him to leave you be and save himself."`
`"............Will......"`
`"Yeah."`
`"...Please, ......don't leave me here......!`
` ......I'll definitely survive!`
` And so will you...!!"`
`"Good."`
`As he said this, Will held Lion tight.`
`"There you have it.`
` We'll keep struggling on, Bernkastel."`
`"We won't give up on the chance of a miracle...!"`
`"You're saying that? When the Witch of Miracles has promised with certainty that there will be no miracles? `
`.........*giggle*giggle*, `
`ehhehehehehahahahahahahahaha!! `
`So long, you two.`
` Go collect dust in the depths of oblivion, unable even to die, and disappear!!"`
`"Come, my kitties.`
` I won't tell you to kill them.`
` Just clean up the two pieces whose role has ended."`
`A million, a trillion, ten quadrillion cats all bared their fangs.`
` In the starry sky of cat eyes, countless flesh-colored mouths opened, exposing countless teeth.`
`{a:c:......The world was wrapped in flesh and blood and fangs.}`
