`Rosa could be seen in the parlor.`
` It seemed that the relatives all wanted to be alone now that they had dispersed for a short break.`
` Since everyone avoided the parlor, the one place where people would normally gather,`
` Rosa was able to have this relaxing and comforting room all to herself...`
` That didn't mean she looked relaxed.`
` Her expression was heavy with gloom and weariness.`
` The cup of red tea that she had brought from the dining hall had gone cold......`
`".................."`
`......A pleasant silence.`
` Now that no one was in sight, Rosa's heart finally awoke.`
` She was always treated like a kid in the conferences with her three siblings.`
` She had no influence at all.`
` But, possibly because of that, she was apparently considered to be a neutral party.`
` The siblings would often ask for her agreement, sometimes even treating her like a referee or a judge.`
`"......I have to make use of that...`
`...and turn the discussion in the direction I want."`
`I have to find almost a hundred million yen by March.`
` That was supposed to be my great commitment, a burden I bore to help support 'that man's' business.`
` Now, ......I'm not sure anymore.`
` If I can pay off my debt, ......will he call me again?`
`......Don't kid me.`
` Even if you do contact me after all this time, ......I'll be the one to refuse.`
`......But still, `
`......you are Maria's father, aren't you......? `
`Please come and see her, `
`......if only just once......`
`"......Love is quite a difficult thing...`
`......to stick to, isn't it?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Wh, ......who......?"`
`Though no one should have been in the parlor, someone suddenly spoke to Rosa and she jumped.`
`......Just when had it happened...`
` Kanon could be seen standing there.`
` Even considering that she had been deep in thought......to think that she hadn't noticed him at all......`
`"......You scared me.`
` ...Sorry, I guess I was thinking so hard that I didn't notice you.`
` ......Need something?"`
`"No.`
` ......The reason you are currently in pain is because of love, Rosa-sama.`
` ......Am I wrong?"`
`"Th, that's sudden.`
` ......I'm not sure what you're talking about."`
`"......Maria-sama's father wanted you to be the co-signer on a loan, `
`and you accepted, Rosa-sama."`
`"...............`
`...What a troublesome kid.`
` ......You were listening to Krauss nii-san from the hallway, weren't you...?"`
`......True, earlier this day, in this very room, `
`Krauss had seen through to the fact that Rosa was bearing a massive debt because she had become a co-signer on a loan.`
` However, he hadn't said that her partner had been Maria's father......`
` Why......did Kanon know so much......?`
`"You are a very wise person, Rosa-sama.`
` ......You wouldn't have become a co-signer `
`without thinking carefully about the consequences."`
`".........I hadn't yet moved to his family register, `
`but I thought of the man I would soon marry as my partner.`
` If he couldn't borrow the money without my name, I figured that helping him out was my responsibility as his future wife."`
`"......And did that future ever come?"`
`"............"`
`No, it hadn't.`
` So afterwards......Rosa was always alone.`
` And Maria......never had a father.`
` However, time moved on.`
` Maria, who should have been a symbol of their union, just kept growing,`
` almost like a living hourglass measuring the length of the hell Rosa had crawled through......`
` Because of that, Maria's growth......hurt.`
`"......It's ironic.`
` ......I tried to forget that man several times.`
` ......But you know, forgetting him doesn't get rid of that debt."`
`It was only natural.`
` ......That's why she had to forget her love `
`and do all she could to pay that money back.`
`"But you know, I also think of it this way.`
` ......If I can manage to pay everything off, it'll mean that I've passed the trial of love that he gave me.`
` ......If I have to pay off my debt anyway, how can I abandon my reward, the love I'll gain as a result, before it's over...?`
` Don't you think I could put off thinking about that until after I've paid it all back......?"`
`".................."`
`It may have been a trick of words that only those who have suffered through love could understand.`
` Even Rosa vaguely realized that she might have been deceived.`
` However, if she was able to succeed in paying back the loan, ......he might acknowledge her usefulness as a wife...`
` When that happened, she might be able to regain that love.`
` And if she abandoned that love?`
`......This debt, this 'trial that he had given her', would become completely meaningless......`
` Yes, for her, ......the debt itself appeared to be a trial of love.`
` In fact, the very fact that she looked at it that way might have been her blindness due to love, `
`as well as proof that she still hadn't rid herself of her affection and firm belief in the past...`
` And that pain still continued within her......`
` At the very least, ......until she paid back the massive loan, and let a good deal of time pass after that,`
` until she could finally lay her feelings for him to rest...`
`".........Could this be......that hell Kyrie-sama spoke of?"`
`"......Probably.`
` ......Though I'm not sure what you're talking about.`
` ......There's no doubt that my world has been a total hell."`
`"And how can that be put to an end...?"`
`"......Who knows?`
` If anyone did, ......no one would ever be crushed by the disease of love."`
`That disease is a serious one.`
`......It sometimes eats into a person for their entire life, .....spreading to and hurting the people closest to them.`
` That disease was torturing her now as much as it ever had...`
`"Well, since you bring up Kyrie-san,`
` ......her story is like a wish or a dream to me."`
`Though she had her man stolen from her, she persevered for 18 years.`
` She never fell to despair, and instead continued to support Rudolf, hiding and waiting for a miracle......`
`"Maria is still nine years old.`
` ......I've only waited for the first half of Kyrie's 18 years. `
`......If I gave up after just this, ......she would laugh at me."`
`"......Do you think that a miracle will occur within nine years?"`
`"............`
`......If I doubt that, it's all over."`
`"............"`
`"In a sense, I'm a ghost.`
` ......I am already dead.`
` I'm just living on without noticing."`
`"......A ghost waiting for eternity for a person who will never come......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......That day, when I naively said that I wanted to support his dream, I was probably already dead.`
` .........I guess that really was a regretful day, in the end.`
` 'I have dreams. I want to go overseas.`
` I'll fly out of this tiny country, make it big, and come back to you'.`
` ......That takes me back..."`
`......At that time, I thought of lovers as a pair of people willing to acknowledge the other's radical dreams.`
` That's why he would always talk happily about how I'd become a successful designer`
` and release new items in Paris while being jostled by the press.`
` When I think about it, ......I really had my head in the clouds during that strange time.`
`............We both lifted the other up, as though we were drifting about in the air.`
` So, when he said that he wanted to get out of Japan, I applauded him and promised to support him.`
` Acknowledging each other's great dreams is a standard sort of pillow talk for lovers.`
` However, when it comes to actually carrying them out, ...you need to be more serious and calculating.`
`"......For a long time, I felt proud of letting him go on that day.`
` ......No, I still do."`
`"............`
`......But you still regret it."`
`".........That's right.`
` .........If I had sobbed and told him to stop on that day, I might not have fallen into hell.`
` ......Seeing him off with a smile was my victory?`
` Of course not.`
` It's as though I lost by default by refusing to fight when the time came."`
`"...I only glorified that loss, ......saw him off with a smile as he went to take on the world overseas,`
` and became intoxicated with the illusion that I was some brave woman waiting patiently for her man's return with her daughter.`
` .........Even though, without a single call from him, mail sent to the address he had given me came back 'forwarding address unknown'..."`
`"............"`
`"......This is hell.`
` ......In this hell, I'll regret not fighting when I should have until the day I die.`
` ......I've even dragged my daughter into it. `
`.........I wish someone would just kill me.`
` ......I want to be told that I've already been killed, that I'm a ghost."`
`".........In love, `
`......if you do not fight, `
`......you fall into hell."`
`"......Yes. Love is a fight."`
`"Will you win and gain,`
` or lose and die?"`
`"But please, have no fear of death."`
`"After all, it is a peaceful sleep."`
`""The truly terrifying thing is...`
` the hell into which falls the unsleeping ghosts who cannot win yet cannot die.""`
`"......That hell has no end..."`
`"The battle of love is cruelest to those who do not fight`
` yet cannot die."`
`"......So in love, you've got to give it a shot and put it all on the line. `
`Dying in battle.......is better than the alternative."`
`"They say the most torturous toxin for humans is made from rotting love. `
`......The suffering it brings......exceeds the tortures of the most twisted hells."`
`She used this knowledge to try and embolden her double and little sister, `
`encouraging her to take on any trial no matter how fierce...`
`"............I understand."`
`After all, when my desire to have Battler-san accept me one day wells up in my chest,`
` ......I can feel the seed that resides there.`
`"......It is up to me to kill that seed or make it bud. `
`......However, if I let it rot here in my chest, ......that poison will surely torment me forever..."`
`"And that.........is the most fearsome torture in the world, `
`even for us thousand year old witches..."`
`"See what happens to those who make light of love!`
` This hell of Rosa's-"`
`"Is what happens to those who do not possess the courage to make the seed of love bud, and instead allow it to rot."`
`""One cannot end that pain by their own hands.""`
`.........Huh?`
`......Just now......was that a red light......?`
`".........Pardon me."`
`"......Huh...?`
` ......What.........?"`
`Just now...`
` I thought...`
`...I saw something strange.`
`......I wonder if I'm tired...`
`......It's probably just my imagination.`
` Rosa picked up her cup of cold tea.`
` When she did, `
`......she saw a small...`
`......red rose petal float to the surface.`
`...`
`...`
` A`
`...`
`...`
` rose`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`?`
`".........I have heard that, in your youth,`
` ......you loved to lie on that sofa."`
`"............"`
`It...`
`...wasn't a rose petal.`
` It was...`
`...a drop of blood...`
`......that had fallen from Rosa's eyes.`
` In an instant, `
`......Kanon had beautifully and precisely...`
`......cut just a single thread of Rosa's life...`
` There was no wound on Rosa's body.`
` However, ......several drops of blood...dripped down from her eyes.`
` Her pain, her uncertainties, and her worries......were all gone now.`
` Slowly, ......she fell down onto her side on the sofa.`
` This had been the happiest thing she had done during the happiest time of her life......`
`"Sleep well, ......Rosa-sama.`
` ......Your hell...has ended."`
`Kanon took a blanket out of a cupboard...`
`......and gently covered Rosa with it...`
` To anyone,`
` ......it would have looked just as though Rosa was sleeping peacefully......`
`......Those demons had not exaggerated when calling this trial a battle of love.`
` It was at least accurate on this cruel but unassailable fact:`
` that those who have their love shattered meet with death...`
`"......Now my part is complete.`
` ......Did you see, demons?"`
`"......D, damn......"`
`"How could you kill Mama?!! `
`HOW COULD YOU KILL MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"`
`One of the two great witches of Mariage Sorciere, MARIA.`
` Though she was just an apprentice, the power sleeping within her had impressed even Beatrice at the height of her strength.`
` In MARIA's eyes, though Rosa was the black witch,`
` ......she was also the vessel of the mother she couldn't help but love.`
` Her anger at having that stolen from her was near madness.`
`"How could you...Mama, Mama, Mama!!`
` Nngggyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`MARIA's attack was too emotional.`
` Because of this, she didn't notice that Kanon had vanished for several heartbeats...`
` and she released her barrage at what had become empty space.`
` In the meantime, Kanon jumped from wall to wall, around to MARIA's back...`
`"......Huh...h...?"`
`"......I don't want to kill past my quota. `
`......But I will defend myself...!!"`
`".........Uryuu."`
`"Wh, `
`......what are..`
`......you-"`
`"......Diplomatic immunity! `
`......I won't let you target MARIA or me...!"`
`"D, ......damn......"`
`The red locus blade extending from Kanon's hand vanished in an instant.`
` He managed to make it reappear, but when he tried to use it on Maria and Sakutarou again, it vanished once more.`
` Because of Sakutarou's power, he was unable to make either of them the target of his attacks.`
`"......There you are.`
` ......Since when have you been there......?"`
`"Uryuu... `
`......I won't let anyone bully MARIA."`
`"D, ......dammit......"`
`MARIA finally noticed where Kanon was, and she slowly turned around...`
` Kanon made his sword materialize yet again, `
`but no matter how often he tried, it kept fading out, like a flashlight with a bad battery...`
`"I won't let you get away now......`
`...I won't forgive you...for the sin of stealing my Mama away... `
`......I'll kill you.`
` ...Just like Mama killed the others, ...I'll kill you without mercy!!!"`
`As MARIA howled, the entire parlor was surrounded by a cube of red, magic barriers.`
` It was a closed room symbolizing a barrier that Kanon could never escape.`
`"......D, ...dammiiiiiit...!!`
` Not......here......!"`
`Kanon cursed his bad luck.`
` Even though he had fulfilled his goal in the demons' trial,`
` ......if he was killed here, he'd be dragged off of the game board...!`
`"......MARIA.`
` ......Take it easy."`
`"Yeah, take it easy.`
` ......I'll be a little more gentle than Mama was. `
`......Kuhihihihihihihhi, `
`hahahahahaahahahahaah`
`hahaahahahahahahyahahaaaaaaaaaahh!!!"`
`"......?!?!"`
`"Uryu, who is it?!"`
`"......Pardon me, Maria-sama... `
`In accordance with the contract with Zepar-sama and Furfur-sama, I come for your life...!"`
`"Shannon, ......don't get...`
`...in my waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy!!"`
`"It's pointless, Shannon. `
`......I won't let anyone target MARIA...!"`
`"Yes.`
` I don't intend to target her in any way. `
`......I will simply protect myself."`
`A cylindrical red magical barrier surrounded Shannon as she stood in the center of the parlor.`
` She made its brightness and thickness grow, and its radius suddenly expanded, filling up the room.`
` It wasn't targeting MARIA.`
` This power was being wielded to protect Shannon's body.`
` So, Sakutarou's power didn't make it disappear.`
`".........Hey, ......Nee-san......"`
`"Would you let your feelings for Milady collapse in a situation like this?`
` ......Get ahold of yourself...!"`
`"Ugh, ......ghgh, gghh.........!!"`
`"Uryu...uu.........!!"`
`By now, the shield with Shannon at the center had covered up the entire room.`
` Its power crushed MARIA and Sakutarou into the corner of the room.`
` Ironically, they were perfectly wedged between Shannon's barrier and the closed room barrier MARIA had set up to prevent Kanon from escaping.`
`"...No...good......`
`...Can't......escape......"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*, kuhihihihihihiihihihihhihihiihi!!`
` That's right, this is a closed room... `
`......Kihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` This might be just perfect for that wannabe detective who's trying to deny Beato's magic."`
`".........Checkmate, Maria-sama.`
` ......Is that acceptable?"`
`"Yeah, it's fine!! Crush me! `
`......Kihhihhihhihhihhihhihhii!!"`
`"Then here it comes...!"`
`The entire room was filled with the red light of the shield, ......and the output and pressure were raised to their limits.`
`......Then, crushed between the shield and their own closed room barrier, `
`......MARIA and Sakutarou lost their forms, scattered into a golden splash, and disappeared...`
`"......Thank you.`
` ......I couldn't afford to disappear here."`
`"If you lost in a place like this, you wouldn't be able to give up."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I wouldn't give up if I lost in a place like this."`
`"Zepar-sama, Furfur-sama.`
` We have both finished our trial.`
` Is that satisfactory...?"`
`"Yeah, truly splendid!`
` No complaints for either of you!"`
`"Then shall we finish with Beatrice's turn...?`
` Oh, where did she go?"`
`"To the victim she has chosen, of course."`
`""Then let's go there as well!""`
`......Natsuhi could be seen in her personal room.`
` Krauss had told her to go to bed, `
`but she couldn't afford to lie around sleeping on an important day like this.`
` However, she realized that she was the type to get excited easily,`
` and that this sometimes held her husband back...`
` So, `
`......though she didn't like it one bit, `
`......there was no way around it...`
` It was probably close to the time for the break to end, and the family conference would begin once again in the dining hall.`
` Her husband would have to protect the Ushiromiya family honor from those greedy siblings......all by himself.`
` If she grew emotional by his side, she would just tie him down.`
`...Though she knew that quietly waiting here was the best way she could support him, .....that didn't make the waiting any easier.`
` Natsuhi pulled the small box she kept treasures in out of the drawer.`
` This was her secret box.`
` Inside was everything from valuable items to mere rubbish.`
`......However, they were all precious, memorable treasures in Natsuhi's eyes.`
` She pulled a small pouch out of the box.`
` She stuck her hand inside it.`
`......It was a kind of charm that her own family had given her when she had married.`
`...It was a spirit mirror to ward off evil.`
` Her own face was reflected in the mirror.`
`......She wasn't as young as she once was.`
` Recently, she had seen a bit of her parents and grandparents on her own face.`
` So by staring at her reflection in the mirror like this,`
` she felt as though her soul had returned to the family she had been born into...`
`"......Dad...Mom......`
`......I've always been so neglectful...and unable to support my husband..."`
`Of course, her face in the mirror did not answer...`
` However, Natsuhi continued.`
`"......I am waiting here alone because I love my husband.`
` ......However, I think love means being close to one another.`
` ......Though I understand logically that staying here is the best way I can help him,`
` ......I still feel wretched for doing it...`
` .........It's tough, isn't it...waiting for the sake of love..."`
`With a *plop*, ......a tear fell onto the mirror.`
` Old, dear memories of her life at her parents' house rose up inside her.`
` Now was the time......for her to follow her parents' example...`
` When her father came home late, her mother would always sit up straight waiting for him, prepared for him to arrive at any moment.`
`......She would always wait for him, kneeling in the entrance hall,`
` and no matter how late he came home, she would always wake up all the children and line them up to greet him.`
` At the time, I only thought of her as being exceptionally strict,`
` .........but at this age, I finally understand how strong she was, persevering in her love for her beloved husband even after being left in charge of the house while he was out.`
`"Because of your love for your husband,`
` ......you couldn't bear to be made to care for an unfamiliar child."`
`"......?!?!"`
`The sudden voice made Natsuhi jump up and look about the room.`
` When she did, ......`
` there was a western lady wrapped in an extravagant dress.`
`"Wh, ......who are you?!"`
`"............"`
`Natsuhi was confused.`
` There was no one like this in this mansion.`
` However, though this was her first time seeing her, it felt as though she had seen this person somewhere else...`
` Her mind had gone blank with her anger at the ruffian who had snuck into her private room and confusion over the appearance of someone she didn't know,`
` ......so much so that it took quite a bit of time before she realized that this was the witch of the portrait.`
`"......Though you murdered a baby you didn't know on that day 19 years ago, I will not hold that sin against you."`
`"Wh, `
`.........what are...`
` you`
`...`
` talking about......?"`
`Beato had chosen Natsuhi as her sacrifice.`
` She was 'Battler's' enemy.`
` Beato didn't understand much about the details of Battler's birth.`
`.........However, she knew the Fragment of the previous game,`
` and knew there was a chance that Battler was the baby that Natsuhi had pushed off a cliff 19 years ago.`
` Battler had used his blue wedge to protect Natsuhi from certain false charges,`
` ......but since that might have been related to Battler's own confession,`
` Beato still viewed Natsuhi as an enemy who might have forced Battler to live a painful life.`
`"You killed that baby, who lacked your husband's blood, for the sake of your love for your husband, so, also for the sake of love, I will not hold it against you."`
`"I don't......have a clue what you're talking about!!`
` Get out!! This is my room!!"`
`"Therefore,`
` ......please do not hold it against me when I kill you for the sake of my love."`
`Beato slowly stuck out her arms......and made as if to grab something in empty space.`
`......That grab......bound itself around Natsuhi's neck.`
`"Ggh...`
`......ah...`
`......eh........."`
`Natsuhi's heels lifted up, and a faint, purple shape appeared around her neck...`
` Natsuhi frantically scratched at her neck, trying to stop whatever was strangling her, but there was nothing there.`
`......So, to an outsider, it just looked as though Natsuhi was standing on her toes in anguish, scratching at her own neck.`
`"......Both pairs of lovers have shown their determination. `
`......I do not think...that my love for Battler-san is inferior to theirs...`
` ......Just as I will not blame you for your sin of 19 years ago, ......I will not blame myself for this sin...!"`
`".........Eh`
`.........gah`
`......gghh............"`
`As Natsuhi twisted in agony, something she had been grasping fell from her grip.`
` Since it had fallen by her feet, Beato dropped her gaze to see what it was...`
`......It was......Natsuhi's spirit mirror.`
` When she peered into it, .........there was a sound like a burst of electricity.`
` That sound released Natsuhi from the invisible hands...`
` and made Beato topple backwards like a doll.`
`"*cough*...*cough*cough*......?`
` .........?!??"`
`Coughing, Natsuhi tried to comprehend what was going on around her.`
` Beato rolled over and, dizzy as though she had just bumped her head,`
` she slowly tried to stand up.`
` Her eyes were bewildered, as though even she didn't really understand what had happened.`
`"......Wh, ......what...`
`...what is this......?"`
`"That is...surprising......`
` You could touch spiderwebs without trouble, ......but you can't handle the spirit mirror...?"`
`"E, even I......don't have a clue what's happening...`
` What in the world......"`
`She had thought that only Beato the elder possessed the non-human weak points `
`such as getting burned by spiderwebs and wards and having her power sealed by spirit mirrors.`
` However, ......for some reason, this spirit mirror alone could apparently affect Beato as well.`
` Even Beato couldn't understand what about the spirit mirror had had such an overpowering effect on her.`
`"............!!"`
`But Natsuhi was different.`
` She instantly realized that the reason for the hesitation of this unearthly being, this witch of the portrait......must be the power of the mirror.`
` So, she rapidly crawled across the floor and picked up the mirror.`
` Then, she stuck it out so that Beato could see it...`
`......Beato still didn't know what was happening,`
` so, still sitting down, she looked straight at it.`
` And this time, both of them understood the situation completely.`
` Beato realized that the mirror was working some hateful power against her.`
` And Natsuhi realized that the spirit mirror had the power to repel witches.`
`"......Gghh......uuuuuhhh......!!`
` Wh, ...why is...the mirror......?!"`
`"It is because you are an evil witch.`
` .........This miraculous spirit mirror repels all creatures of evil...!"`
`".........Don't......point it at me......!"`
`With the spirit mirror still held out, Natsuhi cautiously closed the gap between them.`
` She was cautious, so as to prevent the other from suddenly lashing out and stealing the mirror, ......but she steadily moved to corner this evil.`
`"I...I do not know who you are.`
` ......All I know is that you tried to kill me.`
` And I know that you are a creature of evil, fearful of this spirit mirror.`
` ......Begone, evil one...!!"`
`Beato didn't understand what was happening herself.`
`......She didn't know why she had to fear this spirit mirror.`
` However, when she tried to look at the bright light let off by the spirit mirror, it pierced her eyes.`
` Though she didn't understand why she must be afraid, she did understand that she must be afraid.`
` By now, Beato realized that this spirit mirror was both terrifying and harmful.`
` As it came closer to her, she felt an increasingly stronger burning sensation over her whole body, as though someone was approaching her with a hot iron.`
` She couldn't even open her eyes because of the mirror's bright, painful glint...`
`"Uuuuu...`
`...ah...`
`...aaaaaaaahhh......ah..."`
`"Go, return to the world from whence you came, evil one!`
` I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, do not fear evil in the least!"`
`......It's......no use......`
`......Why......? `
`Why is this......musty mirror...so...`
` If...`
`...if I lose here, `
`......I'll be the only one...`
`...to fail this trial......`
` Just like `
`George-san and Shannon-san...`
` Jessica-san and Kanon-san...`
`......I also want Battler-san to acknowledge me...`
`...and treasure me...`
` And...`
`...even though I've finally admitted that...`
`......I alone...`
`......in a place like this......`
`"Are you giving up?!`
` Only you?!"`
`"Believe!`
` The miracle of love will surely occur!"`
`......I...`
` love...`
`...Battler-san...`
` I want him to notice me.`
` And I want him to acknowledge and accept my feelings......`
` If my reason for calling him Father and dedicated myself to him...`
`...was out of duty towards a parent of mine, I would have been satisfied with no reward...`
` That had been...a deception to fool myself with......`
`......I......love Battler-san.`
` And I want him to see me.`
` I accept it.`
` I won't turn away any longer.`
`......I was born because I love Battler-san...and I want him to love me back......`
`"......And so...`
`......I cannot lose...`
`...here......"`
`"Begone, evil one!!`
` There is no place for you here!"`
`"Nn, ......gwaah...!!!"`
`Her determination had come too late.`
` If she had had it since the beginning, ......she would probably have finished Natsuhi off right then without any fear.`
` Because she had wavered, it had taken time to kill Natsuhi, ......and things had ended up like this.`
` But now, I am resolved.`
` I want to love Battler-san.`
` I want him to love me.`
`"......And so...I cannot lose here...!`
` After all, ......I was born for Battler-san's sake...!!"`
`"Yes, that is-"`
`"What we wanted to hear."`
`".........Ah...?!"`
`Just after a sound like a beetle banging off all the walls in the room,`
` the spirit mirror was knocked out of Natsuhi's outstretched hand.`
` It fell onto the floor,`
` ......and the stake flying around the room pierced through it with a crash.`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here! `
`......You dare mock me by having a single old mirror as my first target in so long?"`
`".........Huh?!`
` Ah, ......Lucifer...san......?"`
`"Beatrice-sama, you must complete your trial...!`
` She'll get away...!"`
`"S, ......someone!!`
` Help me!!`
` Someoooooooone!!"`
`Now that the spirit mirror, her last ray of hope, had been smashed, and the number of strange demons had increased, Natsuhi could do nothing but run for it.`
` However, if she made a scene and people gathered, the anti-magic toxin would burn Beato.`
` Now was her last chance.`
`"Th, ......thank you, Lucifer-san...! `
`.........P, prepare yourself, Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!"`
`".........Gggah!!`
` Ghghhgg.......kk......"`
`Once again, Beato choked the thin air.`
` This time, she wouldn't let her escape.`
` She had to end Natsuhi's pain right away before it got too drawn out.`
` ......But...her power wasn't...enough......`
` Though Natsuhi scratched at her neck, she also struggled to escape from the room.`
`......Her shaking hand...stretched out...to the lock on the door.`
` A closed room is one of the definitions that makes a witch.`
` Just unlocking the door made the anti-magic toxin strengthen a little.`
` Since Beato was at her limit even within a closed room, if Natsuhi undid that lock, `
`......Beato's power would weaken immediately, and Natsuhi would surely escape into the hallway.`
` Their strengths were matched.`
` However, Natsuhi's began to surpass Beato's slightly...`
` The power of the living to live is fundamentally stronger than the power of magic.`
` Of course, Beato was mustering all her might.`
` However, ......Natsuhi was just slightly stronger......`
`".........That's enough.`
` ......Lucifer, do it."`
`"A, as you wish!"`
`Lucifer transformed into a stake, and, like the time she had smashed Natsuhi's spirit mirror, flew violently around the room.`
` ......Then, she struck Natsuhi's forehead.`
` Natsuhi......crumpled slowly.`
` When Beato saw this, she also fell to her knees, breathing hard.`
`"Hey, Zepar!`
` Does this count?`
` Beatrice didn't complete the trial by her own strength alone, right?!"`
`"That's right, Furfur!`
` True, this trial must be accomplished without borrowing the help of any other!"`
`"But maybe this is an exception?!"`
`""A pair in love are as one!`
` This doesn't count as help from outside!""`
`".........B, ......Battler-san......"`
`"Did you really have to scare me like that in the first twilight?"`
`"M, ......my apologies...`
` Sorry I didn't listen to your instructions..."`
`"Instructions?"`
`"......Well, ......I didn't stay in my room......"`
`Beato hung her head apologetically.`
`......When he saw this, Battler scratched his head uncomfortably.`
`"In that case, ......I should apologize too.`
` ......I should have been more kind."`
`"N, `
`...no, you did nothing wrong...`
`......Father, `
`...I...I mean...Battler-san..."`
`"It's okay. Call me whatever you like."`
`"Huh.........?"`
`Battler had always looked at the new Beatrice sternly.`
` However, that was gone from his expression now...`
`"......True, the old you may have called me just 'Battler'.`
` ......At first, I might have tried to force you to speak to me that way. `
`......However, that would be pointless.`
` You are Beato...but you're yourself.`
` ......You can call me whatever you want."`
`"B, .........Battler-san......"`
`"Sure, that works great. `
`......Can't say being called Father is really my thing."`
`"...Y, .........yes..."`
`Earlier, she had hesitated just to say Battler's name at all.`
` If Battler had told her to say his name without honorifics, she couldn't have done so right now,`
` .........and even if she had, that might have hurt Battler even more.`
` However, ......now, she was allowed to call Battler by his name.`
` If you just looked into her eyes, `
`......there would be no need to describe just how happy this made her feel...`
`"I heard from Zepar and Furfur.`
` ......It seems a strange game has been started."`
`"Y, yes...`
` Sorry for being so selfish......"`
`"No problem.`
` That reckless way you get into something before you understand it is really like you. `
`......And...well, I've heard about the theme of the game.`
` Apparently, you're supposed to play it in pairs."`
`"Yes, that is correct, sir!!"`
`"If you can succeed in winning through our trial!"`
`""We will bless the pair of you and bestow a miracle of magic upon you!""`
`"It seems these guys have been given the power of Beato's golden butterfly brooch.`
` That means their effect is guaranteed. `
`......We've been stuck with each other for a long time now.`
` Nothing wrong with playing this sort of game every now and then."`
`"......Battler-san............"`
`"Oh, did you hear that, Furfur?!`
` It looks like Lord BATTLER is joining in as well!!"`
`"That's no surprise!`
` After all, we've known since the beginning!"`
`""Welcome to our trial, Lord BATTLER!`
` Then, who will your sacrifice be?!""`
`"......I've already done that.`
` Go and check if you want."`
`"Very well, Lord BATTLER!`
` Come, Furfur, let's go check!"`
`"Yes, let's! `
`But Zepar?`
` This means that all six lovers have succeeded in their trials, right?`
` What should we do next?!"`
`""The resolve of all six is the real deal!`
` Let us test them further in the next trial!""`
`The two noisy demons disappeared.`
` It seemed that they had left to go check on the sacrifice Battler had killed,`
` ......and that they had done so also so that Battler and Beato, who could finally look each other in the eye and talk, could have some time alone......`
`"......What do you think of the tale so far......?"`
`When suddenly asked this question, Ange immediately came to her senses...`
` Then, she realized that she had been immersed in the other's tale.`
` She felt a bit defeated and tried to look displeased.`
`"Y, ......you've cleverly tried to mix things up with all this about the love trial,`
` but exactly six people have died, setting up the first twilight.`
` Impressive."`
`"Oh, you're right.`
` I didn't realize."`
`Amakusa clapped his hands as though he'd been outsmarted.`
` Even though he'd figured it out before me, he played the fool.`
`"......That's simply because the number of lovers just happened to be six. `
`The fact that it matched to the number of the first twilight was half coincidence, half design.`
` ......It's a bit more interesting that way. Feels more like fate."`
`"Humans have the bad habit of taking two meaningless phenomena and trying to link them together.`
` Trying to make things seem like fate is a 'trick' of books."`
`"I guess you aren't a fan of destiny and miracles, Lady."`
`"It's like UFOs.`
` Everyone knows about them, but no one has ever seen them."`
`"There's a cool metaphor."`
`"......So.`
` Normally, I'd try to skip over all the love and illusions and call them unnecessary, useless scenes for the mystery."`
`"......But Okonogi-san disagreed with that way of thinking.`
` He thought that, by looking at things without love that way, the truth could never be reached."`
`"Ah, you mean President Okonogi's killer phrase?`
` Without love, it cannot be seen?"`
`"Yeah, that.`
` ......If I put aside my anger at the person who killed my family in a story, `
`......and even speak with respect for Hachijo, the one who wrote this tale, then there must be a point to this depiction.`
` After all, she's used up all these pages talking about love and trials.`
` ......In other words, those are the themes and key words of this tale."`
`"......Oho.`
` ......And there are many who claim that all words not written in red ink are not worth reading. `
`......It is an honor, child of man,`
` that you have read the black letters as well."`
`"Stories are written because the writer has something they want to communicate.`
` And some writers feel that it's unrefined to lay everything out too directly. `
`.........All of this about how you'll never reach the truth without love has shown up many times in the works before this one.`
` This new work makes that even more striking.`
` ......It means that that is the one thing the writer wanted to tell the most...the thing that they want us to think about the most."`
`......When you think about it, there have been many scenes about love ever since Beato first appeared.`
` Even the first time she appeared before Shannon, she spoke clearly about how love was the single element of the world.`
` And the golden butterfly brooch she had given...was also an item for love.`
` She had said that she enjoyed sowing seeds of love and watching complications arise,`
` and when Shannon stopped borrowing her power, the reason for her argument was also love.`
`......After her interactions with Battler started up in full, scenes about love were toned down for a while,`
` ......but the 'without love, it cannot be seen' definition of magic had been mentioned repeatedly.`
` Then, in the tale right before this one, where Beato had become like a doll,`
` the scenes shown made it seem almost as though Battler and Beato accepted each other as rivals...or possibly something more.`
` In the end, Battler had regained some memory, and his impression of Beato had undergone a complete change.`
`......And then, this game.`
` From the beginning until now, the word 'love' has been repeated over and over again.`
`"The tale you wrote keeps talking about love.`
` However, that's not from Maria onee-chan's viewpoint or Beatrice's viewpoint. `
`......It's Hachijo Tohya's viewpoint."`
`"......Correct.`
` That is what I wanted to tell.`
` And it is my own sort of 'answer'."`
`"Answer?`
` ......Then all of the crimes 12 years ago were a trial of love started by strange demons?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` I didn't come here to read a romance novel you wrote. `
`......What I want to know about is the truth you claim to have reached."`
`"......Foolish child of man.`
` ...After reading all of this, do you still not understand?"`
`With an obviously condescending gaze, Hachijo shrugged.`
` It was clear that she was trying to provoke Ange.`
` She was probably hinting that Ange should just go home if she was annoyed.`
` 'If you're going to read my noble work and not even attempt to see whether you understand it, `
`then get out'.`
`......Normally, Ange would already have thrown a fit and left.`
` However, ......Ange couldn't do that.`
` Though she didn't like someone else toying with her family's fates in a story,`
` ......she was growing increasingly certain of something else as she read through the story.`
`......Just as Hachijo's followers said,`
` ......this tale really does have the same presence......the same scent as the tales written by Beatrice.`
` The author is certainly different.`
` However, because it reached to the real truth, it had the same scent...`
` Ange was beginning to acknowledge this.`
`......Hachijo Tohya......was one who had reached Beatrice's truth,`
` .........an 'Endless Witch' like Beatrice, who could add to the endlessly stretching parallel worlds of the cat box...`
`"......If one has reached Beatrice's truth,`
` ......they can create a new tale, whoever they are. `
`......With this new manuscript, I'm sure some other than myself will appear and reach the truth.`
` ......Those people will be qualified to create new tales of their own."`
`"So there will be more and more Endless Witches..."`
`"Yes.`
` And these many Endless Witches will add to Beatrice's cat box tale.`
` ......The more they add to it, the more people will reach the truth... `
`......When that happens, the very first Endless Witch, Beatrice, will finally be rewarded for writing such long letters, packing them in bottles, and throwing them into the sea..."`
`".................."`
`"......You might have yelled at me angrily and risen from your seat.`
` However, you did not.`
` .........Why?"`
`"I hate to admit it,`
` ......but I'm starting to think that your tale has some kind of truth or hint within it."`
`I already have my own ideas.`
` However, that's no more than looking with a single eye.`
` Unless I accept a different viewpoint from my own and look at things from more than one angle, I'll never be able to see the truth in three dimensions.`
` That's my interpretation of 'without love, it cannot be seen'.`
`"Very well, child of man.`
` ......Perhaps, as the final survivor of the Ushiromiya family, `
`it was fated that you would find the truth and become an Endless Witch. `
`......I exist only as a guidepost to awaken you as the true successor.`
` ......ANGE Beatrice."`
`Sometimes, I don't understand what she's saying......`
` However, she knows something.`
` And maybe......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims...`
`......In other words, I don't know the truth even after the two message bottles Beatrice left behind,`
` ......and I've read several tales with hints afterwards.`
`"So, ......these hints are challenges, provoking me to think."`
`".........Indeed."`
`"Perfect.`
` ......I'll find this truth you say you've reached. `
`......It's a good thing I came here."`
`"That it is.`
` ......I invited you here because you hadn't found it yet, child of man......"`
`Let the truth I see and the truth you see overlap.`
` Just as you see things with a single eye, so do I.`
` Now that I've found you, I can finally look at the truth with both eyes.`
`"Fwaaah......aaaahhh... `
`So, the first twilight has fiiinally happened.`
` Everything so far's made me so sleepy."`
`"......You have some sleep in your eye."`
`"Huh? Wh, where... `
`......Th, that's none of your business."`
`"......Hmph. `
`As you wish, let's begin.`
` ......First off, the first twilight."`
