`"Come on, it's okay now. Let's hurry."`
`"I, I hope Father likes sweet foods......"`
`"Oh yes, he does like them.`
` In fact, he seems to enjoy eating pretty much anything.`
` Hohohoho."`
`After waiting for the master of the study to be out, Beato and Kumasawa entered the study.`
` Then, they quickly cleaned up the books on the desk, set down the basket they had brought there, and opened it up.`
` Inside......were several cute cookies cut out in a butterfly shape.`
` They set out a cute plate and neatly decorated it with the cookies.`
` It was the kind of slight adornment that the person eating wasn't likely to even notice.`
` The whole setup was filled with that sort of feeling.`
`"You spare no efforts for the sake of your beloved Father."`
`"This is......all I am able to do right now."`
`"To think that I would give Battler cookies...`
` Why should I, the ruler of the night, do so much for a guest who comes so rarely?"`
`Then, the study door swung violently open.`
` It was Battler, with Genji by his side...`
` Battler's eyes went wide for a second when he saw Beato there, but his expression quickly went blank again.`
`"......What are you doing here?"`
`"Father, ......please excuse me.`
` I didn't come here to get in the way of your important game......"`
`"How were you able to get in here...?`
` Wasn't this room locked?"`
`"......My apologies.`
` I lent them a key because they wanted to surprise you with a gift."`
`"See, have a look...! `
`Beatrice-sama baked these cookies with all her soul, hoping that you would enjoy them."`
`"Kumasawa-san and Genji-san taught me...`
` I never knew Genji-san was so good at baking cookies."`
`"Hohoho.`
` He hasn't done it much of late, but Genji-san used to cook many things long ago.`
` He was especially good with sweets...!"`
`"Cookies...?"`
`"Y, yes.`
` It's a gift for you, Father.`
` I sincerely pray for your victory in this important match..."`
`Battler looked at the plate on the study desk that was piled up with beautiful cookies...and the message card of encouragement lying next to it,`
` and his face twisted with a complex expression, which might have had traces of both sadness and anger contained within it...`
`".........Master..."`
`Genji urged him to consider saying some words of gratitude to Beato...`
` Battler understood.`
`......He had no reason to respond to this kindness with displeasure.`
` Even though he understood it logically,`
` ......he couldn't help but give a small exasperated sigh.`
`"......Thank you, I'm very grateful. `
`......However, I don't like sweets.`
` Please take it away."`
`"M, ......Master..."`
`"............"`
`"Don't make me say the same thing again.`
` ......Please clean it up and take it away."`
`"M, Master, couldn't you just try one bite...?`
` Beatrice-sama worked hard to make them for your sake..."`
`"......I am grateful for her feelings.`
` ......I'm in the middle of a vital game right now. `
`This is the final game...`
` and it's vital both for me...`
`......and Beato as well. `
`So please.`
` Try not to trouble me any more than is necessary."`
`"That's just too sad for her...!`
` I'm glad that you are grateful for her feelings,`
` but can't you show it by taking just one little bite...?!"`
`"............Father..."`
`Beato looked at Battler sadly.`
`......Battler hung his head to avoid her gaze.`
` The expression on his face caused Beato more pain than any he had shown her before...`
`"............`
`......Kumasawa, please clean this up and take it away."`
`"Master...!!"`
`"............"`
`Kumasawa clung to Battler, but he turned his back to her...`
`"......My...apologies... `
`......Let's clean this up, Kumasawa-san..."`
`"I won't allow it.`
` By making this gift, Beatrice-sama gave it her all to try and support you in the only way she could.`
` To tell her to take it away without eating a bite yourself...how can you trifle with a woman so?!!"`
`".........Kumasawa."`
`"If you call yourself a man, `
`you should at least try a bite when a woman makes you a handmade snack!! `
`If you truly intend to crush a woman's feelings like this,`
` I, Kumasawa, will not back down even if it kills me! No I won't!!"`
`"K, `
`......Kumasawa-san, `
`......you've done enough for me already......"`
`"I won't allow it!!`
` Master, do you think there might be poison inside them?!"`
`".................."`
`......Yeah.`
` If Beato ever came to give me cookies......`
`......Of course I'd think that she'd put some kind of crazy poison in them......`
` She asked me if I thought there'd be poison in these? `
`Do you really think...`
`...that cookies piled up in such a neat and cute way...`
`...could possibly have something bizarre hidden inside...? `
`And...`
`...who could possibly imagine...`
`...that Beato`
` would ever make something like that...she said......`
` Because of that, ......Battler couldn't bear to look at Beato's innocent reaction, `
`which was completely free from any malicious thoughts of slipping poison into the cookies......`
` Beato quietly started to clean up.`
` ......Every now and then, she sniffled.`
` Kumasawa continued to glare at Battler,`
` but she then gave a small sigh and helped Beato clean up.`
` However, the hardness didn't disappear from her expression.`
`".........My apologies, Father.`
` ...Please excuse me."`
`"Don't call me that......"`
`"............"`
`"Don't call me Father.`
` ......Beato never called me that."`
`"Y, ......yes, as you wish...`
`......My apologies."`
`Hanging her head so low that her chin touched her chest, Beato hurried out of the study.`
` After giving Battler a look, Kumasawa chased after her.`
` Kumasawa threw the door open a bit violently, and the footsteps of the pair rapidly disappeared off into the distance...`
`"............`
`......I may be his little sister, but I'm not sure how I feel about that."`
`"If she were anyone other than Beato, you'd think of him as a true enemy of women, is that it...?"`
`"......I don't have a clue why Onii-chan and Beato act so friendly together.`
` Right now, I think of Beato as our greatest enemy, the one we must defeat. `
`......Still, even so...`
` As a woman, ......I can't say I like Onii-chan's reaction."`
`"Though I can understand Battler's feelings a little.`
` ......What a sad state of affairs."`
`I still don't understand what kind of antagonism or connection there was between them.`
` However, Onii-chan probably views Beato......as a friendly rival, if not something more.`
` Onii-chan's reason for defeating Beato isn't to destroy an enemy out of hatred.`
` ......It feels like he wants to give a sincere answer to her questions.`
` Yes.`
` I can't deny the fact that their fight isn't based on hatred`
`...but on a stronger emotion.`
`".........And on top of that...`
`...Beato really is something to remain dedicated to Onii-chan all the more even after being treated so coldly.`
` I agree with the other, older sister Beatrice.`
` ......I can't understand why she's so dedicated to Onii-chan."`
`"And, though it may take a thousand years, `
`that single factor that you don't understand must be passed on to the Golden Witch Beatrice we know so well..."`
`"......Yes.`
` I understand that.`
` ......Knowing this Beato is connected to knowing that Beato. `
`......And that may be able to explain the greatest piece in this crazy game, if not the game board itself..."`
`"Such a mysterious witch......"`
`Though she said those words, Featherine wore a confident smile on her face.`
` Her sarcastic confidence, as though she already knew the answer, was unchanged.`
`".........Beatrice.`
` I want to ask you something."`
`"Y, ......yes, what would you like to know, Ange-san...?"`
`When Ange asked her question, Beato, who had been reading a Fragment book in the shadows of the study, jumped.`
`"......Why do you call Ushiromiya Battler 'Father'?"`
`"B, because he created the piece that I am..."`
`"......In that case, why are you so dedicated to Ushiromiya Battler?`
` Is there some rule that pieces must obey the Creator that makes them?"`
`"There is no such rule.`
` ......Pieces are tools, ...like a knife.`
` ......If the Game Master uses them well, they can be quite useful. `
`However, if you use them incorrectly, they can hurt you as well.`
` ......Whether the tool is used as a tool or a weapon, that has nothing to do with the tool's own will.`
` It is merely the result."`
`"In that case, why are you so dedicated towards Onii-chan?`
` It's almost as though......that's your goal as a piece."`
`"Y, .........yes.`
` ...That is the goal that gave birth to me."`
`"Did Onii-chan, the one who gave birth to you, give you that goal?"`
`"That's not it.`
` ......As the Game Master, Battler merely set 'a piece with that role' on the board. `
`......Also, the one who gave birth to this piece...`
` was the first Game Master and the one who created this game, Beatrice herself..."`
`"......Aaah, this is getting confusing.`
` ......In other words, you keep calling Onii-chan 'Father', but he's not actually your father. `
`......You're just calling him that affectionately `
`because you feel that you must dedicate yourself to him."`
`"Y, ......yes.`
` ......I think that's true. `
`Father was the one who placed me on the game board.`
` If he hadn't, my piece would never have had a turn.`
` So, the reason I exist here right now and the reason I am able to devote myself to my goal...is all thanks to Father."`
`"......I see.`
` So that's why it makes sense for you to call him Father. `
`......In that case, who told you to devote yourself to Onii-chan?`
` ......Gah, that must have been the first Game Master, Beato herself.`
` ......Aaaahh, this is so confusing."`
`"You wish to ask her why she must serve Ushiromiya Battler, correct? `
`However, she cannot give you that answer.`
` She was given nothing but the goal itself.`
` ......Only the person who gave her that goal knows the reasons for which they did so."`
`"......I see.`
` 'Consider that as well, child of man', right?`
` ......So, that means you already have an idea and you're laughing at my confusion."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You really are just perfect for my miko..."`
`"......I will......do anything for Father.`
` ...My existence will bring Father happiness.`
` ......That is my one and only pleasure. `
`......And........."`
`At that point, Beato hesitated.`
`"What?`
` And what?"`
`"Y, yes... `
`......And, `
`.........if I could one day have Father acknowledge my efforts, `
`......it would be my one and only joy..."`
`"Pft........."`
`".........What the hell.`
` ......If you only wanted to serve him, I'd say you're just another furniture of the witch, `
`......but you want him to acknowledge your efforts?`
` That's less like furniture and more like..."`
`Ange stopped mid-sentence.`
`......That's less like furniture and more like...`
`......you're just a girl...`
`......who loves Onii-chan.`
`............I don't...get it.`
` The guiding force behind this Beato's actions...is that of a girl who adores Onii-chan.`
` But then, what does that make this Beato? `
`If the first Beato liked Onii-chan, then she should have adored him and done things for him herself.`
` Why would she create 'a piece of herself', a separate entity, to do it......? `
`This way, ......even if she does attract Onii-chan's attention, it will be towards the piece version of herself,`
` not the creator who made that piece.`
` If I ever like someone, I'll probably want to do things for them.`
` But of course, I would want to do those things myself.`
` After all, I would want him to notice 'me'.`
` It's as though this love is destined to go unrewarded......No matter how devoted she is, she will never get anything out of it.`
` And she's doing this out of her own free will...`
` Beato's actions look no different from those of an average girl in love.`
` She's devotedly doing all she can for him, dreaming that her kindness will eventually be acknowledged.`
`......Why would Beato create a piece like this...? `
`Is putting it in terms of romance a bit too confusing? `
`Then let's try using food as an example.`
` It's as pointless as creating 'a piece to eat food for you'.`
` No matter how much food your piece eats on your behalf, you won't get any less hungry, right? `
`You are the one that wants to eat.`
` There's no reason for having a piece do that in your place.`
` For most jobs in the world, you can get someone else to do it for you.`
` However, with love and food alone, there can never be any meaning in letting another person do it in your place.`
` That's right.`
` ......This Beato was created as a 'piece'...because of an impossible reason......`
`......Though at a glance, she looks like just a normal girl,`
` .........the more I know about her, the less I understand, ......like an imaginary number......`
`"......Father hates it when I call him Father.`
` ......And the 'me' that Father desires...didn't call him by that name either."`
`"Right.`
` The former you spoke to everyone without even using honorifics."`
`".........`
` However, ......simply possessing that knowledge doesn't mean I can refer to Father quite that informally. `
`......I'd like to do my best......and start by calling him Battler-san."`
`"I'm surprised you haven't gotten discouraged after being treated so coldly."`
`"......Fath- `
`......no, `
`......Battler-san is in the middle of an important game right now. `
`His opponent is the formidable Lady Erika, piece of the great Lady Bernkastel.`
` ......It's no surprise that he was in a bad mood when I stepped in at a delicate moment in his game, `
`just as it was starting to reach the critical part,`
` ...and called Battler-san by that name he doesn't want to hear..."`
`"............"`
`Apparently, Beato still wanted to devote herself to Battler, even after being treated in such a cold manner.`
` Though to an outsider, it just looks as though she's being snubbed, ......it doesn't faze her at all.`
` It truly is the blindness of a girl in love......`
`"......Or is it that I can't see because I have no love?"`
`"At times, love can make the invisible visible."`
`Beato once again immersed herself in the Fragment book that the former Beato had written.`
`......She was trying to find something about the Beato that Battler desired.`
` Ange shrugged, as though saying 'well, I don't get it'.`
` Featherine laughed when she saw this, as though hinting that an 'innocent young woman' could never understand.`
` Ange grumbled something back unhappily.`
` It seemed that their give and take had no effect whatsoever on Beato as she sat in the shadows of the library......`
` After chasing all the others out, ......only Battler remained in the study.`
` There was no color in this dimly lit room.`
` However, ......for just the short time that the plate of cookies had been placed there,`
` the room had seemed at least a little cheery...`
` Battler's gaze drifted over to the table, ......which no longer had anything on it.`
` When he did, the cookie plate that had been there until a second ago was revived.`
` However, ......it was an illusion.`
` Though the cookies could be looked at, they could not be touched, much less eaten...`
` If Battler wished, he could make it possible to 'touch them' or 'eat them', ......but it would be an empty sensation.`
` It would only give the touch and taste that Battler desired.`
`......He no longer had any way of knowing `
`what kind of cookies they had been.`
`".................."`
`On the reception sofa across from Battler, `
`......a cloud of gold butterflies slowly gathered, `
`...and took the form of the old Beato.`
`"'Come o~n, have a bite☆ It's not every day that I'll make these by hand...!`
` Have no fear, I'm confident in how well they've turned out.'"`
`"'Pu ku ku ku!`
` Hearing that from Milady makes them all the more dubious.'"`
`"......Seriously.`
` ......Any cookies you made would obviously have some kind of strange poison in them."`
`"'Shocking that you should think so.`
` Even if I did put something in, it'd be no worse than the kind that does this and that to your other thing.`
` Uhyahyahya!'"`
`"'Since you do that sort of thing all the time, Battler-kun will never agree to eat them.'"`
`"'Huh? Putting things in someone's food is pretty basic, isn't it?`
` Fingernails, bits of hair, magic charms, Fragments of love...eheheheheheheheh!`
` What would you people put in?'"`
`"'Yes, ma'aaam!!`
` I wouldn't put anything in them! I'd just eat them all myself!'"`
`"'Obviously. Do you have to be so predictable?!!'"`
`"'Well, they say a girl's gotta grab by all three sacks☆ The first step is the stomach, right? `
`Next comes the wallet...so what could the third one be?! *giggle*☆'"`
`"'If I could catch a guy's attention, I'd want to make him sacrifice his body, heart, and soul to me! `
`That's why I pour all my power and affection into my cooking.'"`
`"'Heheh, in any event, making someone eat your food is probably a frontal attack that has gone unchanged through the ages.'"`
`"'Ridiculous. `
`How pathetic to think that you couldn't grasp a single man's heart except by relying on such simple tricks.'"`
`"Ooh~?`
` So does that mean you've ever succeeded in grasping a man's heart, Onee-sama?'"`
`"'Battler, there's nothing weird in it, so have a bi~te.`
` Don't think you'll ever get a chance to eat my handmade cookies again☆'"`
`.........There probably won't...be another chance.`
` I slowly stretched out my hand, `
`......out to the illusion of the cookie plate, `
`......and touched it.`
` Just before I did, it became a cloud of gold butterflies, ......and vanished into the darkness of the study.`
` The illusions of Ronove and Virgilia also disappeared.`
`...However, the illusion of Beato alone still remained on the sofa.`
`"......Is there something that does not satisfy you?"`
`"............Do I really need to say it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*. `
`......The more the new 'me' differs from the form you wished for, `
`......the more you are reminded that I can never be revived again, `
`......correct?"`
`".................."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you let a good woman get away, you never get a second chance.`
` So, only now, you've finally realized what a good woman I wa~s."`
`"......Shut up. `
`If you never appear again, `
`......that'd be a relief."`
`"Hmph........."`
`Beato lay sprawled on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.`
` Battler also turned his back and moved to the window. ......For a while, there was silence.`
`"I think you understand, but......"`
`"......I do understand."`
`"The 'me' you were expecting...has already disappeared."`
`"......I know.`
` ......Even though that Beato is you without a doubt, ......she's a different being than the former you...`
`......and I can say with certainty......that you will never revive again..."`
`"My soul, femininity, sparkling personality, and splendid character were cultivated in a thousand years spent as a witch.`
` Unless an exactly identical thousand years is traversed, it is impossible to become me.`
` And so, ......at the moment you decided to create me, my personal history contained differences."`
`"Yeah.`
` ............That damn Bernkastel has already guaranteed that you'll never revive..."`
`"However, you still hope for it, don't you?"`
`".................."`
`"One day, the new 'me' trips and lands on her head, and all her memories of the past are restored!`
` ......You were hoping for something like that, weren't you? `
`Ahyahyahyahya!`
` A delusional plot like that wouldn't even pass in a light novel these days!"`
`"......Shut up.`
` ......In the past, you also... `
`......You waited and waited...`
`...for me to remember...`
`...and take notice..."`
`"............"`
`"............"`
`Then, ......what is it? `
`Does this mean...`
`......that our relationship...`
`...is exactly the opposite of how it once was......?`
`".........Hmph...`
` ......Well, at times, I did continue the game believing that you would eventually notice and remember, `
`that a miracle would occur."`
`"............How did it feel?`
` ......How did it feel when you were playing with me?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` As they say, look inside your own heart..."`
`"............"`
`......It's tough.`
` If only she didn't look so much like you, ......I would have kept my cool a little better.`
`"Well, do as you wish.`
` In the past, I toyed with you and tormented you. `
`......Now's your chance for revenge against me.`
` ......The new 'me' will just wander about, ignorant of everything.`
` You may boil or burn her as you see fit.`
` Perhaps it will clear away an old hatred."`
`".........I would if it was you.`
` It'd probably make me feel a lot better. `
`......But...`
`.........that Beato...`
`...isn't you."`
`"If it isn't me, who is it?"`
`"......It's someone very like you, `
`.........but not you."`
`"However, there can be no doubt that she is me."`
`".........True. `
`She is you, `
`......and at the same time, `
`...she is a different person."`
`"In that case, the new 'me' really has it rough.`
` She's being treated like a plaything in my place. `
`......*cackle*cackle*, how truly pitiable."`
`".................."`
`That might...be the contradiction inside me.`
` Because the new Beato seems like a different person, I can't accept her.`
` Even though I know she's a different person, ......she keeps reminding me of Beato's face.`
`"In that case,`
` ......why not think of her as my daughter?"`
`"......Your daughter......?"`
`"She does share my blood, so consider her a daughter that closely resembles me. `
`After all, she is my double, but hasn't lived a thousand years, so calling her that is not incongruous."`
`"......True..."`
`"Imagine that I have died, left behind a daughter.....and entrusted her to you. `
`That way, won't it become a little easier to think of how to deal with her?"`
`"That's actually a good analogy. ......It's unlike you."`
`"Do not jest.`
` That is my daughter.`
` She is the child I left behind after my death. `
`......You are free to press my likeness upon her.`
` You may also let loose your pent up resentment on her in my place.`
` ......Making her bear my sins and torturing her as you please may calm your grudge.`
` If that doesn't match your tastes, you can also guide her down the right path so that she does not end up on the inhumane road that I have tread."`
`"......She was made to devote herself to you since the moment of her birth.`
` If you wish, you can mold her into any shape you desire.`
` .........With a miracle of a thousand years, she might even become me."`
`"......So, I could even strip her naked and drag her around with a chain, like you did to me once."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Yes, at this point, even greater humiliation would be possible..."`
`".....................So, ...she is......your double...`
`...and `
`your daughter..."`
` `
`Yes, she is exactly the same person, the same piece, which was created once more by the rule called Beatrice.`
` However, when I can't accept it that way, .........I could have interpreted her as being Beato's daughter,`
` ......and found a clear guidepost on how to interact with her and smooth the uncertainty in my heart.`
`.........Finally...`
`...I...`
`...I understand how cruel...`
`...I was to her then......`
` My tears poured to the ground, ......and when I followed them with my eyes...`
` I noticed that a white business card had fallen onto the floor.`
` It was......`
` the message card that had adorned those cookies.`
` I rushed her, telling her to clean up and leave right away, which was probably why it had fallen to the floor unnoticed.`
` I picked it up, `
`.........and read the message on it.`
`.........It was...`
` extremely short, ...`
` pure, ...`
` and sincere.`
` It's so clear, ......that I should be able to read it.`
`......However, `
`......it's blurred with tears, `
`...and I can't...`
`......see anything.........`
`......The flood of light and sound slowly dissipated.`
` The silence that followed was not interrupted even by the sound of wind and rain outside that had once been present.`
` Both Jessica...`
`...and George...`
`...timidly opened their eyes...`
`......Where in the world...`
`...is this......? `
`It was a strange room that they had never seen before.`
` It looked like a western smoking room.`
`......Its furnishings were stylish and expensive.`
` It felt as though a dignified person must own this room.`
` Preparations for black tea were set on the table, ......and so was a chessboard, which seemed to be halfway through a game.`
` However, there was something strangely out of place.`
` The black and white checkerboard pattern made it feel like chess,`
` ......but it looked like a very similar yet totally different game that no one knew of.`
` In the same way that it both looked like chess and not like chess...`
` The furnishings of this room...no, the room itself... ...Though it first seemed like a western smoking room,`
` ......it also felt like something completely different...`
`".........J, `
`...just where...`
` is this place...?"`
`"......Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun...`
` ......And Shannon?`
` Where's Shannon...?!"`
`"I'm right here, George-sama."`
`"And I am here. `
`......Milady, George-sama. `
`We apologize for bringing you to a place like this."`
`"......What on Earth is going on? `
`......Just when Shannon took out something that looked like a butterfly wing and it started shining..."`
`"Th, the same thing happened to me...!`
` Kanon-kun took out this golden butterfly brooch thing, it started to sparkle, and..."`
`"Milady, George-san, first off, please allow us to apologize.`
` And please stay calm. `
`......Something strange is about to happen.`
` That strange thing will probably test us."`
`"Test us......?`
` ...Do you mean...`
` that trial you were just talking about...`
`...that we had to overcome if we wanted to be together? `
`......Is that it?"`
`"A......a trial?"`
`".........I haven't explained it to you yet, Milady.`
` My apologies. `
`.........But please, `
`...if your words just a second ago were the truth, ......please lend me your strength.`
` I will give it everything I've got, so please......"`
`"......I...I don't understand a thing that's been happening...`
` Do you know something, George nii-san?"`
`"A bit.`
` .........I'm just as surprised as you about what's happening now. `
`But if they say that this is an unavoidable trial and that we are essential for it, I intend to take on whatever may come."`
`"............A trial......?"`
`"Kanon-kun.`
` The brooch."`
`"Yeah......"`
`The two of them brought the halves of the broken golden butterfly brooch closer to each other.`
` As they grew closer, the strength of their bright yellow radiance increased.`
`"......Jessica-chan, I want you to prepare your heart as well.`
` I am already prepared."`
`"Wh, what do you mean...?!`
` I don't have a clue!`
` What the hell's going on...?!"`
`"It's a trial.`
` A test for a pair of lovers."`
`"H, ......huuh...?!"`
`George spoke these awkward-seeming words quickly and easily.`
` It was such an embarrassing line that Jessica couldn't help turning red,`
` ......but the expression on George's face, which was so serious that it was almost grim, forced her to tense up as well...`
` Shannon and Kanon were just as serious.`
`......With a glow in their eyes, as though they were taking part in a sacred duel, the pair of them brought the two gold butterfly wings together.`
` Then, the wings they held became a single brooch...and regained their magical power.`
` An even more intense light filled the room...`
`...and the scene was burnt into the retinas of all present...`
`...as the brooch shattered and two shining things flew out of it...`
`"People live for the sake of love!`
` Yes, this world is love itself!"`
`"Oh, how great is the power of love...!`
` Love is everything!!"`
`Suddenly, the voices of two people they had never heard before rang out.`
` What was it?`
` Who were they...? `
`George and Jessica nervously opened their eyes......`
` When they did, they saw that two demons had appeared there, `
`......almost as though the brooch which had once been split in two had become them...`
`"Ooh, that's weird, Furfur...!!`
` Why are we in a place like this?!"`
`"It really is strange, Zepar...!!`
` There's no one but humans and furniture! `
`Where is the witch?`
` Where is the witch capable of summoning us?!"`
`"Yes, we remember the name of the witch of the contract really well, don't we? `
`Let's try calling it out, Furfur!"`
`"Yes, you're right, Zepar!!`
` We know the name of the witch of the contract, the Golden Witch!"`
`"Then let's try calling her!"`
` `
`""Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!""`
`Considering their exaggerated manner, like a theater play, and their slightly humorous style of talking,`
` it would probably be hard, at this moment, to comprehend the great power these demons possessed.`
` When the two demons called Beatrice's name, a cyclone of gold butterflies picked up throughout the room.`
` Then, it took the form of two Golden Witches...`
`"Ooh, there are two Beatrices...!"`
`"Well, there are two of us as well.`
` Why shouldn't there be two Beatrices every now and then?"`
`"This is my double and my little sister.`
` We two are the same and as a single person."`
`"P, ......pleased to meet you."`
`"It has been a long time, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"............"`
`"A, ......am I dreaming......?"`
`"......I feel the same. `
`Still, it's too early to get dumbfounded."`
`Unlike Jessica, George had maintained his composure even during this bizarre scene.`
`......After all, Shannon had already told him what would happen next.`
`"Demons of the contract, it has been too long...!`
` Zepar. `
`And you too, Furfur."`
`"Ah, long time no see!`
` You seem to be in high spirits as always!"`
`"But look at your cute little sister here!`
` Those juicy eyes must have the taste of white peaches when they grow teary...!"`
`"Uh, ...ah, ...well, I wonder..."`
`Zepar and Furfur latched onto Beato from either side, wearing strange smiles.`
` Each movement they made was exaggerated yet polished,`
` as though they were acting out a play.`
`"Leave it at that for now, demons of the contract. `
`To think that tonight will be the last time we see that mischievous spirit.`
` It will be dearly missed."`
`"The last time......?"`
`"The brooch, our vessel, has already been destroyed!"`
`"Eheheheheh, in other words, our role is finished after this!`
` Ah, yes, it has been fun, Beatrice!"`
`"However, it was decided when the contract was made.`
` It was decided that we must lend our power one more time before our final farewell."`
`"So, this is truly the final miracle!"`
`"Once is enough for the miracle of love!`
` After all, eternal love will never be needed a second time!"`
`"......There you have it.`
` Lovers! `
`Those gathered here are ones cursed to have unsuccessful love unless a miracle occurs.`
` The power of the golden butterfly brooch, which can grant this miracle, is your last chance, and like it or not, this chance is limited to this evening!`
` This miracle can be given only to a single pair!"`
`".................."`
`"......I won't lose."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Let's both give it our all."`
`Shannon and Kanon exchanged a serious gaze.`
`......Both had already readied themselves to fight for the sake of their love's success.`
`"I, I don't really get it,`
` ...but I don't wanna borrow the power of some strange demon...!"`
`Jessica was finally starting to figure this place out.`
` These demons......were probably planning to pit her and Kanon against George and Shannon.`
`"Let me be clear: this is none of your business!`
` Kanon and I can handle our relationship by ourselves.`
` I'm not obligated to put myself in the debt of some bizarre demons!"`
`".........Milady, please listen. `
`...If we don't overcome this trial, `
`.....we cannot be together..."`
`"Jessica. Accept it. `
`This is the only trial that can be imposed on upstart furniture wishing to be joined with a human."`
`"More of this stuff about furniture and humans!`
` Don't butt in...`
` This has nothing to do with us!!"`
`"You still haven't told Milady...?"`
`"......I didn't know...how I should explain it."`
`"Kanon-kun, Shannon, and you, George nii-san!`
` Why are you listening to these creeps?!`
` No one can stand in the way of a person's love! `
`Why do we have to please these demons?!`
` It's none of their business!!"`
`"Well, it seems we have quite a troublesome blockhead among us. `
`.........We could begin the game like this, but that would hardly be fair."`
`"C, ......couldn't you explain it for her?`
` ...I don't understand that well myself.`
` Is there some kind of problem with the love between Jessica-san and Kanon-san...?"`
`"Oh my!`
` It seems you understand nothing at all!"`
`"With our blessing, the pair can cultivate their love at their leisure!`
` No need to worry about suspicious demons!"`
`"However, without our blessing,`
` your love will vanish, disappear, wither and decay."`
`"How the hell're you so sure?!!"`
`""Because it is fate!! `
`You may choose not to accept it, you may choose not to resist it!""`
`".........Oh, what happens if you choose not to resist it...?"`
`"That love will end.`
` ......Well, an abstract explanation isn't so convincing. `
`Well now, how could one explain the dead end fate you're in..."`
`"Ushiromiya Jessica, the future you two share is far more grim than you realize."`
`"If you don't gain the miracle of magic, disaster will most certainly befall you."`
`"Then it will cover you, fester within,`
` and split the two of you apart. `
`......Even I will not be so boorish as to describe the details of that process.`
` However, if you will not believe, Jessica, I will tell you how it ends.`
` ......Kanon will stop being a servant and will leave the island.`
` For all eternity."`
`"You will probably leave the island yourself in search of the one you love, but such a venture will doubtless be in vain!"`
`"Yes, and then you will mourn and hate!"`
`"Hate who?!"`
`"You!!"`
`"Me?!"`
`""No, the 'you' of this moment!!""`
`With a dramatic gesture, the two of them pointed at Jessica.`
`......They were saying that, if she left, the person left with regrets would be Jessica herself.`
`"Wh, `
`......what the hell are you...`
`...saying......"`
`"When you have lost the one you love, you will realize.`
` You will realize how much you hate the person you were when you ran away from the trial to complete that love!"`
`"Yes, we're messengers from the 'you' of the future!`
` Please, at this very moment, take your love seriously and fight!"`
`"And if you don't listen to the message of the 'you' from the future?!"`
`"The foolish snake eating its own tail will keep on gulping!"`
`"The endless cycle of suffering will swallow you up......and you will simply vanish."`
`"What the...hell are you talking about...?!!"`
`Jessica's confusion showed up on her face as anger.`
`......However, a memory of what she had heard a long time ago welled up in the back of her mind.`
`......Unlike Nee-san, I don't plan on working here for many years...`
` After just a few years, ......or possibly...`
`......If Nee-san ever decides to stop working here, ......I think I'll stop working too......`
`"Kanon......kun......"`
`"............"`
`"If you give up on the miracle of magic and leave it to Shannon and George,`
` ......they will be joined and leave the island. `
`......After that, Kanon will leave the island as well.`
` That is an unavoidable fate."`
`"Th, ......then what if they can obtain the miracle of magic...?"`
`"Of course, Kanon will remain on the island, by Jessica's side for all time.`
` ......He will probably start learning music with Jessica as she wished for. `
`......How their relationship will progress afterwards is a matter for the two lovers.`
` They may deepen their relationship slowly all by themselves, as Jessica wanted..."`
`"......However,`
` ...if that happens, George-san and I will not be joined."`
`".........We must fight this fate `
`by betting our futures and our happiness."`
`"A, ......are you kidding me...?!`
` What the hell...?!`
` So if we are joined, the other pair will split apart?!`
` What kind of demon's game is this?!!"`
`"Don't be mistaken.`
` You will not be taking something from each other.`
` ......Without the power of the golden butterfly brooch, neither love is fated to bear fruit."`
`"A, and who the hell decided that?!!"`
`"It is due to your sin of falling in love with furniture, which is not allowed to love. `
`......Didn't Kanon clearly reject you, saying that furniture was not qualified to love?!`
` Knowing that, you chose Kanon as the one you loved.`
` I won't let you get away with saying you didn't know...!"`
`"............"`
`Though she couldn't accept any of it, Jessica was unable to argue back.`
` Then, George spoke up with that soft tone that he always used to smooth things over.`
`......However, his expression was still ruthlessly serious.`
`"......Jessica-chan,`
` can't you think of it this way?"`
`"Think of it......what way...?"`
`"I love Shannon.`
` I am prepared to overcome any and all trials and obstacles that stand in the way of us being together. `
`.........What about you?"`
`"W, well, ......I'm not so weak that I'd lose heart over most things..."`
`"Yes.`
` That's it exactly.`
` Right now, we are being tested.`
` Tested to see who can display the strength of our feelings more strongly."`
`".........Are you actually......satisfied with this insanity...?"`
`"There's no need to be satisfied.`
` ......When I gave Shannon that engagement ring, I swore to fight all trials and barriers that stand in my way. `
`......No matter how unreasonable or incomprehensible these trials might be,`
` ......I cannot choose to avoid them."`
`George spoke clearly, ......then looked at Jessica with a cold gaze.`
`......By now, Jessica almost understood.`
` If she kept on grumbling and avoiding this demons' trial,`
` ......the game between the two groups would automatically end with her defeat by default.`
` In other words, George and Shannon would win.`
` Then they would gain the miracle of magic, their love would be completed,`
` .........and Jessica and Kanon would split apart,`
` ......with Kanon eventually leaving the island and never seeing her again.`
`"......Nothing would make me happier `
`than to see you step out of this trial.`
` ......That way, I wouldn't have to fight you. `
`And that would show the limits of your feelings for Kanon-kun."`
`"Nn.........gah........."`
`It seemed as though George spoke ruthlessly, ......but he was actually being exceptionally fair.`
` If it came to a loss by default, Jessica would never be able to clear away her lingering regrets.`
` That would leave a bad aftertaste even for George.`
`"......We must fight openly for that single miracle. `
`......Even if I lose at the end,`
` ......I'll be able to accept it if we both gave it our all.`
` And because of that, I will be able to cheer on the victors from the bottom of my heart."`
`".........Hmph.`
` ...George's determination is quite impressive."`
`"After hearing that-"`
`"Are you still going to run away?"`
`The two demons giggled and challenged her.`
` Of course, George didn't laugh, but he still challenged her with cold eyes.`
`".........And Shannon......?"`
`"......Please forgive me, Milady.`
` ......I am determined not to flinch in my resolve. `
`.........Even if I know...`
`...that sticking to my feelings...`
`...means ending your loving relationship, Milady."`
`Shannon had never before spoken to Jessica with such serious and solemn words.`
` Jessica realized what a strong will had dwelt within her usually weak and clumsy friend, and was surprised.`
`"Kanon-kun........."`
`"I......want to start a new life with you, Milady. `
`......Even if that life...`
`......means crushing Nee-san's happiness...`
`...I will not falter..."`
`Kanon was also doing all he could to restrain himself.`
` Yes.`
` All of them...`
`...were being serious and frank...`
` and abandoning any naivety they might have possessed.`
` All this about golden butterfly brooches and miracles of magic...`
` And the trial that the demons were giving them...`
`...none of it mattered.`
` Only one thing was being tested.`
` Whether or not they possessed the strong will to make their love come true.`
` Jessica clenched her fists, ......and hung her head, shaking, while biting her lower lip.`
` She was silent, but she would probably gain an unswerving will of steel before too long.`
`......She just needed a little time first.`
` The two demons who taunted people with dramatic gestures...`
` did not violate this silence that Jessica needed to resolve herself.`
` Love brings about conflict, and this conflict gives rise to determination.`
` As the demons of love, they could understand more fully than any others how noble that determination was...`
`".........Jessica-san......"`
`"Furthermore, ......this magical miracle is something that can be received by you as well."`
`"By me too.........?`
` Wh, what......do you mean......?"`
`She had thought this had been about two pairs of lovers.`
` Beato was surprised to suddenly hear that this had something to do with her as well...`
`"With the miracle of the golden butterfly brooch, `
`.........even your wish,`
` ......your wish that your affection for Battler will be acknowledged, can be granted easily.`
` ......And without a miracle, `
`.........you also can never be bound to him."`
`"............"`
`"It means you're no outsider to this either."`
`"To cut across the marshes of love!`
` That is your wish, is it not?!"`
`"We will not make light of your wish!"`
`"......Even your relationship with Battler will eventually fester and rot. `
`......No matter how much of a positive outlook you take,`
` you know that this fate will eventually come to pass, barring some kind of miracle."`
`"............Well........."`
`Beato hung her head sadly.`
` She hadn't wanted to lose heart from that cookie incident.`
`......However, it would have been a massive lie to say that it hadn't hurt her...`
` The more she tried to get close to Battler, the more she hurt him.`
` However, she had been born in order to get close to Battler.`
`...She was like a hedgehog freezing in the cold and bunching together for warmth.`
` She had approached him because of love, and had been hurt for it......`
`"If you understand that much, entrusting your fate to a miracle may prove to be of some interest. `
`As they say, an un-bought lottery ticket earns you nothing. `
`Zepar, Furfur!`
` Let my little sister join in too."`
`"Oh, of course!"`
`"Welcome, second Beatrice...!`
` We were planning on including you from the very beginning!"`
`""After all, we are Zepar and Furfur!`
` The demons of love!!""`
`"......M, ......may I......join in as well......?"`
`"If you want to, I don't see a problem.`
` I won't prevent anyone from entering.`
` We'll win against all hindrances and make everyone celebrate our union. `
`......Of course, it's the same the other way around.`
` If you succeed in love by defeating us at our best,`
` then both Shannon and I promise to sincerely support the pair that wins.`
` Right, Shannon?"`
`"Yes.`
` We will not lose. `
`And even if we did, we would cheer you on from the bottom of our hearts."`
`"......I feel the same.`
` I will not lose."`
`".........Well, if there's no way out of this fight,`
` ......let's show 'em what we've got.`
` ......No matter what!`
` Kanon-kun and I don't plan on losing."`
`"You feel the same, do you not?"`
`"Y, ......yes... `
`......If there is even a small chance that Father...`
` ah...`
` no...`
`......that Battler-san will acknowledge me, `
`I'm willing to put myself on the line."`
`"Well said.`
` Good going, little sister. `
`Zepar, Furfur!`
` The actors have gathered!"`
`"Then let's begin, Furfur!"`
`"Yes, let us begin, Zepar!"`
`""Let's begin this trial of lovers, the fight over a single miracle of magic...!!""`
