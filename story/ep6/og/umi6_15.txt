`The entrance to the mansion was locked, but Erika had a master key, so she opened it without any trouble.`
` She had gotten Krauss and the others to take the master keys from the servants, `
`and at that time, she had used a little sleight of hand to pilfer one of them...`
`"Well THEN.`
` Where shall we go FIRST?"`
`"Why ask?`
` ......Let's go and hear Battler-san's answer."`
`Grinning, Erika cut across the entrance hall and passed in front of the dining hall......deeper...deeper.`
`......She headed for the guest room Battler had lain dead in.`
` Battler could put off deciding whether the seals would remain whole or not until the moment right before Erika witnessed them.`
` However, once she did witness them, ......the Game Master would have to show what had happened to them.`
` In the witch's game they were in now, ...the simple act of going to check the seals around the guest room was an attack.`
`".........Are you READY, Lord BATTLER?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Or as you would say it,`
` .........come, step forward."`
`"<Good>!`
` Then show us your response. `
`Well now, ......are the seals broken or are they not?`
` Has the closed room been preserved, ......or hasn't it...?!"`
`The piece Erika held high in the air......was the white queen, which represented herself.`
` Her target......was Battler's position.`
` She cut in...`
` Erika dashed down the hallway with a sickening smile and clung to the guest room door like a spider.`
` Then, she closely examined the seals she had placed retroactively.`
`"............Heh...`
`...heheheheheheheheeheheheheheehheh!`
` ......Are you sure...?`
` .........Are you sure, `
`...Battler-saaaaaaan...?!"`
`"I, ......is this alright, Battler-san...?"`
`"......Yeah, I can't back down here.`
` ......After all, even if I'm sealed in here, ......there are ways of placing the letter."`
`"But now, Erika will probably enter the guest room.`
` And then, she will observe your corpse.`
` ......What are you going to do?!`
` If the corpse is there, then there's no problem.`
` ......The letter's prediction missed, but it's not as though there's a penalty for that.`
` ......But still......you intend to fight head on...!"`
`"There are times...`
`...when a man is challenged head on...that he has to respond, no matter who the opponent.`
` ......I must not...pull back here.`
` ......I'll take that challenge.`
` I can search for a way out all I want to later...!`
` I managed to do that with Kinzo's study last time...! `
`......Don't worry...I can do it...! I can do it!! `
`Come on, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"{p:1:We have confirmed that the seals to the guest room are UNDAMAGED. `
`Since the time Lady Erika confirmed Battler's existence, this closed room has been PRESERVED.}"`
`"<Good>!! `
`I'm breaking the seals!!`
` Rip, tear!! `
`Heh, hehihihihihihihihihihihi!!!"`
`Erika destroyed the duct tape seal on the door in ecstasy...`
` It looked as though the intellectual rapist had finally laid her true nature bare.`
`"......Okay, `
`......I'm opening it......`
` Please watch... `
`...Here's Battler-san's...`
`...naked scenario...!! `
`Hehihihahahaahaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`Like a ruffian pushing down a weak girl,`
` ......Erika mercilessly and greedily threw the door open.`
` Then, finally, ......the inside of Battler's guest room was observed by Erika.`
` Battler had to show it.`
`.........Was there a corpse, or wasn't there?`
`"<Come ooooooooooooooon>, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, here's my respooooooonse!!"`
`Battler grabbed a black piece from the board and raised it high.`
`......Aah, ......that piece......`
` Beato had no memories of the time she had been an expert at this game.`
` And yet, ......for some reason, she realized that this was a move that could not be taken back.`
` Once this piece was moved, they couldn't move it back...!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
`......The guest room was covered by a silent darkness.`
` It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen.`
`......However, there was a light switch just off to the side of the entrance.`
` If she flicked that, the room would be lit up, and she would see whether or not there was a corpse on the bed.`
`".........Turning them ON."`
`"No, ......wait a second please.`
` ......Battler-san, I have a proposal."`
`"Let me hear it."`
`"I think you already know,`
` ......but this time around, I am not after a classic sort of victory.`
` ......My enemy is not the lowly culprit killing the pieces, ......but my opponent, you yourself."`
`".........I know.`
` ......So, ......you're after a logic error."`
`"Heheh......"`
`"......I'm seriously regretting it now.`
` ......You were acting so miserable that I fell for it completely, ......and I gave you a ridiculous privilege."`
`".........It was your PRIDE.`
` ......It will cost you DEARLY."`
`".........Damn......it......"`
`"......So, ...what is your proposal?"`
`With a firm voice, Beato urged her to continue.`
` Until just a second ago, she had remained behind Battler's back, a bit flustered.`
`......However, she was steady now.`
`......She saw that Battler had let his emotions take control and had been lured into making a bad move...`
`...and realized that it was time for her to stay cool and support him.`
` Erika's proposal couldn't be anything good.`
` And on top of that, Erika was sly.`
` She probably wouldn't make a proposal that would be easily rejected...`
`"I will now turn on the light.`
` The top of the bed will be lit up, and it will be decided whether or not Battler has disappeared as the letter predicted. `
`......If he's there, great.`
` There's nothing strange at all.`
` The letter's prediction would just be wrong.`
` ......Of course, the argument would probably switch over to 'then who put the letter there?',`
` but for the time being, the location of the fight would move outside this closed room."`
`"............And...if he's missing...?"`
`Beato already knew.`
` She knew the move that Battler had made a second ago.`
`......Battler had......already disappeared from this room......`
` Therefore, they would need to prepare a disappearing trick other than `
`'he was actually alive and left through the door'.`
` The situation is simple.`
` First, this room is a closed room.`
` Also, Battler's life or death status has not been confirmed.`
` In other words, there is no problem if he is alive.`
` They had to make Erika think that Battler had vanished from this situation.`
` He just had to escape from the room,`
` ......or if that wasn't possible, he just had to hide somehow and wait for her to leave, making her think that he had disappeared.`
`"Inside this tiny room, `
`......I will now begin our endgame...`
`......the chase after the king.`
` It should end in just a few moves.`
` You'll be unable to construct the logic needed to let Battler escape from this room,`
` .........and the tale will be destroyed--game over."`
`".........Fighting to keep that from happening is our job.`
` ......What is this proposal of yours?"`
`"An endgame fought over a logic error should be a bit more precise. `
`......Once again, we will fight with the red and blue truths,`
` but we need a referee on the same level as the Game Master to observe and see that he doesn't create any logic errors with the red truth."`
`"......Th, that seems reasonable."`
`"There's nothing special about this.`
` ......Back when the old you was the Game Master,`
` you were under the observation of your guardian, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` In that way, it was judged that all red truths were effective."`
`"......So, you're telling us to show Lambdadelta our cards?"`
`"I've been watching since the beginning. `
`......It's okay, don't worry.`
` I am impartial in my judgments."`
`"C, can you say that in red...?"`
`"Yep. `
`{p:1:I swear that I am impartial in my judgments.}`
` .........I was very impartial in the last game, wasn't I?"`
`"......Especially for interesting judgments where she doesn't care which way it falls.`
` .........Accept it, Battler.`
` Erika is going to corner you.`
` Understand? `
`.........She will duel with you and kill you in this room.`
` ......If you're a man, accept the duel......!"`
`"S, ......sure, fine.`
` .........We won't get anywhere if you suspect every single impossible murder I show of being a logic error.`
` ......It's true that we need an observer to guarantee that the game is legitimate."`
`"Then I'll come around to your side.`
` ......Let me take a look at your hand. `
`............Hmmmmm......?"`
`Lambdadelta understood what Battler had up his sleeve.`
`......And she confirmed that Erika's first move had indeed gone straight through his heart.`
` Just as Erika had guessed, `
`Battler was alive, had slipped out of the room after Erika had examined his 'corpse',`
` ......placed the letter by the guesthouse, and hid himself somewhere.`
` When the duct tape seals had been retroactively placed on the guest room,`
` ......he would have had to show that they had been torn.`
` However, if he had done that, it would be the same as admitting that he had been seen through and that he had lost.`
` Unwilling to admit that, Battler had claimed that the seals had been maintained, with false courage,`
` and was now rushing to revise his logic.`
` True, he could still escape for a few more moves.`
`......However, Erika was planning to corner and kill him here...`
`"......Battler.`
` ......You're fighting with some pretty incredible cards here."`
`"Cards...?`
` ......Does this game of chess look like a card game to you?"`
`"......To me, it looks as though you all are playing a game of poker.`
` So, by moving to this side and looking at the cards you hold, I understand everything. `
`.........That's an awful move.`
` It's a complete waste...`
` And Erika has already seen right through you."`
`"............Heheh...`
` What would you do?"`
`"I'm the referee. I can't give you advice.`
` ......But let me tell you my impressions."`
`"No, that's okay."`
`"......It's chilling. `
`......You're trying to use this useless move...`
`......this baseless bluff...`
`...to make Erika back down...`
` ...She's not going to back down, that girl.`
` ......After all, ...`
`...you're the one who should be throwing his chips in and folding now..."`
`"......Thanks for the advice.`
` .........Battler-san.`
` I agree with her. `
`......Let's back down from the fight in this room.`
` We don't have any winning cards..."`
`"Are you hoping for a card change to turn this into something more useful...?`
` ......I thought you were playing chess... `
`In the world of chess, ......if you rely on luck......you die......"`
`By 'hoping for a card change',`
` ......she meant relying on luck and hoping that, though he couldn't think of a trick now, `
`he might think of a good plan for making a closed room trick later on.`
` If you enter into the fight...`
`...without any trick in mind...`
`...you get killed...! `
`Now was the time to back down.`
` When Erika flipped the switch, `
`......he just had to be sleeping there on that bed.`
`......That's all......he needs!`
`"......Lambda.`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but you're chatting too much.`
` A referee needs to be impartial."`
`"True......`
` ......Then, good luck, Battler.`
` ......I'm hoping for a precise, chess-like battle. `
`......You aren't playing poker, ......are you......?"`
`"Are you ready, Battler-san?"`
`"Yeah, I am......`
` ......Turn the lights on whenever you want."`
`"For the rest of the fight in this room, the progression of time will be stopped.`
` This way, all the moves for both players will be made at the same time,`
` and the first move made will be treated no differently than the last move. `
`......That might be hard to understand, `
`but that's a rule to protect you and your logic."`
`"......From here on out, you can use all the twisted logic you want to rebuild the trick in this room.`
` ......In other words, it's possible that you might think of a good idea partway through the fight. `
`......Normally, it's unfair to revise your plot partway through.`
` In order for that to be acceptable, ......you need a world stopped in time, where everything happens at once, `
`......and where logic that you think of afterwards can counter your opponent's earlier moves."`
`"Of course, Erika can take advantage of this rule as well.`
` ......If you revise your trick to be a new one, she can deal with that in a different way."`
`".........This is pretty complicated..."`
`"It's simple.`
` ......It's like a corrupt politician's war of twisted logic.`
` ......You lie shamelessly.`
` When evidence is shown revealing that lie, you retract those previous lies and say that you just remembered it wrong, `
`then change to a new lie that doesn't have any contradictions. `
`......The fight goes between a lie, then evidence exposing it, then another lie,`
` ......like a fight between two snakes spinning around trying to eat each other's tails."`
`"<Good>!`
` ......Just think of it as a world in which you're allowed to use twisted logic based off of your opponents moves as often as you want. `
`......I used that myself when sealing this room.`
` So, I thought it was only fair to let you do the same."`
`"......You have no shame, do you...?"`
`"OK!!`
` Then let's have both sides begin! `
`Will Erika take the first move?`
` Will she start by checking the bed...by checking to see what he's bet?!"`
`"Yeah, let's start by checking to see if Battler's on the bed.`
` ......Erika, begin."`
`"Leave it to me, my master!`
` <Light>...<on>!"`
`With a *click*, `
`......the sound of the light switch rang out...`
`...and the bulb turned on, lighting up the room.`
`......On Battler's...`
`...bed...`
`...was......`
`".........Dlanor.`
` Confirm it with the red."`
`"YES.`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler-"`
`"No, it's my move.`
` ......I'll say it. `
`............{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not on the bed.}"`
`"<Good>.`
` .........I'm glad you didn't run away from the fight.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"......It's a high-stakes battle, so it'll cost you a lot if you're the one who loses.`
` Are you prepared...?"`
`"*giggle* No one would raise the stakes unless they felt confident in their advantage."`
`"......Dlanor.`
` Keep a record."`
`"As you WISH."`
`At Dlanor's nod, Cornelia, who was hanging back, started taking a record.`
` She wrote down that Battler's corpse, which should have been on the bed, was not,`
` ......and also that Battler hadn't backed down from this closed room game...`
`"As previously announced, Battler's first move is to have the corpse vanish.`
` ......Now it's Erika's turn.`
` Go ahead."`
`"......I present the possibility that Ushiromiya Battler is alive and hiding somewhere in this room.`
` I proclaim this with the blue truth."`
`"Ineffective.`
` If you want to use the blue truth, give me a specific location."`
`"......Pfft.`
` ......In the last game, Beato did that in Kinzo's study,`
` and Dlanor made Swiss cheese of her, right...?`
` I guess this is revenge...*giggle*..."`
`"Before I start searching, I have one blue truth I can use without a search. `
`{p:2:There is a possibility of a hidden door X that is impossible to discover. `
`He's hidden behind that, so it is impossible for me to find him.}"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 3rd. `
`It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.}`
` ......That right?"`
`"......`
`{p:1:No hidden places that are impossible for Erika-san to find exist inside the guest room.}"`
`"Knox's 3rd......EFFECTIVE."`
`"<Good>.`
` ......Then let's get started with the search."`
`......Erika slowly began to walk around the room......`
` Until the endgame had started, Erika had been energetic,`
` jumping about impatiently like a hungry dog.`
` However, `
`......now that it had actually begun...`
`......This was a stifling battle of wits...`
`...where each breath made her tense...`
` Even the quiet sound of the rain......was distracting......`
`"Now that I've searched the room, what is its layout?"`
`"......The guest room is divided into two rooms, the bedroom and the BATHROOM.`
` Lady Erika has currently searched the entire bedroom SECTION.`
` There is only one EXCEPTION."`
`".........I'll leave that one place be for the time being.`
` So, were there any irregularities discovered in the bedroom?"`
`"There were NONE. `
`{p:1:Except for one location, there is no one to be seen in the BEDROOM.}"`
`"......What's this 'except for one location' business?`
` Say it without being annoying."`
`"There's a reason a face-down card remains face down.`
` ......I'll turn it over if it's needed, so look forward to it. ......*giggle*."`
`After thoroughly checking the bedroom, ......Erika headed for the bathroom door.`
` Since he wasn't in the bedroom, it was natural to think that he was in the bathroom.`
` And, since the guest room was made up of two rooms, if Battler wasn't in the bathroom either...`
`...it would mean that he had managed to vanish from the closed room.`
`......Except for that single location which Erika had intentionally left unchecked......`
`"I'm checking the bathroom."`
`"......Lady Erika.`
` ......The sound of water can be heard from INSIDE.`
` Also, there is a faint HEAT."`
`"Ooh......?`
` ......Don't tell me he's taking a shower...`
` Is it locked or anything...?"`
`"No, it isn't locked.`
` Go ahead and open it."`
`"......Then, if you'll allow me."`
`Slowly......Erika put her hand on the doorknob on the bathroom door......`
`......She tried to push it open, but felt a strange resistance.`
` Of course, it wasn't the resistance of the lock.`
`......It felt......as though it had an unnatural load on it......`
` Out from the slightly open crack poured the hot air from the shower.`
` However, it was unlocked, so there probably wasn't anyone taking a shower.`
` After letting a dumbfounded expression rise to her face, Erika slammed into the door with her whole body, knocking it open...`
`"Hyaa?! `
`Wh, ...what?!?!"`
`As soon as she opened the door, a hot blast poured out on her.`
` Erika froze, unable to understand what had happened.`
` After falling backwards on her butt, she realized that boiling hot shower water was spewing out at her, and hard.`
`"Wh, `
`......what is this......?`
` ......What a crazy......prank......"`
`Cursing, Erika wrapped the blanket from the bed around herself, and tried to enter the bathroom once more.`
` This time, she was able to figure out what was going on.`
` It was......an elaborate prank.`
` A wire fixed the shower nozzle in place so that it pointed at the entrance.`
` The pressure and heat were turned up to the max,`
` so that anyone who went through the door would be met with a wave of hot water.`
` The pressure was very strong, which probably accounted for the weight she had felt when trying to push the door open.`
` She tried to make the nozzle point in another direction,`
` but not only was it fixed in place by the wire, `
`it was also fixed in a place high enough that Erika couldn't reach it with her height.`
` She tried to turn off the pressure, but that was also held in place by wires.`
` She couldn't manage anything with her bare hands.`
` She would have to get a tool that could cut the wires.`
` However, when she looked into the bathtub, which was filled with very hot water, `
`she saw a bundle of wires and some nippers that had been used to cut them lying at the bottom.`
` If she used that, she could turn off the pressure...`
`"......Ah, owowowowowowow!! `
`......Damn you...!!"`
`The blanket she had used to protect herself from the shower was getting more and more drenched with boiling hot water.`
` At this rate, she'd get burns even through the blanket.`
` She needed to turn the water off quickly...! `
`Right next to the bathtub, she saw a hanging long-handled body brush.`
`......Perfect...! `
`Erika used that to skillfully scrape the nippers up off the bottom of the tub.`
` Fortunately, it was a shallow western-style bathtub.`
` If it had been a deep Japanese one, it would probably have burned her badly.`
` Making sure not to touch the hot metal parts, she carefully took the nippers...`
`...and cut the wires around the faucet...`
`......Take that, ...and that...!`
`"*pant*, ...*pant*!`
` *pant*......*pant*!!"`
`She finally closed the faucet and the heat from the hot water storm died down.`
`......For a while, Erika was forced to cool her almost burnt arms under running water...`
`"......What a CALAMITY."`
`"Would you like a bath?`
` I can wash your face with this brush."`
`"Allow me to PASS."`
`"Oh. ......That's a SHAME."`
`Erika had finally regained enough of her composure to be abusive......`
` She closed the faucet completely, ......and silence returned to the bathroom.`
` After that, all that remained was Erika's heavy breathing.`
` She turned on the fan to get rid of the hot steam.`
` She had to leave the bathroom until that was finished.`
`......It was pleasant, like stepping into an air-conditioned room on a hot summer's day.`
`"......Now that was a ridiculous trap.`
` ...However, that wasn't here at the time I examined Battler's 'corpse'.`
` Therefore, the appearance of this trap proves that Ushiromiya Battler was alive. `
`......Well, I never thought he was dead anyway."`
`"......So he decided to openly show a card that had already been EXPOSED."`
`"Let's check the inside of the bathroom.`
` Was Battler seen?"`
`"NO. `
`{p:1:No one was seen in the BATHROOM.}"`
`"<Good>.`
` Now we've confirmed that, `
`{p:1:except for one location, Battler does not exist in any place inside the guest room.}"`
`"......Give that a rest.`
` Just where is this one exception?"`
`"A coffin.`
` .........Ushiromiya Battler's coffin, that is."`
`"......Ashes to ashes, the dead to their COFFINS."`
`".........You'll try to trap me in this room, right?`
` ......Okay.`
` Let's have it."`
`The silence that was complete except for the rain......was suddenly filled with the smell of gunpowder.`
` Though it was extremely quiet,`
` ......the room was filled with tension......as though you'd be sliced in half if you relaxed for an instant.`
` A cloud of gold butterflies gathered on the room's round table......and turned into a witch's chess board.`
` It was finally......time for the siege.`
`"Blue truth. `
`{p:2:You did not vanish from this room. `
`You just hid yourself to make it seem as though you'd disappeared from a closed room. `
`The place you are hiding......is the 'one exception' that I haven't investigated yet.}"`
`As Erika lightly raised her right hand, ......`
` a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness behind her,`
` ......flitted between the index finger and middle finger of Erika's raised hand, and became a white piece.`
` Then, .........she lifted it high into the air......`
`"{p:2:This is the one exception. `
`......The walk-in closet next to the entrance!!}"`
`*bang*!!`
`......Like a falling white lightning bolt, `
`......the white piece `
`hit the board...`
`...landing by a weak spot in Battler's formation......`
`"Yes, it is HERE...!!!"`
`With a crash, the door of the closet, which was just off to the side of the guest room's entrance, was impaled by a spear that represented the blue truth.`
` Dlanor had spun around and thrown it.`
` The door was completely pierced,`
` ......and the spear stuck in so deeply that if a human had been hiding in it, it would have pierced their chest as well.`
` ......Its still quivering handle was a testament to the force with which it had been thrown.`
`".................."`
`"{p:2:There are no places in which to hide other than THIS. `
`You are now hiding in HERE}."`
`".........What do you say, Battler-san...?`
` Have you been struck through the chest `
`for a literal Smothered Mate...?"`
`".................."`
`"......Battler-san.`
` ......It's our move now."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I thought it would be like that, Erika.`
` You intentionally left one spot open so you could stuff me into that coffin. `
`......It's the same move that trapped Kinzo in Natsuhi's room.`
` ......I saw this move coming."`
`"Oh, ......did you?`
` ......Then let's see your response.`
` ......But let me make a prediction."`
`"Let's hear it."`
`"......I'll checkmate you in just two moves from now.`
` That's my prediction."`
`"Then I'll make the same prediction. `
`......I'll checkmate you in just two moves."`
`".........Sounds interesting."`
`"......These predictions contradict each other.`
` .........Who will be the liar, I wonder......?"`
`The air burst and sparked.`
`......The silence would hurt one's skin.`
`"Then GO.`
` ......It is your TURN."`
`"......It's useless.`
` Your lowly coffin won't be able to trap Battler-san."`
`"Here's my response."`
`Slowly, `
`......Battler held his hand over the chess board.`
` A gold butterfly that had appeared from the darkness rested on Battler's finger and became a black piece.`
`......That black piece was the king, ......which represented Battler.`
`"............This is my response...`
` to your '{p:2:Battler is hiding in the closet}'...`
` ......Take this."`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler does not exist within the guest room. `
`......There are no exceptions, including the closet.}"`
`Like a black bolt of lightning this time,`
` ......Battler slammed his piece down on the white piece of Erika's that had cut deep behind his lines......crushing her piece.`
` It scattered like a golden spray and melted beautifully into the darkness `
`as a faint cloud of gold sparks drifted about......`
`"......I see, so he hid in the closet at first,`
` ......and then slipped out of the room while Erika was occupied by the shower!"`
`"It's the same technique he used to let Kinzo escape from the study in the last game.`
` Distract the observation of the observer, and disappear into the darkness."`
`"......<Good>.`
` Yeah, I'm sure you aren't. `
`......I'd already foreseen that move."`
`Next was Erika's turn.`
`......A gold butterfly popped into existence in front of Erika...`
`......and she grabbed it right out of the air.`
` She then lifted that hand into the air......and raised the white piece high.`
`"Let me announce a retroactive move. `
`This occurs back in the very beginning, right after I broke the seals and entered this room.`
` ......`
`{p:1:At that time, I immediately closed the door, reset the chain, and sealed this room.}"`
`"Objection. `
`{p:2:Gohda severed the chain back when the crime was first discovered. `
`Since the chain lock is not functioning, it is impossible to use it to create a seal.}"`
`"Objection overruled. `
`{p:1:Erika repaired the chain lock.}`
` ......See?"`
`"......Impossible.`
` ......How could she have repaired a brass chain?"`
`"It is possible to repair.`
` ......Have you forgotten, Beato?`
` The duct tape seals.`
` ......`
`{p:1:Erika used that duct tape to join the two cut ends of the chain together, 'sealing' them. `
`In other words, the chain was repaired by the duct tape, and this room once again became a closed room locked from the inside.}"`
`"O, objection.`
` Erika-san has already used up her duct tape seals, hasn't she...?!`
` She shouldn't be able to use them anymore...!"`
`"Objection overruled. `
`{p:1:The use of the duct tape wasn't limited by the number of strips, right? `
`It was by the number of rooms. `
`......The only restriction was to limit it to only three rooms. `
`......Erika chose this guest room to be one of those rooms. `
`So, Erika has the right to seal as many places as many times as she wants within this room.}"`
`"......Gah........."`
`"......That's right.`
` ......I...gave her permission to do that."`
`"This is what you get for your PRIDE.`
` ......Sympathy is the evil liquor that the proud are most fond of."`
`"So, `
`with this retroactive move, `
`{p:1:I proclaim that the chain lock has been repaired by the duct tape seal and has regained its original functionality. `
`And, thanks to that, I locked the room upon entering it and made this guest room a closed room from the inside once more.}"`
`The white piece Erika held aloft......represented the seal caused by the chain lock.`
` This move would draw out Battler's king and drag it to the guillotine.`
`"Die, Battler."`
`The piece for the chain lock was slammed down right at Battler's king's throat.`
`"Repeat it. `
`'The lock created by the chain is currently intact'."`
`"............!"`
`Battler's face contorted.`
`......Beato, who was watching from behind, grimaced even more.`
` This move......was very painful.`
` If his logic said that he had hidden in the closet until Erika left`
` and used the uproar in the bathroom to escape,`
` ......then the chain lock must have been unset.`
` In other words, he couldn't respond to this demand.`
` If he didn't respond, Erika would use the blue truth in her next move.`
` She would probably say 'you hid in the closet, then used the disturbance in the bathroom to escape.`
` Since you then couldn't set the chain lock from the outside, you left it undone'...`
` And she would be right.`
`......This was...checkmate.`
` As Erika had predicted, she would strike the finishing blow on the second move.`
`......And on top of that, she would probably use the disappearing Battler `
`to solve most of the crimes that were to follow.`
`......Losing the battle in this closed room would steal a major deciding piece from Battler...`
` But what if...`
`.........he responded to her demand? `
`What if he could say 'the lock created by the chain is still intact'? `
`That......would be fatal to Erika.`
` It had already been shown with the red truth that this guest room could only be made into a closed room from the inside.`
` So, ......this hopeless closed room would instead become Erika's coffin.`
` For a riddle like this, Erika probably wouldn't solve the mystery of Battler's disappearance until the end.`
` Each unsolved riddle gives an advantage to the witch side.`
` Battler......`
` wanted to respond to this demand if at all possible.`
` However, ......if he responded...`
` If he answered by saying that the chain was still set...`
`......He would have to abandon the logic saying that he had escaped while Erika wasn't looking.`
` Once he escaped, he wouldn't be able to set the chain lock again.`
` It would make a riddle to corner Erika, but he would have to construct a different escape method.`
` Even a move such as him leaving the closet during the scene in the bathroom and hiding in another place--say, under the bed--`
`wouldn't work because he had proclaimed that '{p:1:Battler does not exist within the guest room}'.`
` If he could construct logic that allowed him to escape from here while preserving the chain lock's position,`
` .........then Erika would be the one facing a fatal blow.`
` However, ......if he didn't have that logic......if he failed...`
`...it would be a logic error.`
` The worst and lowest forbidden move that would instantly end the game in his defeat.`
` He would have no way to recover.`
`.........For Battler, ......deciding how to respond to this demand...`
`...was a very advanced and difficult decision......`
` Either way, ......Erika would probably corner Battler.`
`"......In that case, ......my choice is obvious."`
`"B, ......Battler-san.`
` ......This guest room has already been restricted in many ways by the red truth due to its closed room nature.`
` ......How do you plan on escaping from this...?!"`
`".........If only I could do something about the chain lock......`
` ......If only......"`
`If he could somehow trick the matter of the chain lock,`
` ......he could make Erika have to deal with a terrible closed room! `
`It would probably end up as a finishing blow to her.`
` But in order to do that, he would need to make a trick for escaping `
`'the closed room that existed before Erika came back', `
`which was now 'the closed room sealed by the chain that Erika set right after entering the room',`
` and on top of that, he had to make sure that 'the chain that could only be set from the inside remained in place'...! `
`If he could do that...if he could find a way...`
`...then it would end here...! `
`But I still can't think of that trick...! `
`Right now, Erika is demanding to know whether the chain lock is still set or not.`
` I need to decide whether I'll take that challenge or back down...and I need to do it right now...! `
`If I can find a certain-win trick, then this is the end...! `
`But if I don't have that trick,`
` ......I should just acknowledge that I slipped out of the closet, undid the chain, and escaped...and back out of the fight......`
` If I say the chain was set without a trick up my sleeve,`
` ......then it's impossible for me to escape.`
` In other words, it's a logic error......!!`
`"Even if we lose the fight in this room, there will still be chances left to us.`
` We've still only started the second day, haven't we?`
` We have plenty of time to reconstruct an impossible murder."`
`"......No, that's no good.`
` If I acknowledge that I've escaped from this room now, it's the same as acknowledging that I'm the culprit!`
` ......If I back down from the fight in this room, ......it's the same as accepting my defeat in this game."`
`Battler's point was a valid one.`
` Since all of the other humans were still locked in the guesthouse...`
` then if Battler alone was alive and free to move...`
` Erika would probably base her explanation for all of the following impossible crimes on the blue truth that Battler was the perpetrator.`
` If they wanted to forcefully turn that around, they would have to rewrite their tricks and logic so that 'someone other than Battler' would be set up as the perpetrator.`
` To fix up one flaw, they would have to create new flaws,`
` ......and the flaws might eventually pile up and kill Battler.`
` Even running away would mean tightening the noose around his own throat.`
` The first truth...that Battler is the culprit...has already been hit upon! `
`And yet, I have to struggle desperately to get out of this......! ...I need to...!! `
`I'm on the edge.`
` I've definitely been cornered in a dangerous spot.`
` However, ......if I can just change my position, everything might turn around at once...`
` If I can just make this chain my weapon......`
` I can kill Erika...!!`
`"Wait, ......are you actually going to respond to her demand...?!`
` Is there any way to escape without undoing the chain lock?! `
`.........There isn't!`
` If you respond, ......you'll lose instantly from the logic error at the end!`
` It's clear which choice we ought to make!"`
`"Yeah, it's clear.`
` .........No matter what move we choose, it'll turn for the worst just as Erika wants.`
` ......If it's horrible either way,`
` ......I'd like to choose the move that has the biggest reward if we win......!"`
`".........You're going to call even though you have no logic for escaping and no trump cards?`
` ......You think you can accept her demand and win...?!"`
`"My cards might be useless.`
` ......However, ......with just one more card, they might become a straight, a flush,`
` ......or even a royal flush.`
` .........If hell waits for me after both options, `
`......I'll take the one that'll finish her off if I win...!"`
`"Th, ......that's an insane move.`
` ......Sometimes, when madmen jump into the path of death, `
`.........a miracle will occur......"`
`"It's impossible!!`
` H, ......how could you escape this closed room without removing the chain?!!"`
`"......There's only one difference between heroes and madmen.`
` ......It's whether they win or lose. `
`.........I'll be looking forward......to your big victory......"`
`If I can finish things with this move, .........then as I predicted,`
` ......I can kill Erika on my second move.`
` I still can't think of a trick for escaping this closed room.`
` However, ......there has to be something......there has to......`
` Once I think of that, ......I can make a magic illusion of me changing into a butterfly `
`and slipping out of the crack in the door like smoke...`
`......If I have even a drop of that mad magician's blood in my veins,`
` .........please let that honor...`
`...give me just a fragment of a miracle right now......!`
`"......So, Battler-san?`
` Let's have that second move that you predicted you would checkmate me on."`
`"Please give an answer to Lady Erika's DEMAND.`
` ......Will you RESPOND, ......or will you REFUSE...?!"`
`Slowly......`
`...Battler's hand stretched out to his king piece on the board.`
` He lifted it up...`
`......and slowly...`
`...held it aloft...`
`...tracing a large circle in the sky......`
` Would Battler respond......or wouldn't he? `
`Would the lock caused by the chain be preserved, or wouldn't it?`
`......Would Battler's king crush the piece of the chain lock that stood right in front of it...?`
`......Or would it slip away like a ghost......and escape......`
`"This is......my response.`
` ......As predicted, ......on my second turn...`
`......you're through. `
`.........Here it comes. `
`......Furudo...`
`...Erika...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"`
`Battler's king had become a black lightning bolt and crashed down onto the board...`
` Where had it gone?! `
`On top of the piece of the chain lock? `
`Or past that piece...?`
`".........I will repeat it. `
`{p:1:The lock caused by the chain is intact.}"`
`Battler's king...`
`......had left the chain lock piece in its place...`
`......and had `
`slipped past it`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh......`
` ......Yeah, it sure would be cool if you could say that the chain lock was still set, wouldn't it......? `
`Don't you think that'd be cool......?`
` ......But do you know what they call a fool `
`who's full of himself and jumps into the path of death just because it's cool......?"`
`"......No clue......"`
`"Ushiromiya...Battler.`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` That's `
`what `
`we `
`call `
`them `
`aaaahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`I file a motion for a logic error!!"`
`"That red truth of yours just now has cut off your own logic!! `
`Please have the impartial referee make her judgment immediately!! `
`Great Lady Lambdadeltaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Motion received.`
` ......Lambdadelta.`
` Does this make logical sense? Your inspection please."`
`"Motion received. `
`.........Battler.`
` .........Show me.`
` Let me see......your cards........."`
`".........Battler......san........."`
`"......It is a royal flush...`
` right......?`
` If you've got nothing, `
`......you won't get out of this with just a 'sorry', okay......?"`
`"............`
`......Yeah.`
` I have no intention of apologizing."`
`"......If it's a logic error, the game board will be blown away.`
` ......You have inherited this game board from Beato.`
` .........It's the one thing you have left `
`of that precious Beato.`
` So, you must not accept a logic error."`
`A logic error only becomes established when the witch admits to it.`
` As long as they can keep thinking of new logic to escape with, ......they will not die, cannot die.`
` However, ......that would be like living in an endless living hell of the mind.`
`"......Even if you manage to crawl around forever after falling onto the darkness of thought,`
` ......you'll just be eternally trapped in a hell where you constantly think of ways to escape the closed room while denying the logic error.`
` ......Are you sure?! Are you sure?!`
` This is nearly as bad as the depths of oblivion, got it?!?!`
` It's like the difference between falling from the roof of a ten story building and falling from the roof of a hundred story building!!"`
`".........Lambda.`
` Battler has already finished making his move.`
` Players can't take back a move once it's made.`
` ......Act as an impartial judge, carry out our motion,`
` and see whether or not Battler's escape from the closed room is logical...and whether there has been a logic error or not."`
`"Be slow, accurate, and meticulous like an archeologist.`
` ......And, be as fast as a guy at an ice cream shop when he forcefully and skillfully scoops out that sweet, fragrant vanilla/soy sauce ice cream!!!"`
`"Y, ...yes, I know that. `
`.........Battler...`
`...let me see it."`
`"............Battler-san......"`
`"Beato, ...do you think I'll lose?"`
`"......I don't want to think that.`
` ......After fighting with the old me many times, `
`......you finally reached the miracle that I so wanted you to find. `
`......So, ......I'd like to believe...`
`.........that you'll win through a miracle once again...!"`
`".........This woman called Beatrice...`
` ...The whole time...`
`...she fought on that same border between reason and madness.`
` ......She fought with a mixture of sadness, anger, and several other emotions for me that can't be described with words. `
`.........And in the very last game...`
`......at the very last moment...`
`...she managed...`
`...to seize victory."`
`That might......have been the purpose of the card Beato had been gripping as she fell.`
` Beato passed away...`
`...without realizing `
`that she had won.`
` In the final game...`
`...the true victor......`
` was Beato......`
`"That Beato entrusted me with this game board.`
` ......So, I'll win. `
`......So, I need you alone to believe in me.`
` ......Beatrice..."`
`"If I believe, ......and a miracle occurs..."`
`"............Please."`
`"I do believe in you......!!`
` Battler-san...!!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, this is pissing me ooooooooooooff!!! `
`Please just check it already, Lady Lambdadelta!!`
` There is no valid logic!`
` There doesn't exist any way to get out of this closed room!!`
` You were overeager, Battler-san!`
` If you could win with this, that'd be cool!"`
`"It'd be so cool if you vanished even though the chain is still set, wouldn't it?`
` Kyaaaaaaaaaaaahhahhaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Like hell you caaaaaaaaaaaannn!! `
`Like hell you can do iiiiiiiit!!`
` If you could do that, you really would be a witch!`
` If you could vanish your way out of this closed room like a puff of smoke, I'd have to acknowledge it!`
` It'd be the work of a wiiiiiiiitch!!!"`
`"Quiet, Lady Erika!`
` ......Lady Lambdadelta is conducting her INSPECTION."`
`"...............`
`.........Pass through, one move.`
` ...Go back,`
` ......corner."`
`With sweat gathering on her forehead, ......Lambdadelta inspected the movements of the pieces from Battler's side.`
` She was as accurate and meticulous as an archeologist, ......just as Bernkastel had told her to be.`
`"............"`
`After gulping stiffly, `
`......Lambda looked between the formation of the pieces on the board...`
`...and Battler's face, `
`which remained tense but steady.`
`"......Lambda.........?"`
`".........I have...`
`...finished my inspection......"`
`"There's no way the logic works......!"`
`".........Please......God......"`
`"............"`
`".........Erika."`
`"What...?"`
`"I'm very sorry."`
`"Wh, ......which way am I supposed to take that...?!!"`
`"It was fun.`
` ......Now, this is the end."`
`"I told you, ......which way am I supposed to take thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!!"`
`"Silence!!`
` I have finished inspecting Battler's move.`
` .........My decision-"`
`{a:c: `
`"......Effective."}`
`"E...ffective.........?"`
`"......You're lying...!!"`
`"I judge it to be effective.`
` ......He's presented logic that doesn't violate any of the red truths, and I've finished checking it. `
`......The move by the player on the witch side, along with that final red truth he repeated, is effective.`
` .........Battler.`
` For the first time, ......I have to say I think you're incredible..."`
`".........See?`
` ......In your game, ......a miracle will always occur if you believe."`
`"B, ...Battler...san......!!`
` I...I'm sorry...!!`
` If only I had believed more strongly, ......you wouldn't have been cornered like this......!! Waaaaaaaahh!!"`
`Beato flew onto Battler's chest, sobbing...`
` Erika staggered backwards, ......shaking her head back and forth dizzily.`
` And Bernkastel...?`
`.........Her face was like an expressionless mask.`
` Then, ......slowly...`
`...it became a smile...`
` And for some reason, `
`......it seemed the sign of some horrible emotion......`
`"Well......DONE......`
`......To think...`
`...that you escaped the room...`
`...without removing the chain...`
`...simply SPLENDID......"`
`With her small hands, Dlanor slowly started to applaud quietly.`
`......She was followed by Gertrude, and then Cornelia.`
`......And then by Beato and Lambdadelta too.`
`.........Applause......filled the room......`
`"O......Onii-chan......`
` ......H, ......how did you......"`
`"......I see.`
` ......Yes, a move that cannot be seen by one whose thoughts are trapped within the closed room..."`
`"Impossible...`
`......Im...`
`...possible...... `
`......Eee...`
` eeeeeeeeeeek.........!"`
`As Lambdadelta watched Erika, who was breathing hard, shocked and dizzy with a despair she couldn't accept,`
` ...she had to take her hat off to the strength of Battler's heart and intelligence at this critical moment......`
` and to the power of this miracle.`
`......Incredible, ......Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's my complete loss for thinking that your power and Beato's would cancel each other out and bring an eternal draw.`
` And, ......Bern, who thought she could do as she pleased `
`even though she had seen through to your true strength, `
`......has also suffered a complete loss.`
` Bern is the witch who waits for miracles.`
` You are the witch who summons miracles.`
`......You...`
`...are not Bern's piece.`
`......Just now, `
`......without a doubt...`
`...you have surpassed Bern......`
`......You really did...`
`...in this one moment...`
`...think up a trick by which to escape from this closed room......! `
`As Erika had predicted, ......Battler had been hiding in the closet.`
` Then, during the disturbance in the bathroom, he had snuck out of the door.`
` ......Erika had guessed this much.`
` That's why they retroactively set the chain lock and sealed it to prevent Battler from doing this very thing.`
` The chain lock cannot be reset from the outside.`
` So, it should have been impossible to escape from the closed room.`
` However, ......Battler didn't let his thinking get trapped inside this closed room, `
`......and so, he broke through.`
`......It doesn't matter who, ......but let's explain it with his mother, Kyrie's piece.`
` Just like Battler, the life or death status of the rest of the first twilight victims has not been specified by the red truth.`
` In other words, ......just like Battler, `
`......the others...and specifically, Kyrie, can still move.`
` And their closed rooms were not sealed, so they can go out as they please.`
`......Kyrie......had come to save him.`
` Kyrie followed behind Erika, ......and had waited in the hallway while the latter had entered the guest room and sealed the door from the inside.`
`......Then, after Battler undid the chain lock and escaped,`
` .........she entered the room in his place......`
` Then, ......Kyrie reset the chain lock from the inside, `
`......and hid in the closet, ......just like Battler had done......`
` Yes.`
` ......Battler truly isn't inside this guest room right now.`
` However, that doesn't mean that no one else is inside it.`
`......Kyrie took Battler's place in the closet, `
`......the one exception that Erika had left, and is there still......`
` Kyrie...`
`...saved Battler.........`
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:`
`USHIROMIYA KYRIE `
`CANNOT SAVE BATTLER`
`}.}`
`......Huh......?`
`"Wh, ......what do you mean......?"`
`"......`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kyrie......cannot save Battler.}"`
`"...Wh, ......why not?`
` There's no red saying that Kyrie can't save Battler!`
` Wait a second, ......how are you using the red truth?!"`
`"Effective.`
` .........Dlanor's red truth is effective."`
`"Requesting permission to unsheathe red key."`
`".........Permission granted. `
`Please do it, Dlanor."`
`"H, .........how......? `
`......How...can you give that permission?!?!"`
`"Effective.`
` ......As part of an impartial judgment, I guarantee this red truth."`
`"......Without telling us your reason?!"`
`"We'll tell you that soon.`
` ......Very soon."`
`"...B, ......Battler hasn't proclaimed Kyrie dead with the red truth yet...!`
` It is allowed for Kyrie to be playing dead!`
` And the duct tape has already been used on three rooms, making it impossible for you to seal Kyrie's room...! `
`So how can you use the red truth to say that Kyrie can't save Battler?!`
` That red truth has no basis!!"`
`"We'll tell you its basis soon.`
` ......But more importantly, Lambda......?`
` ......The logic with Kyrie has ceased to function.`
` ......You should probably find another piece to switch places with Battler, don't you think...?"`
`"..................Nn, `
`......y, `
`...yes. `
`......There are still pieces that can save Battler."`
`Reconstruct the logic.`
`......All we need is someone who can switch places with Battler. It doesn't have to be Kyrie.`
`"Then let's switch it to Natsuhi. `
`......Ushiromiya Natsuhi switched places with Battler...!"`
`"Dlanor. ......Do it."`
`"As you WISH."`
`Dlanor's red longsword......smashed Natsuhi's piece into little bits...`
` How...?! `
`How...`
`...can Erika deny this logic...`
`...without the detective's authority?!`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi cannot save Battler.}"`
`"Th, then Eva! `
`Ushiromiya Eva!!"`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva cannot save Battler.}"`
`"Then Rosa!`
` Maria!!"`
`"{p:1:USELESS. `
`Rosa and Maria can't save him EITHER. `
`......DEATHDEATHDEATHDEATH`
`DEATHDEATHDEATHDEATH`
` <Die the death>! `
`<Sentence to death>!`
` <Great equalizer is the death>!!}"`
`"O, objection!`
` Erika-san doesn't have the detective's authority!`
` ......How can she use any red except for the duct tape seals...?!"`
`"Objection overruled.`
` ......Not having the detective's authority does not imply that one cannot use any red at all. `
`.........There's something she can use.`
` ......Right?"`
`"Yes, ......there is.`
` There are several exceptions that even humans without the detective's authority can use."`
`"......Insane...`
` ......There's no way."`
`"YES, there is NONE. `
`......However, ......there is a certain action permissible only to humans without the detective's authority,`
` ......and it can become a truth of such overwhelming credibility that `
`witches can easily raise it to the level of red TRUTH."`
`"A certain action...`
`...permissible only to humans who aren't the detective......?"`
`"............Y, ......you don't mean...`
` ...Erika......you..."`
`"......I...I've got it. `
`......Yes, ...if I'm right...`
` this red truth is effective..."`
`"I...I don't understand!`
` Was there some power that could only be used without the detective's authority...?!"`
`".........There is.`
` ......There is just one."`
`"So, you've finally noticed.`
` ......That's right.`
` ......That's the only reason...I abandoned the detective's authority this time around. `
`......You told me I could make the detective proclamation whenever I wanted, right?`
` ......Well, unfortunately,`
` ...I am no longer capable of making that proclamation."`
`"Which...`
`...number rule was it......?"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 7th.`
` .........It is...`
` forbidden for the detective to be the culprit.}"`
`"Y, you mean...`
`......wh, ......whaaat?!"`
`......Finally, Beato realized everything.`
` Yes, ......the detective's authority bestows several powers that are useful for reasoning,`
` but it eliminates one single privilege.`
` That is Knox's 7th.`
`......It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit...`
`"......In this game,`
` ......it is impossible for humans without the detective's authority to examine corpses perfectly.`
` ......So, ......there have been several tricks where the dead have all been faking and walking around where they please.`
` ......You probably thought you could use that logic to create several impossible crimes after this.`
` ......When I said that I wouldn't make the detective proclamation,`
` somewhere on the inside, you must have said 'I've won'."`
`"......You're pretty sly yourself.`
` You gave me the duct tape seals, seemingly out of mercy,`
` but that was because you planned to have all of the first twilight victims survive, band together, and carry out the crimes.`
` So, you gave me only three rooms' worth, which wouldn't cover all six people."`
`"No matter which rooms I sealed, at least one of your underlings could move freely.`
` .........You must have been plotting to use that to corner me. `
`......But too bad.`
` Your naivety really pisses me off.`
` ......Stupid man!"`
`"............I admit it.`
` ......I admit that I fell for your monkey show...`
` and that in my pride, I tried to show you some mercy. `
`.........That's right.`
` ......Even without the detective's authority, ......there is a way.`
` ......A way to make sure that a corpse examination cannot fail."`
`Is the human lying in front of you alive or dead? `
`You can answer that question by examining the corpse.`
` With just a quick glance, your chances of being right are 50-50 either way.`
` Various bits of knowledge and experience can be used to obtain a more precise result.`
`.........However, no matter how much you do that,`
` while you can reach up to 99%, you can never reach 100% accuracy.`
`......That's what most people would think.`
` However, there is one way.`
`......One way to conduct a perfect examination.`
`"And that is...`
`......to kill them."`
`".........Erikaa...aa......"`
`"Without the detective's authority, I can't tell whether the victims are dead or faking.`
` So, I needed a way to be sure. `
`......And, if possible, `
`it would be preferable if they were removed from the game board `
`so that they couldn't make a mess of things later on."`
`"So, I dashed all over the mansion, `
`visited all the crime scenes, `
`and......`
`{p:1:I re-killed all of them.}"`
`"Wh......what on...earth........."`
`".........Of course, she couldn't just kill them however she liked.`
` ......It had to be a perfect way of killing, good enough that their deaths could be determined with the red truth.`
` ......Erika made sure of that."`
`"The manner in which they were each killed differed,`
` ......but afterwards, `
`{p:1:she completely severed the heads of all those she killed.}`
` ......That method of killing is solid enough to be called a red truth, right...? Lambda......?"`
`"......E, .........effective.`
` No human could survive...`
`......after having their head sliced off...!"`
`"C, could you have severed all of those heads without getting any blood on you?!"`
`"For example, you could take a large trash bag from the kitchen and grab the knife through it.`
` ......Then, if you covered the entire corpse with the trash bag as you did your work, you'd block nearly all of the blood spatter."`
`I used enough knives and bags for several people, then left them there at the crime scene.`
` Of course, I didn't humiliate myself by walking around with them, leaving blood in the hallways and dirtying my clothes.`
` There will probably be trash bags left at the crime scene with my fingerprints on them,`
` but since this game ends before the police come, that can't be used as evidence, `
`so there was no problem with leaving them there.`
`"......Are you insane? `
`......What kind of...`
` mystery would...`
` ever allow something like that......?"`
`"I can't believe I'm hearing this from a witch on the fantasy side.`
` Oh, and don't worry.`
` I didn't kill you.`
` ......I didn't have time to sever the head of the last one found, `
`so I just sealed your whole room with the duct tape you gave me."`
`"......Then again, that might've been because I knew this would happen and wanted to watch you struggle.`
` .........*giggle*, `
`......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`Oh, that's right.`
` ......Just like I can say that I killed them in red, I can say one more thing."`
`At that point, Erika stopped for a second,`
` ......and still, `
`...aaah, can she really be wearing an even uglier expression than everything before now......? `
`With that...`
` highest quality face, ......she spoke.`
`"{p:1:All five people I killed......were very much alive until the moment I killed them.`
`} ......Everyone faithfully played dead as best they could until the moment just before I killed them, okay? `
`.........Maria-san was quite the little trouper.`
` .........After all, even though her mother had already been killed in the same room,`
` ......she kept on playing dead without even noticing......`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*-"`
`"Hahahahaha, `
`ahhahahahahahahahahaha...`
` hehahyahhahahahaahahaaahaaaah!!"`
`――They're demons.`
` Up until now, `
`......many witches and demons have appeared in this tale, `
`......but for the first time...`
` here are true...`
` demons......`
`"You bastards......`
`...you bastards......`
` ...Uu......uugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!"`
`This time, Beato understood the entire plot of this tale.`
` This tale......was just the story of a prank.`
` Surely, someone had thought of playing a slightly harsh trick on this inconsiderate guest, `
`who loved to show off her intelligence and act the part of a great detective...`
`...and several people had agreed to go along with it.`
` Then, the ones who would play the victims would go into their assigned rooms, set the chain and the lock from the inside,`
` ......and play dead......to create a fake closed room murder......`
`......If you think about it that way, the rooms chosen for the corpses seem to make more sense.`
` It was only natural for Natsuhi to 'die' in her own room.`
`......If you're going to play dead, it's only natural that you'd want to lie down on your own bed.`
` Eva's vanity is strong, so she must have asked to 'die' in the VIP room.`
` Kyrie was in Krauss's study.`
`......That was probably well air-conditioned and comfortable.`
` Rosa and Maria were in the parlor.`
` A soft sofa should have been a great place to play dead.`
`......Maria had done her best and had impressively acted the part of lying dead alongside the wall.`
` Battler was in a guest room.`
` The temperature here was also nice.`
` The bed must also have been fairly pleasant.`
`...Yes.`
` The victims for this first twilight had all died in comfortable rooms.`
` In the past games, the corpses had often been found exposed in the courtyard or under the rose garden arbor.`
` In the cold gardening shed or in the boiler room......`
` This time, there were no victims in any such inhospitable environments.`
` This...`
`...is probably the truth.`
` This is the story of a prank, with no one dead since it started...`
` And then...`
`......this......demon...`
`......had turned it into a real murder case......!`
`"......You do have the right to speak ill of Lady Erika. `
`......However, ......now, you also have the obligation of showing a new logic that doesn't lead to any CONTRADICTIONS."`
`"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.`
` Corpses to corpses...!`
` Hey, Battler-san? Let's continue the game!!`
` Please present a different human to switch places with you.`
` If you don't, your trick......will become a logic error......"`
`There's now......no one who can come to the rescue.`
` Erika's killed all of them!!`
`"D, ......dammit......dammit, dammit, dammiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......Battler-san, please, calm yourself...!`
` Now's the time to wipe our tears away and fight...! `
`Even if you've lost five pieces who can save you, there's still the 11 people in the guesthouse!"`
`"Y, you're right...`
` ......Krauss, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, ......George, Jessica, Shannon, Kanon!`
` Genji, Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo!! `
`It doesn't matter who, as long as someone comes here!! `
`Somebody, somebody, heeeeeeeeelp!!"`
`"But it's no uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse!! `
`Please, looook at thiiiiiiiiiis! `
`Gertruude, `
`Corneliaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`""Let it be known that we are here and ready.""`
`"Bwaattleeer-shwaaaaaann!! `
`Pweease, look at thiiiiiiiiiisss!!`
` Whhhaaaaat arrrre theeeesse?!"`
`Erika, who was now so excited that her pronunciation was tumbling all over the place, `
`pointed at two doors.`
` It was the hallway on the second floor of the guesthouse...`
`......They were in front of the cousins' room and the next room over.`
`"Look, here, here! `
`There's something attached to the door?!`
` What is it?! What is it?! `
`Hey, what is it, Gertruuuuuuuuuuuude?!"`
`"......Know that it is the duct tape seal of the cousins' room."`
`"<Oh, yeeeeeeeeaah>!!`
` <Very goooooooooooood>!!`
` <One more>!! `
`What about this dooooooooooooooor?!?!"`
`"Know that it is the duct tape seal of the next room over."`
`"Ｏｈ、ｖｅｒｙ　ＧＯＯＤ!!`
` Okay, you two!`
` Why don't you show everyone watching at home on their TVs?!!`
` Please have a look at the duct tape seals on both doors!! `
`So, what do you think of them...?!`
` Are they broken, or aren't they...?`
` Please, let us have the red truth!!"`
`""{p:1:Please, allow me to speak.`
` Know that neither is broken.}""`
`"{p:1:Know that an unbroken seal proves that there are still none who have entered or exited.}"`
`"{p:1:It needs no second telling, but know that entry or exit without breaking the seal is impossible!!}"`
`"Ｇｏｏｄ. `
`...Battler, it is as you SEE.`
` ......There no longer exists anyone who can save YOU."`
`The victims of the first twilight have all been killed! `
`And the guesthouse is still sealed!! `
`No one can come to the rescue...!!`
`"Uu...`
` ku...`
` gghh.........!"`
`Erika had guessed this moment might happen so long ago,`
` ......and that was why she had made the strategic move of suddenly sealing these two rooms.`
` This accounted for the doubts Cornelia had felt at the time.`
` Wondering why the human side player wouldn't want as many free humans as `
`possible was a natural, simple reaction to that move.`
` However, if you sealed up all humans, `
`......there would be no room for magic to intervene.`
` Why is magic magic? `
`Because the people who saw it say that it was magic.`
` Then, is it possible for magic to exist in a place with no people?`
`......Is there no problem with that because there's no anti-magic toxin...? `
`Wrong!`
` Magic in a place that isn't being witnessed is no different from a delusion, a daydream! `
`Magic that matches a result must be carried out by human hands.`
` If all humans are sealed off, then magic cannot be created.`
` This was Erika's strategy for this game......and her beautiful...checkmate!!`
`"Well now.`
` ......Who's going to come save you?`
` Please tell me who the 'real' person is who switched places with you, remained in the guest room in your place,`
` and set the chain lock from the inside.`
` If they even exist."`
`".........Okay, Battler...?`
` Your logic has been interrupted.`
` ......Who could have come to save you?`
` You are now in the middle of a logic error."`
`"Uu...`
`......w, `
`......wait...`
` I'm still......thinking......!"`
`"......Battler, you have two options and one obligation.`
` ......The first option is to build a new thread of logic to reconstruct your closed room trick.`
` The second is to come clean and admit to your logic error.`
` And your obligation is to choose one of these options."`
`"It is merciful.`
` There's no restriction on the amount of time you have to make that choice. `
`.........*giggle*, that's right, your time is endless, eternal."`
`"I...I'm sure there's still some way...`
`...some twisted logic that can get you out of this...`
` ...Anyway, ...I'm sure there's still some way......!"`
`"I'm thinking about it!`
` What about you, Beato?! `
`......Let me know if you find anything...`
` ......I'm sure the old Beato...could have managed something...`
` She built up several closed rooms like this...!!"`
`Beato felt awful...`
`......Why was she Beato, and yet not?! `
`Surely, the old her would have thought up a trick under these restrictions.`
` If only she could do that, she could guide Battler to victory......but she couldn't do it as her current self!`
`"*giggle*.`
` Yeah, I'm sure you'll think of a good trick.`
` Eventually, surely, probably, maybe. `
`......Pretty sure it's impossible though. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......So then, Battler.`
` ......Let's go back to the guest room.`
` From now on, that will be your world."`
`Once again, ......they returned to the slightly chilly guest room.`
` It was the same room as before, of course, `
`......but it felt as though an unsettling darkness had crept in...`
`"Here's the room you'll spend your days in from now on.`
` .........You just need to escape from this room by any means you want."`
`"......However, there are conditions.`
` ......As I believe you know, these were all things you forced on yourself.`
`......First, `
`{p:1:this room is a closed room created from the inside. `
`The seals on the windows are intact, so there can be no escape from there. `
`Of course, there is no way to escape by leaving through the bathroom. `
`......I'll make it simple. `
`There is no exit to escape from except for this door. `
`However, the chain lock on this door is set. `
`You can unset and reset it all you want, but you can only do so from the inside. `
`Furthermore, you are free to go out through the door, but you cannot leave or escape while the chain lock is unset.`
` }You have to show that you can escape from this room with the chain lock still connected......!!"`
`"......But...`
`...he couldn't possibly......"`
`"He couldn't possibly do it?`
` He made this closed room himself...!!"`
`"We have set up...just one exit other than the door. `
`......That one's in the bathroom."`
`"My merciful master has arranged for a last way out if you fail to think of any trick to escape.`
` ......Please listen up!!"`
`Bernkastel guided Battler to the bathroom.`
` It was just a normal bathroom.`
` The setup that had surprised Erika to buy time was no longer working.`
` However, the bundle of wire and the nippers that had been used to prepare that trap...`
` still lay in the empty bathtub.`
`"Are you saying......that I can use these to escape......?"`
`"Yes, please feel free.`
` It's a present. `
`......However, no matter what you use, you can't lock the room from the outside.`
` And you can't fool the seals either, okay?`
` These tools aren't here to help you pull some trick with the chain lock.`
` ......They're here to let you escape from this room in a more direct way..."`
`"......H......how am I supposed to use these......?"`
`"............`
`......Not bad, Bern.`
` ......I see......that your mind's as grotesque as ever......"`
`"There is an exit that leads directly outside from this bathroom.`
` ......Can you find it?"`
`"......Y...you don't mean......"`
`"D, did you figure it out, Beato...?!`
` Please, tell me...!!"`
`"That's...`
`......i, `
`......impossible........."`
`"Please, where is it?! Tell me!!`
` We can't let the game end like this!!"`
`"There......"`
`"Huh? Where......?`
` Under...the bathtub......?"`
`"Can't you see it? There's a round hole that leads straight out of this room."`
`"......It's a bit small though......"`
`"Y, `
`......you...`
`...you...`
`......aahh...`
`...nngggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh......"`
`"It's the drain right there at the bottom of the bathtub.`
` You can get out of there without touching the chain lock.`
` But your body is a bit too big to get through this exit.`
` That's why I decided to lend you those tools there."`
`You can escape......through the drain...? `
`How...? `
`She couldn't mean using those nippers for a hundred years to widen that hole, right...? `
`Battler and Beato......had already realized.`
`...They had figured out this demonic way out that the demons were proposing......`
`"Just use those nippers...`
`...and cut your body into pieces that can fit."`
`"......*crunch*crunch*.`
` ......Might as well sit back in the tub under a hot shower...`
` as you start from your feet going up...chip then wash, chip then wash... `
`Just keep doing that and, oh, what do you know,`
` you've suddenly managed to escape from the closed room."`
`"'Oh, what do you know' is right, my master...!`
` Looks like both siblings are gonna end up the same way...!`
` Heheh......heheheheheheheheheeheheheh!!"`
`"But Bern...?`
` At that rate, just the hand holding the nippers will be left."`
`"That's why we have the wire...`
` ...Beforehand, Battler will have to wrap the wire around his wrist, then stretch the other end out into the corridor through the crack in the door.`
` ......You should be able to fit just a wrist through the crack left by the chain lock."`
`"......If you're willing to do that, I'd be happy to pull that wire from the hallway and save you."`
`"My master, if you do that, I want it!!`
` Battler's wrist...`
` eheheheheheheheheeheheheheheheh!!"`
`"And what would you use that for...?`
` But no, I've already decided to use it as a back scratcher.`
` When the time comes, I'll scratch your back with it. What do you say?"`
`"Y, yeees, my master...`
`...Master's going to scratch my back...`
` with Battler's handhahahaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"........Finding them annoying?`
` Irritating? Obnoxious? `
`......Don't worry, it'll get quiet really soon.`
` ......All noise to disturb your thoughts...`
`......will now disappear for all eternity, until you can escape from this room."`
`"Th, ...that's a relief...`
` I'll be glad of the quiet...!"`
`"............Here's......some advice from a survivor of hell.`
` ......Enjoy this noise while you can.`
` .........Even the annoying insults you hear now...`
`...will bring you fond memories to preserve your sanity while amidst the eternal silence."`
`.........Do you hate Bern and Erika? `
`Then that's their parting gift to you.`
`......As long as you have hatred, you will be able to avoid giving up.`
` Giving up has a completely different meaning here, okay...?`
`......Prepare yourself while you can...`
` for the eternity of the hell you'll be in when you've given up...but still cannot escape.`
`"Did you just call yourself a survivor......? `
`......Then, `
`......you also......"`
`"......You know, ............every once in a while,`
` ...that terror comes back to me.`
` .........I wonder......whether I really have escaped from that hell.`
` .........What if......I actually lost my mind a long time ago...`
`...and I'm still in there...`
` just seeing a delusion of us all chatting happily like this...?`
` ......That nightmare still terrifies me...`
` ......And so, I need to constantly feel...truly feel that this isn't a dream...`
` ......Hey, ...are you guys...really...real...?`
` ...You aren't just an insane delusion I'm having inside that hell, ...right...? Right? ......Right......?"`
`There was something in Lambdadelta's pleading expression that sent shivers down the spine.`
` It was probably more terrifying than any threatening words she could have used with even the most vile expression on her face......`
` It's time for Battler to realize.`
`......A logic error isn't so sympathetic that you can just stick out your tongue, `
`ask for forgiveness, and say you'll be more careful next time......`
` It is never worth risking one by leaving things up to chance, even if you feel that you can't back down at this point in the fight......`
` It's time for him to pay up and understand the true risk and terror implied by the words 'betting one's life on a fight', `
`which must sound so exciting for a man......`
`"Battler-san, get ahold of yourself...!`
` I'll think deeply upon it as well!`
` I'll think of a trick to escape this room with all I've got...!`
` I will come to save you...!!"`
`"B......Beato...`
` ...Uuu...uuuwwaaaaaaaaaahhhh......`
` I'll definitely think of something...just waaaaaaaaaatch......"`
`"Well, regretfully, it's time for us to leave. `
`We mustn't get in the way of his job any longer."`
`"See you later,`
` Battler-san. `
`......Or, like you'd say it, <see you again>, right?`
` <Have a nice day>...`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`".........Later, `
`......Battler.`
` ......Good luck."`
`"Battler-san, don't give up...! `
`You will certainly think of a trick!`
` I'll think as well, and I'll come to save you!!"`
`"B, ......Beato.........?!"`
`Before he could finish saying Beato's name, ......they had all disappeared.`
`......They hadn't disappeared in a golden spray, or turned into butterflies and flown away...`
` Just as though there had never been anyone in this room `
`since the beginning, `
`.........everyone but him had vanished in an instant.`
` Nothing remained...`
`...not their voices, their presence, their warmth,`
` ......nor even the faint perfume Beato had worn.`
` The frigid air of the room was wrapped only in the lonely sound of the wind and rain......`
` With that overpowering feeling of isolation......`
` I finally began to realize......how horrible a punishment this would be......`
`"D, ......damn those bastards...`
` ......It can't be that hard to get out of a room like this...... `
`I mean, rooms are made so that people can come in and out of them, right...?`
` ......If they can't do that, you wouldn't call it a room."`
`How pointless...`
` ......It's easy to undo the lock and chain from the inside.`
`......Dammit...`
` For some reason, I've always been clumsy...`
`...and undoing chain locks always gives me trouble.`
` Oh, ......it's off.`
` Heheh, ......heh...how pointless.`
` Look, ......I can already open the door whenever I want...`
`......Hey...`
`...what's this cold feeling on my neck......? `
`What the hell is this.........?`
`......Why is there suddenly this iron collar around my neck......that's attached to a chain? `
`Dammit, who would do something like that...`
`......Wh, when I reset the chain lock, it disappears. `
`And when I take it off, it appears.`
` The chain is pretty long, so I can make it pretty far out into the hallway.`
` But it won't let go of the door...`
` Then if I close the door,`
` .........stand on the outside and stick my hand through the crack...`
`......maybe I can figure out how to set the chain......`
`.........Uuu......geh......`
` Why......have I always been so clumsy...`
` ......I'm not really clumsy......it's just that me and chain locks don't go well together...`
` Dammit, .....I hate this chain lock...I hate this chain...`
` Why......won't it work...?`
` Why......can't I set the chain lock from the outside......?`
` Dammit...dammit...dammit...`
`......Nng...`
` ggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!`
`"......Battler-san, `
`......Battler-san!! `
`Hang in there...hang in there...!!"`
`"............`
`......Can't......get out...`
`......ggh...kk......"`
`Beato called out to Battler repeatedly, shaking his shoulders hard, ......but by now, Battler's eyes were blank.`
`......The words didn't reach him......`
` Bernkastel and Erika had already left.`
` The game was officially suspended until Battler could think of a new trick,`
` ......but it was doubtful that it would be resumed even after a thousand years...or more...`
`"......Okay, I'm heading off too.`
` ......So long, you two."`
`"Th, there's no need to say 'so long'...!`
` We'll...we'll think of a trick right away, and the game will resume!`
` We won't take up your time...!`
` So stay here a little longer...! Please...!!"`
`"......We've heard those same words from many witches in the past.`
` ......And I've heard of hardly any who've actually managed to resume their games.`
` ......As far as I know, the only two are me......and Bern."`
`"Why......why would a person who knows about that hell throw another person into it?!`
` Just because you're bored?`
` Is that all?!"`
`"............Yeah, that's all.`
` ......It's to escape from boredom.`
` ......Because when we get bored, ......we remember.`
` We remember that hell.`
` ......And, you know, `
`......by throwing someone else down into that hell, `
`......we realize that, oh, we're the ones on the throwing side, `
`......and that means we aren't in that hell ourselves.`
` ......If we don't keep doing that, `
`.........then the fear of that hell will overwhelm us..."`
`"......If you two managed to get out of it, then he certainly will!`
` I will save him...!! I can say it with certainty......!!!"`
`"With 'certainty'......? `
`......You swear with certainty before me, `
`Lambdadelta, the Witch of Certainty...?"`
`"Yes, with certainty...!!"`
`"............`
`......Very well.`
` I was the guardian for the former you anyway. `
`......Though the current you is different,`
` ......I'll take care of you one last time.`
` ......I'll give you a parting gift."`
`"And what......is that...?"`
`"Hope.`
` .........As long as you hold on to your 'certainty', your wishes will definitely come true."`
`"............"`
`"Are you listening?`
` The old you was the Endless Witch Beatrice.`
` ......You used to love detective novels that depicted impossible crimes,`
` and you used those to make the claim that a witch existed, to make many people believe in magic...`
` as one stage on your path to becoming a witch."`
`"......Detective......novels..."`
`"Yep.`
` The old you was an avid reader. `
`......You loved detective novels, loved closed room murders......and were a super expert on impossible crimes.`
` You searched for and found several closed room tricks,`
` ......found the single most basic element to all of the tricks, and used that to form the core of your magical compendium."`
`"......Didn't Battler tell you?`
` ......He said that the old you would definitely have thought of a way out of this predicament. `
`.........I agree with that.`
` I guarantee it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, Lambdadelta.`
` ......The old you would definitely have cleared up this closed room trick......"`
`"............!"`
`"......That's my parting gift to you.`
` .........Goodbye.`
` You've sworn to the Witch of Certainty that you will act with certainty.`
` So I won't say farewell. `
`......'I'll see you again soon'."`
`"Y, ......yes.`
` ......We'll see you again...soon......!"`
`Lambdadelta vanished into thin air......`
` Then, in the smoking room of the witch...`
`...the two who had held the title of Endless Witch...were left behind.`
` One had empty eyes.`
` The other supported the first by his side.`
`......Ironically, ......it was the exact opposite...`
` of how their relationship had been in the previous game......`
