`......The eerie sound of the wind and rain.`
` Once again, I hazily regained consciousness on top of the bed...`
` The finger that the witch had bitten off..`
`...was still attached.`
` I didn't say 'it was all an illusion'...`
`...just that it was still attached.`
`...After all, the pain and the teeth marks as though a witch had bitten it...`
`......were still there.`
` And yet, the window, which I had supposedly smashed, had been fixed as though it had never been broken in the first place...`
`.........How can I escape this creepy room? `
`Why am I locked up in this eerie room......all alone...? `
`I want to get out.`
` ......I have to get out.`
` ......Let me out of here.........`
`......The door was sealed with a firm chain.`
` I could open it a crack, but only enough to peek out into the corridor at best.`
` It would probably be hard even to get just a fist through it.`
` The window won't budge either.`
` It was no better than a barred prison window...`
` The bathroom didn't even have a window.`
`......The only thing that could get out of there was the water that flowed out if you turned on the tap.`
`......No matter what I do, ......I can't think of a way out of here.`
` Being shut up in a place like this makes me a true prisoner.`
` Unless someone comes from outside to save me, ......I won't be able to get out for all eternity.`
`.........In that case, can't I just call for help? `
`Yes, the tiny gap I can make in that door must exist so that I can call for help.`
` But......can I make the words come out...? `
`Earlier, I tried to call out for help,`
` but for some reason, the words couldn't escape my mouth.`
`......I might have made some kind of mistake.`
` I might have just lost my voice in my haste and confusion.`
` I'll open the door and make that crack appear one more time.`
` The warm light of the hallway flowed in, making the darkness of the room stand out all the more...`
` Though I couldn't hear any voices, I did feel something peaceful.`
`......I'm sure everyone's in the room at the other end of the hallway, chatting happily about something.`
` If I can just call out, surely someone will come to save me......`
`".........Haah, .........haah, .........nng..."`
`Holding back some indescribable fear, I tried yelling once more...`
`"............!! `
`............!!! `
`...............!!!!"`
`But the result was the same.`
` It was like trying to yell underwater.`
` ......All I did was get out of breath, unable to call out in the slightest.`
`".........Haah!!`
` Haah, ......haah, .........haah........."`
`Even though I could say as much as I wanted if I just grumbled to myself inside the room,`
` ......whenever I tried to make my voice reach outside, I choked and was unable to say anything.`
` I understand.`
`......My body isn't the only thing locked up in this eerie closed room.`
`......My voice is too......`
` Thinking that I could use some other kind of sound to call for help, I tried opening and closing the door violently, making the chain rattle.`
` It does sound as though it's making a noisy clanking sound, ......but it's surely no good.`
` Even this sound......is being locked inside this closed room.`
` No matter how harsh a sound I make, ......I'm sure it'll be quieter than a leaf falling by the time it reaches the other end of the corridor......`
` I tried using the hateful chain that sealed the door to make a sound to call for someone,`
` but that only deepened my despair...`
`"............? `
`......This......chain......?"`
`That's insane...`
` Even though just a second ago, it was a stiff chain that looked like it was used to seal a monster away......`
` At some point, .........`
` it had transformed into a normal chain lock.`
` This changes everything.`
` Now I can just undo it from the inside...! `
`I tried to undo it, but the chain wasn't long enough for that while the door was still open a crack, and I couldn't get it off.`
` Of course.`
`"......C, calm down......`
`...............*gulp*..."`
`I gulped, ......and calmly closed the door.`
` Then, ......when I saw that the chain had slackened enough, ...I touched it with my finger to make sure.`
`......When I was little, ......I hated chains, because I could never get them undone right.`
` However, ......that was a long time ago.`
` Now, I can undo something like this.`
` ......Anyone could...it's easy...`
`*clank*......`
` I had a vision of the demon who had locked me in this room `
`using this as a trap to give me hope and then make me despair even more, `
`......but I pushed those thoughts aside for the time being.`
` I undid the chain lock...`
` and the chain dangled there right before my eyes.`
`......Now, `
`......there is no lock sealing this door.`
` Please, `
`......don't torment me anymore...`
`...and just...`
`......open normally......!`
`......Slowly......the door opened.`
` I had closed the door in order to undo the chain,`
` ......so the warm light from the hallway had been cut off.`
` If I open it again, what if that warm light is gone this time?`
` ......I was even afraid of that.`
` However, that was.........`
`......just me over-imagining things.`
` Slowly, `
`......quickly, `
`..no, I guess this is normal for a door......`
` As the door let out an annoying creak, `
`.........the exit from this cursed closed room finally opened......`
`"............!!`
` ...............!!!"`
`Ha...hahaha, I did it......I did it......! `
`Even my cry of joy was strangled.`
`......But that doesn't matter anymore.`
` All that matters is that I can get out! `
`I poked my head out and looked left and right down the corridor.`
` The warm corridor.`
` I could sense people having fun at the other end.`
` ......Everyone's right there.`
` Let's go, right now.`
`".........Gyeh.........?!?!"`
`At that moment, something cold and heartless crushed my throat.`
` It was as though an iron loop had been fastened around my neck and pulled on hard from behind.`
` No...not 'as though'.`
`......Without my knowing, `
`......at some point...`
`......a thick, metal collar had been fastened around my neck.`
` When did this happen?!`
` When I turned around, I despaired even more.`
` Out from the inner side of the door I had just opened, `
`......a thick chain had extended...`
`...and attached itself to my collar.`
` I pulled on it, but it didn't even budge.`
` When I shook it, the whole door creaked.`
`......What...`
`...th...`
`...the hell......`
` The chain that connected to my collar......was attached to the inner side of the door.`
` Yes.`
` The same vanishing chain that had secured the door a short while back...had suddenly become a chain holding me in place...`
` That's insane...that's insane...!! `
`Dammit, what's going on here?!! `
`I pulled with all my strength, trying to tear the whole door off,`
` but I already knew from repeated experiments that it wouldn't even budge.`
`......I'm sure this chain will disappear once I go back inside the room.`
` But it will never let me leave the room.`
` Though it had appeared to revert to being a normal chain lock, ......nothing had actually changed.`
` The fact was that 'the chain lock' still bound me to that room...`
`"......Uuu......nnngh......aaaaaaaaahhhh......!!!"`
`Tears flowing down my face, I pulled with all I had.`
`......It was completely useless.`
` No matter what I did, I'd never tear it loose.`
` And I wasn't even permitted to call out for help.`
`......I felt a confused anger at how the demon had mercilessly made me think that I'd escaped for just an instant.`
` But no matter how much I yelled, no voice came out, and no one on the other end of the corridor could hear me...`
` Then, `
`.........I noticed...`
`...an odd stain on the wall of the corridor.`
` It wasn't a stain.`
` ......They were letters, traced out by a finger that had been covered in red paint.`
`".........?!`
` ............?!?!"`
`Those letters......which looked like they had been drawn in blood,`
` answered my biggest question...`
` The chain lock must be set.`
` You're allowed to unset it, but it must then be reset.`
` Unless it is set, this exit of yours will be unusable.`
` I instantly understood the meaning of that ominous message.`
` Then I tried it out, and understood completely.`
` When I returned to the room and reset the chain lock, ......the binding around my neck disappeared.`
` When I undid the chain lock again, ......that heavy feeling around my neck returned.`
` In other words, I cannot leave this room while the chain lock is still unset.`
` In that case, why don't I just set the chain while outside the room...?! `
`I undid the chain one more time.`
` The collar and chain appeared around my neck again.`
` I stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind me, leaving only the slightest of cracks.`
` I stuck my hand through that crack, grabbed the dangling chain, and tried to reset it somehow.`
`......D, ......dammit......`
`......Even though it was so easy to do from the inside...`
`......why...`
` is it so hard to do from the outside...? `
`The gap needed to be wide if I wanted to manipulate the chain well.`
` However, that made the chain too short to reach.`
` To make the chain reach just a bit further, I would have to close the door a little bit more.`
` But if I do that, there won't even be enough of a gap to fit my hand in.`
`......Of course, it was perfectly natural.`
` Chain locks are made to be done from the inside.`
` They'd be completely pointless if you could set and unset them from the outside.`
` That's why the length of the chain is specially chosen `
`to prevent anyone from setting or unsetting it from the outside.`
` Then can I use some kind of hard and thin tool? `
`If the gap of the door is just a finger's width across, that's more than enough for the chain to reach.`
`......If I could just bend a wire hanger so that it fits through the crack `
`and work the chain with that......`
` That's right, there's a closet just to the side of the door.`
` Could there be some hangers in there?`
`".........Found one...!!`
` O, ......ooh, thank god...!!"`
`A single, cheap-looking hanger, like one you might find in a laundry room, was hanging there.`
`......Really? `
`I'm pretty sure that when I last looked a short while ago...`
`...nothing like this was in the closet...`
` Ah, who cares...!`
` Quickly......quickly......!! `
`I twisted the wire hanger, bending the end with the tip around.`
` I formed a loop at the end to grab at things with,`
` ......making for a sort of burglar's tool.`
` I then dashed out into the corridor again and closed the door almost as far as it would go.`
` My wrist could never pass through this.`
` However, if I close it this much, the chain should have extra length to spare...! `
`And this crack is large enough for me to stick the hanger through...! `
`Now it's just a matter of technique...! `
`I'll definitely be able to do it if I try enough times...I'm certain of it!!`
`".........Hah......haah.........haah......haah...!"`
`It's harder than it looks...`
`.......But the chain is long enough.`
` ......It isn't impossible...! `
`I had finally gotten my hands on the one way to escape.`
`......It was hard, yes, but it was theoretically possible.`
` If it is possible, I'll be able to get out.`
` I'll be able to escape from here...!!`
`"......Hihi......hihihihihihihihihi......"`
`"......! ...?!?!"`
`At that moment, ......I felt a heavy weight on the far side of the door.`
` It felt as though someone inside the room had pressed their forehead against the door...`
` and was drawing closer.`
` And she...`
`......the witch...`
`......had laughed.`
` Then, I felt a powerful and strange force on the wire hanger.`
`......Is she trying to grab it away from me?! `
`Yeah right, like hell I'll let go!! `
`Like hell I'll let my one key out of here get stolen while my guard's down!! `
`Fortunately, I had stuck my wrist through it so that I wouldn't drop it if my hand got tired.`
` You won't be able to snatch this out of my hands...!`
`"Hihihi, hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi......"`
`The witch on the other side of the door watched me and laughed......`
` Then, ......I noticed something weird.`
` I looked at my left hand, which I had pressed against the door to hold it in place,`
` ......and between the fingers of that hand,`
` ......I could see something red.`
`.........They were...`
`......red...letters.`
` I realized immediately.`
` At some point in time, even more bloody letters had been drawn on the door,`
` and my left hand had been covering them up.`
` Still fighting against the vice-like strength of the witch beyond the door, ......I moved my left hand to the side.`
` Where that hand had been...`
`...bloody letters had indeed been drawn.`
` It was......as though someone had predicted that I'd struggle this way from the very beginning...`
`...a message from the witch to me.`
` It is impossible to set or unset the chain lock from the outside `
`by any means.`
` All tricks done from the corridor......had been sealed by the red letters.`
`"N, .........no way........."`
`"Hihihihihihihi. `
`......Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi...!!"`
`There was suddenly a terrible sound, and the force that had been pulling on the hanger was suddenly released.`
` Then, ....when I pulled it out and looked...I lost all hope.`
` As though it had been hit by the acid of the room's darkness, `
`......the tip of the hanger...`
`...had burnt and bubbled...`
`...and melted off.`
` Now it's pitifully short.`
` This can't be used for anything...! `
`It would be useless to search for a substitute.`
`......All schemes to close the chain from the outside...have been sealed...! `
`Dammit...`
`...dammit, dammit, dammit...!! `
`I threw the remnants of the wire hanger against the floor, `
`.......faced the hallway filled with a warm light, `
`......and called for help.`
` However, I just choked, unable to speak at all.`
` Everyone's just down the corridor.`
` And everything's peaceful there! `
`I can't hear their voices, but I know! `
`I'm sure they're all having a good time playing cards! `
`Please, someone notice!!`
` Someone...save me!!! `
`Hi...hihihihihihihi...`
`......hi `
`hi `
`hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`Aaaaaaaahgggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!!`
`"""......Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha."""`
`This time, it wasn't the witch's voice.`
` ......It was the happy voices of everyone else, which I could hear from the other end of the hallway...`
` Someone, come over here...`
`...and save meeeeeeeeeeeee......`
`"Sorry, but I'm out!"`
`George slammed his last card down, ending the game with his victory once again.`
` Everyone gasped in unison.`
` The cousins' room was filled with laughter as they enjoyed their card game...`
`"Whoooooooa, so you really did have it, George-aniki! `
`Damn you...damn you six of spaaaaadeeessss!"`
`"Your eight of diamonds was pretty nasty too.`
` Aah, I was so close, ahahahahaha!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` You're incredible, George onii-chan! You won again!!"`
`"Yep, looks like we've won again.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`Maria couldn't really hold her own in an all-out battle.`
` So, she had teamed up with George, which was why she was celebrating his victory.`
`"......Gah............`
`......Utter defeat."`
`Kanon winced and let his cards drop to the table.`
` The game of sevens that Kanon and the cousins had been playing had been a fierce battle.`
` Normally, they would take things easy since Maria was there, so this sort of game was rare.`
` Kanon had started taking the game seriously, unwilling to lose,`
` so George and Battler had responded and the battle had grown fierce.`
` Unlike Battler, who was carefree enough to enjoy it whether he won or lost, Kanon's mood changed drastically with every victory and defeat.`
`......It was less of a dislike for losing and more that he just wasn't used to playing.`
` He wasn't used to trading a few wins and losses with his opponents,`
` so he took even losses within a game seriously.`
` Since he had resolved to win and had unfortunately challenged the veteran players George and Battler,`
` the result was plain to see.`
` As Kanon slumped his shoulders, Jessica slapped him on the back.`
`"Hey, you almost had it...!`
` Ahaha, I love `
`fighting all-out like this!"`
`"......Whether we went all-out or not, if we just lose in the end, it's all pointless..."`
`"Are you kidding me?`
` If you really gave it your all, who cares if you lose? `
`If you lost after hardly trying, then you'd be grumbling and complaining about how you'd have won if you'd taken it seriously, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` People who really give it their all never complain. `
`Those guys are always cheery no matter what the result."`
`"That's right.`
` And those people are scarier than anyone else.`
` They always learn something from their experience and grow."`
`"......Very true.`
` ...I was a coward, so I could never learn anything.`
` ...I see that I am still immature."`
`I am furniture, so it is useless to dream.`
` Because he had rigidly believed that, he had distanced himself from everything and shut himself away.`
` However, during that time, Shannon had undergone many life adventures.`
` And now, her hand is resting on the door separating furniture and humans......`
` The old Kanon would only have seen this card game as a way to pass the time.`
` However, ......the new Kanon was now capable of gaining something new from this experience.`
` That could probably be called...growth.`
` When time passes, furniture does nothing but rot.`
` Being able to grow......is a privilege given only to humans.`
`"Thanks for playing with us.`
` You probably have work to do, like filling in the log, right...? `
`I'm really glad you decided to hang out with us."`
`"......Actually, `
`I had a lot of fun.`
` ......Not only that......I now understand why doing things like that is fun.`
` Thank you very much for forcing me to come."`
`"Let's challenge ourselves more and more.`
` And let's go and find more and more things you didn't know about. `
`......O, `
`oh, `
`by the way, `
`about what we were talking about...`
` ever wanted to try playing guitar?`
` W, well, it's not like I'll force you to or anything, but..."`
`".........It must be very difficult."`
`"Y, yeah, I guess.`
` But I'll do a good job teaching you, and I'll even practice with you.`
` Well, I guess I'm not that much of an expert myself, hahaha..."`
`At first, Kanon was scared that he might make a complete fool of himself if he touched a musical instrument for the first time in his life.`
`......It was because he knew that screwing up like that would make him feel bad.`
`......However, Kanon was starting to learn.`
`"It's only natural that I'll be bad when I first start.`
` ......If I just try to run away from that, I'll never learn a thing for all eternity.`
` I'll never achieve anything."`
`"Yep.`
` Isn't that why people love it when they feel themselves improving?`
` Even I sucked at making my left and right hands move at the same time when I first started...!`
` But I slowly got the knack of it, and it started to feel more and more natural...!"`
`"..................`
`......I'd like to reach that level too.`
` If one path to that goal is playing music with you, Milady, ......I would love to do that with you."`
`"R, really...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'm sure I'll be horrible when I start, and I might even make you lose hope in me at times. `
`......But if I've given it my all, even messing up is no big deal.`
` ......That's what I learned from you all just now."`
`"......Hahahahahahaha,`
` you're embarrassing me..."`
`"Now, .........I like you even more, Milady.`
` Because I averted my eyes for so long, even though you shone like the sun,`
` I never noticed you when you were right there next to me..."`
`"Eheheheh.`
` Then I'd better work even harder to make you like me even more...`
` Ehehihi, hahyahyahya..."`
`Kanon's serious and competitive words were more than enough to make Jessica shy.`
` However, Kanon's expression unexpectedly clouded......`
`"......Milady, the reason I like you is so clear.`
` ......Because of that, I can't bear not knowing."`
`"N, not knowing what......?"`
`"......Why did you start to like me?`
` .........Unlike you, I do not shine in any sense.`
` ......Even now, I'm just clinging to your back as you shine the way.`
` ......I can't think of any reason why you would like a wretch like me."`
`"Th, ......that's not true, okay?!`
` There are all kinds of good things about you, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......Let me swallow my pride and ask.`
` ......What about me made you like me, Milady?"`
`Kanon hung his head.`
`......He had never learned anything, so he had never been able to take the lead with her.`
` And yet, it made him sad and frustrated that he had always been the one-sided recipient of her affection......`
` and could do nothing but respond to it.`
` Jessica was lost for words.`
`......After all, compared to the reason that Kanon had started to like Jessica,`
` .........Jessica's reason was a lot more vague.`
` She had heard Shannon talking about her love with George,`
` ......and at school, she and her friends had always talked about relationships with boys.`
` There would have been nothing strange about a girl fascinated by the idea of romance developing an interest in a nearby member of the opposite sex.`
`......However, if you put that into words,`
` it would be misinterpreted to mean that any nearby boy would have done just as well......`
` However, ......at this moment, her heart was filled with nothing besides her own feelings.`
` She really did like Kanon, ......and she truly wanted to fall in love.`
` As a result, they might end up together, or they might not.`
` However, if she reached that result without holding back, she could accept it no matter which it was.`
` That's why she was able to become serious about her emotions.`
` However, ......she couldn't find the right words to tell Kanon this.`
` When Kanon saw Jessica bite her lower lip in frustration, `
`.........he finally realized...`
`"......I'm such a fool."`
`"Huh?"`
`"What about me do you like?`
` ......That very question is foolish. `
`It's proof that I'm not serious about myself, and that I haven't been able to understand myself.`
` ......It's horrible of me to try and make you say it for me."`
`"Th, that's not true...!`
` A, after all, it's the first question any girl would like to ask after being given a love confession...! `
`Th, the question 'What part of me do you like?'..."`
`"It was immature of me to ask you that.`
` How could anyone like someone so immature?"`
`"W, wait, that's not..."`
`Jessica panicked, trying desperately to explain how she felt.`
` However, Kanon was calm.`
` And then, he spoke.`
`"In that case,`
` .........I want you to like me...`
` the way I already like you.`
` ......I've decided to change myself so that can happen. `
`I can hardly imagine that you would like me the way I am.`
` ......But someday.........no matter what..."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I'm absolutely sure you'll become a wonderful person, Kanon-kun.`
` A guy so cool that I can't keep my eyes off you. `
`Until then, I'll stick by you all the way.`
` ......We have plenty of time...!"`
`"..................`
`......But unfortunately, there isn't that much time left."`
`"......What about time?"`
`"When I talk about furniture......it usually saddens you.`
` ......However, this is something I must talk to you about.`
` And it is also something I must fight for with all my soul."`
`"What are you talking about...?`
` I don't want to hear any more of that 'I'm furniture so I can't fall in love' talk.`
` You're a human, not furniture...!"`
`"Yes.`
` I would like to become human. `
`However, I am still furniture."`
`"In that case, just do it...!"`
`"The witch taught me once.`
` ......The single element of this world.`
` She said it was love.`
` ......It's something that humans born into this world can take for granted. `
`......However, it is not something that those not from this world, who were born as furniture, can take for granted.`
` ......In order to gain it for themselves, they must have magic or a miracle."`
`......In the same way that Nee-san and George-sama...`
`...would never have ended up as they have without borrowing the power of that golden butterfly brooch.`
`"I don't really get this last part."`
`"......What don't you understand?`
` ......Let me hear it."`
`"Since this game began, ......a large portion of the time has been spent on Shannon and Kanon's determination to fall in love.`
` ......I have no problem with interpreting that as a story of growth and teenage determination for a girl and boy who call themselves furniture. `
`However, one of the assumptions they make feels really out of place to me."`
`".........Why is magic necessary?`
` ......Is that it...?"`
`"Both Shannon and Kanon......call themselves furniture.`
` ......These furniture have always claimed that there cannot be love between furniture and humans. `
`At that point, the magic of the golden butterfly brooch comes into play, and as the miraculous result of that magic, love is established between Shannon and George onii-chan.`
` That's what they claim."`
`"Could it not be merely that forbidden love between people of different classes `
`would be impossible to manage without a miracle of magic......?"`
`"Good point.`
` I can accept that Shannon and Kanon, who are servants in forbidden love with members of the family and suffering for it, `
`might debase themselves as furniture."`
`"......Then what is it that you cannot accept...?"`
`"'Without the power of magic once more, marriage will be impossible'.`
` ......That seems to be common knowledge between Shannon and Kanon.`
` ......I just can't understand that part."`
`After meeting in secret for quite some time, George and Shannon had finally gotten engaged.`
` Both were fully prepared for it emotionally,`
` and though there would be some trouble with the relatives, it would probably be impossible for anyone to prevent their marriage by this point.`
`".........Trying to stand between two who wish to be wed is as foolish as standing in front of an arrow and trying to catch it."`
`"Exactly.`
` Now that George onii-chan has sworn to protect his lover for the rest of their lives, he has no need to fear opposition and disinheritance from his parents.`
` ......On the contrary, you might even consider that a perfect test for his love for her. `
`.........In other words, they will be married no matter what.`
` No one can stop them.`
` And they have both consented to the engagement."`
`"No one can stop them or impede them.`
` Trying to break apart lovers is a foolhardy venture..."`
`"Yeah.`
` And that's what's strange.`
` There's no need for magic."`
`If George and Shannon `
`had wanted Eva's approval for their engagement...`
`......Then magic might really have been necessary.`
` After all, Eva had forbidden his relationship with her.`
` No matter how much George spoke on Shannon's behalf, the chances of Eva being convinced were very near zero.`
` If that were the case, it would be understandable if they wanted a magical miracle to make Eva acknowledge that engagement.`
`"However, George onii-chan has already sworn to it.`
` He doesn't care whether his parents approve of the engagement or not. `
`......Yeah.`
` There's nothing standing in the way of their engagement.`
` And Shannon should know that well herself.`
` So why is it that now, on this night where the proposal went so smoothly, she's still praying on a miracle of magic?"`
`"......The furniture claim that `
`she will not even have the right to marry without that miracle..."`
`"And there you go.`
` It means that Shannon has accepted George's proposal,`
` ......but she knows that there's still some kind of barrier that can't be overcome without a magical miracle.`
` And that barrier isn't something that they can overcome by their own efforts.`
` That's why they need this miracle called magic."`
`"Why do they need magic?`
` If two people love each other, what other miracle could they possibly need to be together?!"`
`".........Hmm, I see..."`
`Featherine listened to Ange's interpretation, smiling in a satisfied way.`
`......Apparently, she had already reached that conclusion and enjoyed watching Ange finally manage to do the same.`
`"And that same question applies to Kanon as well.`
` ......The love between him and Jessica onee-chan has just begun, but their emotions are pure.`
` There's nothing standing in their way.`
` They're already in a loving relationship even without the golden butterfly brooch.`
` ......It'd be no surprise if the relationship they've started lasts for years and eventually results in marriage.`
` There's nothing standing in their way either."`
`"......As long as they don't seek approval from Krauss and Natsuhi, it seems that they will not need a magical miracle either..."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Kanon watched how Shannon lived, and changed his own way of life.`
` Then, he let his true feelings be known and started a relationship with Jessica onee-chan.`
` ......There's no need for magic anymore."`
`"......If it were a one-sided love, then he might need a love charm or something.`
` But their feelings are already mutual.`
` They've already communicated their intentions to one another.`
` ......So why do they still need a miracle?"`
`Both furniture were in relationships of mutual love.`
` There shouldn't have been any need for a miracle any longer.`
` So why...`
`...do they still desire some miracle? `
`And on top of that, the single brooch was portrayed as bestowing only a single miracle.`
` It felt almost as though Shannon was hesitating because, if she used up that miracle for herself,`
` Kanon's chances at love would be automatically sealed away for eternity...`
`"So this is the question:`
` why is furniture not allowed to love?"`
`"......So, you ask why love is not permitted without the miracle known as magic."`
`"And also,`
` ......there's this golden butterfly brooch that's supposed to give the lamenting furniture the love they so strongly desire.`
` Just what on Earth is that?"`
`"Of course, it is a crystallization of magic.`
` However, like most magics, it can be burnt by the anti-magic toxin."`
`"......So, it can only have an effect for those who believe in magic and witches."`
`"Correct.`
` So, Shannon, who was capable of interacting with me, was able to make use of its benefits.`
` However, if Shannon had dropped it in a sandy beach and someone who knew nothing picked it up..."`
`"......If that person was shrouded in the anti-magic toxin, they wouldn't be able to make use of the brooch's magic power..."`
`"Precisely.`
` A witch's magical items often lose their power if they are not handed over directly. `
`However, just as how a witch can manifest herself if her existence is acknowledged by a great many humans and the anti-magic toxin disappears,`
` the power of that magical item can also be preserved if it is believed in by a great many people."`
`"That's ironic.`
` ......No matter what kind of magic we witches give out, everything depends on whether the human we give it to can accept it."`
`"I have heard that the same goes for medicine.`
` Even with the exact same medicine, humans who know of the medicine's effect experience it to a greater degree."`
`"......Oh, I think I understand.`
` When taking cold medicine, I've gotten the feeling that it's more effective when you read the description on the bottle."`
`As she listened, Beato thought that magic sounded a bit like a charm.`
` When most humans think of magic,`
` they think of incredible miracles being performed one after another in front of a crowd.`
` However, this true magic that the older sister spoke of sounded almost like a charm, `
`something that had no effect if the person using it didn't believe.`
`......Shannon's heart was captured by George bit by bit as he grew by leaps and bounds.`
` However, she had given up, thinking that one of a different class such as herself would never find love with him.`
` That was when Beatrice had given her the golden butterfly brooch and encouraged her.`
` Giving up means that you have zero chance of success.`
` However, with the power of magic, if you think that there just might be some chance of your wish coming true,`
` the odds of it happening are greater than zero, at the very least.`
` Zero remains zero forever, but if even a faint probability exists, ......it would be no exaggeration to say that a miracle had occurred since the time that probability had been zero.`
` Humans can use magic to take 'resignation', `
`by which they themselves make the probability of success zero, and cancel it out.`
` When a human does not give up, though their chances of success may be small, those chances do exist.`
` And the more determined they become, the greater those odds rise.`
` It was easy to imagine that Shannon had made earnest wishes upon the brooch, believed in its effect,`
` ......and tried little things over and over again to get George to like her.`
`"The power of belief becomes magic......"`
`"And those who make others believe are witches."`
`Those who make others believe...`
`...are witches.`
`......That's an interesting way to put it.`
` If you think about it, it's true.`
` Let's say a witch steps out into a spotlight, waves her staff in front of a crowd of onlookers,`
` and makes a rabbit appear out of thin air.`
` The many people who see it will surely think that it was a sleight of hand.`
` They might wonder at how it was accomplished, but they would be sure that it wasn't magic,`
` and they would applaud the splendid trick that had appeared to be magic.`
` But what if...`
` What if they performed a sacred ceremony inside a great ancient temple in front of a crowd of believers...`
` and ended up with the exact same result?`
`......Would any of the people there think that was a sleight of hand? `
`In fact, in the ancient past, when magic tricks as a form of entertainment didn't even exist and divine spirits were worshiped,`
` this would doubtlessly have been a miracle of magic...`
`"I, in that case,`
` ......could this here be...`
`...magic?"`
`"Oh?`
` Will the witch who cannot use magic now perform it for the first time?"`
`"H, ......here I have an empty tea cup.`
` There is nothing inside it."`
`"Yes, it is empty. `
`*giggle*, and then?"`
`"You take it, `
`......turn it like this, `
`......and place it upside down on the table."`
`"Heheheheheheh.`
` And then? What next?"`
`"Umm, `
`......l, let's both close our eyes and chant the incantation."`
`It was......the same magic that had been used to give Maria candies.`
` Beato the elder grinned and closed her eyes.`
` When she saw this, ......Beato slowly chanted the incantation.`
`"C, come, try to remember.`
` ......What was inside the cup?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Come, try to remember.`
` What was inside the cup?"`
`As she chanted, `
`Beato slowly opened her eyes and made sure that the older sister was repeating her with her eyes closed.`
` Then, a single gold butterfly appeared out of nowhere...`
`...fluttered down onto the overturned cup, and scattered away in a golden splash.`
`"May I open my eyes now?"`
`".........Y, yes.`
` Please open your eyes and inspect the contents of the cup."`
`"Well now.`
` ......Let us see how well your first bit of magic has worked."`
`Taking her time and dragging out the suspense a little, the older sister......lifted up the cup.`
`"......Aha."`
`"H, how is it......?"`
`When the cup was lifted up,`
` .........there lay...a single golden rose petal.`
`"C, ...could this be...magic...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......`
` Yes, it is. `
`{p:41:You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup. `
`It was a splendid bit of magic.}"`
`"'Without love, it cannot be seen'.`
` That much I understand."`
`"It may be viewed as a trick.`
` It may also be believed to be magic.`
` ......It all depends upon the toxin of the individual..."`
`"Then again, ......while this can explain some of the magic that's been used in the past, it can't explain everything."`
`"To get back to the point, all this stuff about believing in magic and charms...`
` It doesn't answer the question: 'What was this golden butterfly brooch, `
`which allowed the furniture, who strongly believed that they could not love, to finally find love?'"`
`"......If we blindly accept the story of those two Beatos as true,`
` ......might we assume that magic had the power to cancel out their 'resignation'?"`
`"'Why mustn't furniture fall in love?'`
` 'Why is the power of the magic brooch necessary?'`
` ......Yes, it does seem at a glance as though what you and the Beatos are saying provides an answer, though a vague one. `
`However, let me say this as a Reader.`
` ......I can't accept this as you've presented it."`
`"You cannot accept it, you say...?"`
`"......The tragedy those furniture were struggling to resist was something much more immense than this would allow for.`
` I doubt they could reform their way of thinking just because they were given a charm for making relationships."`
`"It's true that the brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to get together with George onii-chan, `
`but after that, she said she wanted to deepen their relationship without borrowing the power of magic, and she even tried to give the brooch back to Beato.`
` At that point, she supposedly rejected the miracle of magic for a time.`
` ......In that case, why is that power necessary again?"`
`"Well now.`
` ......Perhaps there is no way to say it except that love and marriage are very different things."`
`Featherine laughed lightly.`
`......She had probably formed a theory of her own and was laughing at Ange, who hadn't reached it yet.`
`"Let me hear it.`
` What's your view?"`
`"I'd like to keep that to myself for just a while longer.`
` ......And of course, watching you form doubts and let your mind race is one the joys of being read aloud to. `
`If I gave you my views, you would accept them and stop thinking.`
` Then, having you read aloud would be no fun."`
`"......So, you're having me read a mystery novel you already know the answer to, just so you can enjoy watching me blunder about."`
`"Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing.`
` ......If you wish to laugh at my bad taste, please do not hold back, my miko."`
`"'Wa ha ha ha.'"`
`"Pft, ......*giggle*giggle*, hahahahahahaha..."`
`I understand that a part of magic is created by a believing heart.`
` And that magic probably permeates deep into the world of us humans as well.`
` However, though it does permeate so far, the power that dwells within magic is small.`
` Visiting a shrine to pray for success on a test is something that many people do.`
` However, not many people will actually credit that visit as the reason for their success.`
` Praying like this contains no power except as a calming influence.`
` In love, where even a small chance and a little bit of courage can cause a major change,`
` this power might cause a massive upheaval...`
` However, .........would this insurmountable fate that the furniture claim to be in the middle of...`
` really change because of something like that......? `
`I think that in the past, the magical power of the brooch as it joined Shannon and George was little more than a good-luck charm.`
` However, at this point,`
` the magical power that the furniture are seeking from the brooch...`
`......It's not something as vague as a charm.`
` It feels much stronger, like a whole different interpretation of magic.`
` If you believe in a sleight of hand, it becomes magic.`
`......But that's no more than a child's trick.`
` And that only explains one part of magic.`
` They...are hoping for something.`
` They're hoping for something with much, much more power...`
`...for true magic, not a sleight of hand.`
`"......So then, `
`......just what kind of magic are the furniture expecting from that brooch......"`
`".........A golden butterfly...brooch...?"`
`"There exists a magic charm that the Golden Witch Beatrice gave to Shannon in exchange for smashing a mirror,`
` and which made her love succeed.`
` ......That's what this is."`
`From his pocket, ......`
` Kanon pulled a single wing from a gold butterfly.`
` Though it was a single wing, it was easy to tell from its shape that it had originally been part of something with a butterfly motif.`
`"The magic of this brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to start her relationship with George-sama.`
` ......However, before that magic was fully realized, she left it to me. `
`......So, thanks to the power of this brooch, `
`......I gained your affection, Milady."`
`"That's not true...`
` I started liking you because of my own honest feelings..."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...You are human, so you do not believe in witches or magic.`
` It's only natural. `
`......However, as furniture created by magic, `
`my very existence here is proof that the miracle of magic exists."`
`"S, sorry,`
` what are you talking about...?"`
`Jessica sort of grasped the gist of what Kanon was trying to say.`
` However, she couldn't understand it, and had to ask him to repeat it with a bitter smile...`
`"............`
`......Both Shannon and I.`
` ......We need magic to succeed in love.`
` The key for that is this brooch.`
` ......I stepped on it and crushed it, so we each have one part."`
`The brooch had lost its power when it was split in half.`
` However, if it was ever joined together again, ......its magic would be revived.`
` It would revive the miraculous power that could join furniture and a human together...`
`"However, a single brooch can only grant one person's wish.`
` ......Only one of us furniture can be joined by this single brooch."`
`It was the single live coal of love that the old, shrilly-laughing Beatrice had sown.`
` That Beatrice had likened humans who were tormented by this coal to ripe fruit and had enjoyed it evilly.`
` However, the magic infused within this seed...was real.`
` It was the only crystallization of magic that the Golden Witch Beatrice ever left in this world......`
` Its glint......increased.`
`"Huh? ......Wh, ...what the...?!"`
`"It's okay.`
` ......But please don't look right at it.`
` It'll blind you."`
`"Ah, .........aaaaahhh......!"`
`The glint grew even stronger, shining like the sun.`
` Jessica didn't need Kanon to tell her to put her hands over her eyes......`
` As the light grew stronger, ......a sound like the roar of the wind or the tide also grew in intensity.`
` The sound of the wind and rain outside had already been overwhelmed...`
` Jessica could no longer even stand, and she crouched on the floor......`
` A flood of sound and light...`
` Until it withdrew, Jessica could do nothing but moan......`
