`"..................zzzzz..."`
`"...............Whew.`
` ...Looks like she's finally calmed down..."`
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.`
`...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared that she had finally fallen asleep.`
` As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand.`
`...He had thought it might be alright to let go pretty soon, but he faithfully continued to hold her hand.`
` Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,`
` but even so, as promised, he didn't let go of her hand...`
` At that time, there was a heavy knock.`
` Eva had finally been able to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.`
`"......Aneki, Hideyoshi-san, sorry.`
` Is Rosa there...?"`
`It was Rudolf's voice.`
` ...What could it be? `
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva.`
`......It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.`
`"What is it?`
` Somethin' happen to Rosa?"`
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria-chan.`
` I thought they might be with you."`
`"...I heard her scolding Maria-chan in the corridor.`
` They got quiet after that, so I thought they had returned to the lobby, ......but did they...?"`
`".........That idiot..."`
`Rudolf clicked his tongue.`
` Other people could be seen in the corridor.`
` Rosa hadn't returned for a while after going out into the corridor, so they had begun to worry.`
` Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the removed chain.`
`"......The chain isn't set.`
` They must have gone outside to see the rose after all."`
`"Going out and leaving the door unlocked, that's just too careless.`
` What a troublesome person."`
`"...More importantly, now I'm worried about Rosa-san and Maria-chan themselves."`
`"Right.`
` ......Hey, brats.`
` Where was this rose of Maria's?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure..., it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."`
`"If those two are there, we should be able to tell quickly if we go."`
`"......Dad, shouldn't we bring them back as soon as we can...?"`
`"Of course.`
` We'll bring them back and spank them on the butt.`
` I'll dash out there and come back.`
` Lock the door as soon as I go out."`
`"...Dad, I'll go with you."`
`"Don't talk stupid.`
` It's obviously the brats' job to watch the house with Mama."`
`"............What is it...?`
` Did something happen......?"`
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...?`
` ...It seems that Rosa-san took Maria-chan outside.`
` ...How reckless of her."`
`"Rosa and Maria-chan are, `
`......outside...?`
` In the rose garden......?!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Oh, did you hear?`
` Maria-chan was causin' a ruckus because she wanted to see this rose."`
`"......Th, ......they mustn't, `
`......they mustn't go to the rose garden...!`
` Tell Rosa to stop...!"`
`"Th, there's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.`
` ......Seriously, how reckless of them."`
`".........That's not it...`
`...Not the rose garden...`
`...There's a witch there..., `
`......and she's waiting for a sacrifice...!`
` Rosa, you mustn't go..., `
`......ooooooooooohhh..."`
`...Eva cowered again, holding her head.`
`......Her complexion looked very bad.`
`"What is it?`
` Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?"`
`"............It's a dream, `
`......yes...`
`............In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa...... `
`.........That's right.`
` ...It's a dream, `
`......yes..."`
`"Calm down.`
` I'm also in this room.`
` The chain is also set.`
` The shutter is closed on the window, and there's even a gun.`
` This room is just like a fort.`
` There's no-thin' to be afraid of."`
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change.`
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying `
`that the grotesque nightmare she had just had was only a dream...`
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf confirmed the corpses of Rosa and Maria.`
` After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse.`
` If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.`
` It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands.`
` However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."`
`"......I will say it in red. `
`{p:1:Rosa and Maria died}. `
`{p:1:The cause of death was as Nanjo diagnosed}. `
`......She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.`
` Don't worry."`
`".........So you argue that even though you toyed with their death so much, it's all okay because the corpse is clean...`
` I definitely won't forgive you.`
`...I definitely won't forget all of that brutal treatment you gave Rosa oba-san,`
` so I won't forgive you..."`
`"...L, like I said, that wasn't me......`
`...I think I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."`
`"Shut the hell up.`
` I don't want to listen to you.`
`.........It was stated that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,`
` there are 10 people to press as suspects.`
` One of them probably killed those two.`
`...Or could it also be an accidental death?`
` Like Maria was having a tantrum,`
` and when Rosa oba-san tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.`
` Then she was so upset that she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died.`
`......How's that?`
` That way there's no need for a witch or magic."`
`"......Well, that's not true.`
` Actually, Rosa and Maria..."`
`"Shut up.`
` Didn't I say that I didn't want to listen to you?`
` You're an eyesore, so disappear.`
` You monster."`
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.`
`...Beato had also felt something out of place since the beginning.`
` In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.`
` However, he wouldn't even step into the ring.`
` She could feel that coldness.`
` Beato didn't find that interesting.`
`...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.`
` Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,`
` she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't fight.`
`"............`
`............Is that so?`
` Then I will hide myself.`
` ...Ronove, continue for me."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler-sama?"`
`".........There are no problems with that proposal.`
` If Battler-kun says that he doesn't want to see Beato's face, that is alright."`
`"Do what you like.`
` ...If I can live without seeing that monstrous face, I don't care about anything else."`
`"......Hey, wait a second.`
` ...You keep saying monster, monster, but isn't that a mean way to speak of me? `
`......Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?`
` Even though none of that was me, even though it was all the work of my disciple..."`
`".........It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now.`
` It's from the very beginning."`
`"Hey, Battleer.`
` Don't misunderstand, alright...?`
` Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?`
` ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but..."`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.`
` ......No matter what happens, I won't forgive how senselessly cruel you are."`
`"That's because a serial murder is part of the game...`
` It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."`
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened.`
` The last time, and the time before that too.`
` ......Tearing everyone's stomachs and stuffing them with sweets, plowing their faces,`
` what was the point of all that?"`
`"............That's, `
`...well..."`
`"All this stuff about closed room murders and tricks and alibis,`
` I'm willing to give you a pass on all that.`
` You want to claim that this is a murder done by magic,`
` so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes have to occur.`
`......But what exactly are all those grotesque murders supposed to mean?"`
`"............Well, umm, `
`............nothing much..."`
`"That's right.`
` They don't mean anything.`
` You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.`
` That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic.`
` You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.`
` That's not because you're a witch, or anything like that.`
` There's just some things I cannot forgive as a human."`
`".........Wh, `
`......what do you mean, as a human...?"`
`"For example,`
` ......the six people of the first twilight for this game.`
` ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,`
` the other corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead.`
` ...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyways, as far as killing goes, that was permissibly better.`
` It was much better than the nonsensical grotesqueness and cruelty from the first twilight last time, or the time before that."`
`"And this time, there were six closed rooms tied together to make a closed room chain.`
` ......That was sort of interesting.`
` When we were going back and forth with each other that time, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun.`
`...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.`
` ...We were both frantically doing all we could."`
`"This may sound weird, but I've felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us. `
`...We exist in conflict, `
`but I faintly thought that we might not be completely unable to understand each other's existence.`
`.........But just now, that feeling has been blown away without a trace."`
`"Th, that's where you're misunderstanding...!`
` That wasn't me-"`
`"That's not it.`
` That's not what I'm talking about! `
`......You watched Rosa oba-san being killed horribly over and over, `
`and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."`
`......When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed.`
` When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time was nothing more than a little whim,`
` ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.`
` And that's not all, you were even genuinely enjoying a brutal death.`
` You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.`
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.`
` Your character lets you enjoy it.`
` You said that I'd probably think Rosa oba-san being brutally killed over and over was fun.`
` That wasn't sarcasm.`
` You enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart, wanted me to sympathize, and said that I'd probably think it was fun.`
`......In that instant, I was disappointed, and I realized the truth.`
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not.`
` ......I will not forgive that cruelty of yours.`
` And I can't understand it!`
` I can't forgive it, either!`
` Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.`
` I won't step down and accept my own defeat."`
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely not needed for that game.`
` So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent.`
` Ronove is a hundred times better.`
` He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do.`
` Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me.`
`......That's right, you have awful taste.`
` You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand.`
` That's unpleasant in an opponent.`
` So I don't want to see your face again."`
`As Battler went on and on by himself, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.`
` Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told,`
` and this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.`
` For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,`
` ......as though she didn't even know herself what attitude she should take.`
` In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses, `
`and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.`
`"..................`
`.........In that case, do as you like.`
` From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.`
` ......You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?"`
`"......For the time being.`
` But I definitely won't forgive all of your cruel actions up until now.`
` So I definitely won't accept you.`
` For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked.`
` And I definitely won't lose.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"............Beato.`
` No matter how many more excuses you give, his impression will not waver. `
`...I have something to talk about later.`
` Until then, stay back."`
`"...............H, ...hmm...`
`...Understood. `
`...Then I'll hide myself until you call..."`
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them, and hid herself.`
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.`
` He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up.`
`"......She's, `
`...an idiot."`
`".........That's true.`
` An idiot, and honest."`
`"That idiot watched Rosa oba-san be killed horribly with me,`
` and turned around with a huge smile on her face. `
`......She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.`
` ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion...`
` Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.`
` ......It would have been much better if she had said it with her normal bullying face...`
`...Damn it..."`
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.`
` ......In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly.`
` Madam and I are her attendants.`
` No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.`
` For Milady, this is also-"`
`"Don't screw with me.`
` I don't remember ever becoming her friend."`
`"......That is true.`
` My apologies."`
`"..................`
`......There is one thing I would like to thank you for.`
` ...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game."`
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.`
` Then as though hating himself, he chuckled.`
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed. `
`......Let's resume the game.`
` Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you."`
`"I wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."`
`"......I've already made my move.`
` If we suppose that Rosa oba-san is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.`
` ......I don't want to suspect Rosa oba-san, but I think I can withstand that premise if it will beat the hell out of Beato."`
`"I will deny it with red. `
`{p:1:Rosa and Maria were killed by other people}."`
`"Alright.`
` ...Why don't we start from there. `
`............Damn, I'm just not getting fired up."`
`Since Rosa and Maria had been killed, it had become clear that the culprit was still hiding somewhere,`
` trying to add even more murders to this chain.`
` As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's corpse for being reckless several times,`
` but Rosa would never respond to that again.`
` They had decided to place the two corpses in one of the guest rooms, and to seal it until the police arrived...`
` The second murder, ...no, the murder of the second twilight, had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.`
` Because it had blown away the optimism that some of them had held,`
` the thought that 'actually, a crime didn't occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants'.`
` Trying to distract themselves from the loss of the people they liked, `
`George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.`
`......And, they had distracted their hearts `
`by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,`
` and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.`
` When the next murder occurred, it destroyed that thought,`
` ......and they were once again struck by the fact that the person they liked had most definitely been killed...`
` The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them...`
` After that, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe and locked, just in case.`
` They made certain that shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they checked that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.`
` On top of that, they checked their weapons once again,`
` and made sure that each other's hearts were prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.`
` Furthermore, the gun Rosa had been holding had been left near the place she had been found.`
` Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap,`
` but when Hideyoshi skillfully used a fire iron to fire off a test shot, it was definitely able to discharge.`
` As a result, since all five shots that had been loaded had discharged without any problems,`
` they reloaded it with bullets and handed it over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi.`
` However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.`
` This short barrel Winchester could load five shots.`
` In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once.`
` And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.`
` This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...`
`"......When the first murder occurred,`
` I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act. `
`...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, `
`but if he had actually been an accomplice, `
`I thought that there was a chance that the deaths of all the servants could have been some massive, elaborate act by Father.`
`......After all, unless we assume that the closed room situation they were in was all a charade, it couldn't have been created in the first place."`
`"...We also, `
`......suspected that.`
` ...No, `
`...I still want to believe that's the case."`
`"............My apologies, ......but that is not so.`
` ...I am quite old.`
` There may be a chance that I made a misdiagnosis. `
`......However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."`
`"I get it! `
`Don't go out of your way to say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"......My apologies..."`
`They couldn't know about it,`
` but Beato had already proclaimed the deaths of the six,`
` ...no, this time the deaths of all victims so far, in red.`
` That faint dream that it was all a farce, and that the victims were actually alive,`
` ......it's a shame, but that's impossible...`
`"......In that case, it's more natural to think that there's someone hiding around who's acquainted with the mansion,`
` carrying out a well-polished crime.`
` In other words, from the time that the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there were more than 18 people on this island."`
`Of course, there was no way for them to know that.`
` That claim of Rudolf's had also been denied in red.`
` There are no more than 18 humans on this island...`
`"Maybe it's fairly consistent if you think of it that way.`
` ......In other words, this person who's hiding is actually someone who shouldn't be on this island right now.`
` And yet, there's the possibility that it was someone whose face was known by Rosa-san, and with whom she would let her guard down."`
`"......S, `
`so, for example, `
`could it be, a servant whose shift doesn't lie on these two days...?"`
`"Hmm......`
`...It's hard to argue with that one.`
` When they finished their service and left the island, it isn't as though we made sure by punching their ticket or anything.`
` If we suppose that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island, and actually stayed here,`
` that would be hard to deny..."`
`"......I don't think Rosa-san is such a fool.`
` If a servant who was supposed to be dead popped up in front of you, any normal person'd be at their most cautious..."`
`"............I have a problem with even labeling this as a crime by an acquaintance.`
` ...They suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness, and were about to steal her gun.`
` Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.`
` The guesthouse was nearby, so they wanted to avoid the sound of a gunshot, and they killed Maria-chan with their bare hands..., perhaps."`
`"......There's also that possibility.`
` ...Still, even if that is the case. `
`Would they intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime?`
` We don't know what the culprit is armed with, but they must feel an element of uncertainty about our guns.`
` ...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?`
` Why would they intentionally leave it at the scene of the crime?"`
`"At first, I thought that gun was a trap.`
` ......That's what chessboard thinking says it would be.`
` By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.`
` And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.`
` ...I was sure that it would have some dangerous device to make it explode and cause massive injuries."`
`"But, it's actually alright. `
`......The culprit was probably in a hurry.`
` I'll bet that right now, they're regretting that they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"`
`".........I don't like it.`
` It ticks me off, 'cause it's like a message from the witch, saying that she isn't even scared of guns."`
`"...However, in any event, this is a fearsome opponent.`
` Even from the outside, they should have realized that Rosa was holding a gun. `
`To think that they attacked her despite that.`
` ......We should not neglect the fact that they are unafraid of guns."`
`"Hmm...`
` It's as Natsuhi says.`
` ......We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."`
`"This is just for peace of mind, but... `
`.........at the time we think Rosa-san was attacked outside,`
` where was everyone...?"`
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie-san.`
` I can guarantee their alibis."`
`"Eva and I were together.`
` I can guarantee that."`
`"George-aniki, Jessica, and I were together.`
` ......When Rosa oba-san yelled at us to return to the second floor, `
`we retraced our steps back to the cousins' room, all dejected."`
`"......That time, `
`...if we hadn't let Maria go..."`
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..."`
`"............Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I, I was reading a book in a room on the second floor. `
`......I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi, `
`but I believe everyone saw me return to the second floor with the children."`
`"...Once I say this, it'll never end, `
`but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,`
` then climbed back up using the rain gutter or something...?"`
`"D, d, don't be absurd...`
` How could I perform a feat such as jumping down from the second story or climbing up with this old body..."`
`"......Let us stop...`
` suspecting each other...`
` It's more important that we trust each other, and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."`
`"You're right...`
`...It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` .........For now, let's stop doubting each other."`
`"That's right.`
` We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned. `
`......We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.`
` Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."`
`".........What is it, Eva?`
` ...Is your body still feelin' bad...?"`
`"M, Mother, what's wrong?`
` Are you alright...?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...It looks like my fever is still strong.`
` I'll be fine, so leave me alone..."`
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.`
`...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation, `
`but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all...`
`"Yeah.`
` I killed those two.`
` Now, the only ones who know about the gold are us.`
` I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings."`
`"............What have you......!`
` There was so much of that gold, right?!`
` Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all, right...?!"`
`"It would.`
` ...That gold is to be passed on only to the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` That is because the whole of it is itself the honor of the head.`
`......To injure that even a tiny bit,`
` will definitely not be permitted by me, the new Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...?`
` Do you actually plan to become a murderer for five more people...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` If I don't finish that annoying ceremony, it seems that my power as a witch won't become complete.`
`......Hey, 'me'. `
`...The power of the witch is really awesome.`
` It really can make all of our delusions become reality.`
` The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!`
` Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.`
` If I can complete the ceremony and make my power complete, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Stop acting like an idiot...!`
` Haven't you played witch enough?`
` We found the gold.`
` And we've even been promised the position of the next family head.`
` We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but by now, that's a dream that will definitely come true.`
` ......Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"`
`"I wanted to become a witch."`
`"I don't know anything about that dream...!"`
`"That's it.`
` Because I kept holding on to that dream, I've lived at this age forever.`
` ......When you became an adult, you threw that dream away.`
`......No matter how long you wait, the rabbit holding a clock won't visit you,`
` and you won't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.`
` Of course, you definitely won't be invited to the land of cards.`
` Because you gave up like that, you became an adult.`
` So you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.`
` ...You've even forgotten that it truly was your own dream at one point."`
`"......Anyways, stop it!`
` I've already gotten my hands on two dreams!`
` The gold and the position of head.`
` That's more than enough!`
` So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!`
` Be obedient...!!"`
`".........No wa-y.`
` Magic's too interesting. `
`......Also, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.`
` It's not fair if my dream doesn't come true too."`
`"I am grateful for your magic, and I accept that you are a real witch.`
` ......So from now on, be obedient and return to the inside of my heart!`
` And never appear again!!"`
`"No wa-y.`
` ......We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we?`
` That's right, I am not you anymore.`
` You are Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I am the Golden Witch Beatrice. `
`So it's not my responsibility to go back to the inside of your heart.`
` ......I guess I feel like a butterfly who has broken out of her cocoon, which is you."`
`"............Haah, `
`......haah......`
`...urg, `
`......the fever, `
`...is making my mind cloudy......"`
`"My inexperience with my magic power is making me support it with your vitality.`
` Until I finish the ceremony and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.`
` I'll take that in exchange for making two of your dreams come true.`
`......It's alright, don't worry, okay?`
` For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family.`
` Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi. `
`...After that, what about that old geezer Nanjo?`
` Perfect, I'll kill those five people.`
` *giggle*giggle*, could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Eva finally crouched down.`
` Hideyoshi rushed up to her, and lent her his shoulder...`
`"......Are you alright?`
` ...Let's take it easy and rest!"`
`"Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"`
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I'm taking medicine.`
` ......I apologize for saying this in such an extreme situation, `
`...but let me rest a little longer..."`
`"Mom..., I'll lend a hand too..."`
`"Thank you,`
` but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me.`
` ......Go back to the second story cousins' room, and don't come out no matter what.`
` ...Understood...?`
` No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse......`
`...Outside, `
`......that, witch is......, `
`uuuu..."`
`"Don't talk anymore...! `
`Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watching over Eva in the room.`
` Call if something happens."`
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.`
`...However, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling good.`
` They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night, and had been pressed by tension since that morning.`
`...They were mustering their energy to protect the family,`
` but if they relaxed even a little, surely everyone would be down and out...`
`"......Everything has gone as planned until now, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"`
`"Difficult, you say...?"`
`"Hmm.`
` In the average situation, as the ceremony progresses and the victims increase, they begin to tighten their guard,`
` and in most cases, they hold up in one place and stop moving.`
` That is extremely inconvenient for us."`
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of humans in a group...?"`
`"Witches are not inferior to humans...`
` However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that humans have gotten their hands on a poison...`
`......This wasn't a problem long ago, during the period that witches were believed in,`
` but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era fundamentally deny magic.`
` In other words, their existence itself is anti-magical.`
` As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."`
`"In other words, you're saying that the more humans there are, `
`the stronger that magic-resisting toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"`
`"......The combined amount of power in their hearts that denies magic, in other words, their magic resistance power, becomes the denominator in the power of the magic...`
` Understand?`
` Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` Actually, I understand it easily.`
` ...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are that don't believe in magic,`
` and the stronger their will is, the greater the dramatic division in the effect of the magic is.`
` ......I see, if it's so formulaic, I'll have to rethink my method of attack."`
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.`
` It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens, divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either.`
` However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.`
` And that toxin started piling up in humans since the time they forgot to respect things sacred,`
` ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.`
` Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.`
`...They had been forced to choose whether to throw away their magic and live as humans, or live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of humans didn't reach.`
` In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only a few dozen humans, was extremely favorable for witches.`
` And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story, about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.`
`...In other words, by permeating the island with the fear that a witch might exist,`
` the magic-resisting toxin from the humans was weakened.`
` A small population, and a margin which made it possible to accept a magical being.`
` In other words, minds that were only weakly anti-magical.`
`...Only in the valley where those two converged, could a witch live in modern times...`
`"I see...`
`......So by this formula, we can make several rules about how a witch can use her power efficiently.`
` The first one is creating a scene.`
` Create a murder scene that you couldn't imagine was done by humans, decorate it with occult ornaments, `
`make it look very much like a witch exists, and by permeating the people with fear, make them believe that witches exist,`
` and as a result, the anti-magic power and the denominator for the power of the magic will be decreased.`
` ......I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"`
`"Th, that's right, exactly...!`
` The gaudy scenes for the first twilight each game are all for that reason. `
`It's definitely not as though I like cruel things or am doing it for fun..."`
`"...In that case, Predecessor-sama,`
` this time was a failure.`
` You killed them in a very plain way.`
` It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery.`
`.........I heard about last time and the time before that from Ronove.`
` You should have damaged the corpses more grotesquely, like you did then, making it look like a fantasy and instilling fear in those people."`
`".........W, ...well, about that.`
` ...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, see...?`
` Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!"`
`Actually, it really had been her whim.`
` After hearing that from Battler, she couldn't say it out loud anymore,`
` but she had decided her method of killing based only on a whim.`
` No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide? `
`Because she had left the closed room of this game's first twilight to him.`
` But if Beato had gotten a cruel idea, then she surely would have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than the last game...`
`".....................`
` For the methods of Rosa and Maria's deaths too, you told me to be prudent,`
` but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it? `
`In actuality, by now, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.`
` They're sure that it isn't a fantasy, but completely in the mystery genre.`
` This turn of events is a failure for us witches.`
` ......For some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor-sama."`
`"Aah..., l, like they say, things you learn when you're young will definitely help you out in the future...!`
` This is a test passed on from my predecessor to you.`
` Challenge it with respect.`
` Wahahaha...!"`
`Beato tried to laugh heartily,`
` but it was obviously a fake laugh trying to cover something up,`
` and the new witch shrugged, sighing.`
`".....................`
`...At this stage, it's probably too late to reduce the anti-magic power by creating a scene.`
` ...In that case, there's another move.`
` Having the humans split up should work."`
`"Hmm, that is probably the most effective way.`
` The smaller the number of humans, the more the denominator shrinks.`
` As a result, the magic power becomes instantaneous.`
` In other words, it all begins from one point: how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups.`
` However, they are already very cautious.`
` The barricade won't be destroyed easily, right...?`
` Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.`
` Furthermore, most of the cunning adults have been left this time.`
` The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, correct?`
` ......If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."`
`If the first murder case occurred in a closed circle, the survivors would definitely hole up, `
`gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.`
`......It's almost laughable that not only do mystery authors and murder culprits probably worry about how to break that situation apart, `
`but witches, who supposedly exist at the other end of the spectrum, share in that exact same worry.`
` For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her pointer finger, and after acting as though she was planning something, she spoke.`
`"...............`
`......No, I'm fine.`
` After all, it is a test.`
` ......I won't borrow your moves."`
`"Mu, ...really...?`
` ...Still, it will be pretty hard to defeat this barricade, right...?"`
`"I've already made my move.`
` I'm pretty sure it will work.`
` If that person's smart, then it definitely will."`
`"I, is that so......`
` You really are excellent...`
` I am pleased that my disciple isn't hard to deal with."`
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me.`
` I have to wait for my prey to get nonchalantly lured out."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Well then, handle it with care."`
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and hid herself.`
`......Beato looked as though she didn't find this interesting at all.`
` It seemed she was lonely since she hadn't been relied on at all.`
`"............Every one of them, they don't bother themselves with me. `
`.........Hmm.`
` You witch apprentice, acting so smart...`
`...I'll bet she makes some painful mistake and starts crying.`
` Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and follow my teachings!`
` *cackle*, until then, I shall watch from above."`
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.`
` Beato gave up, and quickly stopped laughing.`
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself.`
`"Excuse me, Milady.`
` ......The game of the second twilight with Battler-sama has ended."`
`"......Mu, I see.`
` Good work.`
` What was the result?"`
`"My sincere apologies.`
` I was forced to resign.`
` ......By saying in red that 'both of them were killed by others', `
`I made Battler-sama revise his claim of 'Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident',`
` ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."`
`"Wasn't Eva sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her?"`
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."`
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!`
` Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that he was in the guest room at the time of the murder?"`
`"......I also thought of that, but, in any event, several important pieces might have been taken several moves later.`
` ...And, because there is a possibility that this move was part of the preparations made by the new Beatrice,`
` I acted out of respect to her.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"Preparations, you say.`
` .........Her mind does seem to be sharp. `
`...Hmm, we can let her do as she likes.`
` It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."`
`"Pu kukukuku.`
` I thought you would say that.`
` ......Your disciple isn't cute, so I can understand your mood."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I wonder how that one plans on destroying this barricade from here on out.`
` I shall keep a close eye on her. `
`............Oh, and...`
`...h, ...how was Battler's mood?"`
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.`
` He did say that he couldn't get fired up without you as his opponent after all."`
`"R, really, that's no surprise, no surprise at all!`
` If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` And with that, if you would excuse me.`
` ...I must bake some delicious cookies.`
` I must at least enliven the discussion between you and Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"Hmm!`
` That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he?`
` It's no surprise that a boy can eat so much.`
` Make a lot of them...!"`
`"Certainly.`
` I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."`
`"That sounds good...!"`
`"......What's going on?`
` What did you want to talk about...?"`
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.`
` It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear.`
`"Umm, I..."`
`"Yeah?"`
`".........want to go outside."`
