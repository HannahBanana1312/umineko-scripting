`"......Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."`
`"Of course, we understand. `
`Still, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker.`
` Now is probably the lightest.`
` Now is the most convenient time."`
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa-san was attacked.`
` This is simply too reckless...!"`
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about it being reckless.`
`...Because Rudolf had said that he was going to the mansion to get food.`
` Certainly, thanks to their fatigue, their hunger was tormenting them.`
` In the beginning, they could fight their hunger just fine because of their drowsiness.`
` However, now it just made their minds hazy, since it was still only midday and their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.`
` The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.`
`"I am opposed to this.`
` It may be a little tough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place."`
`"......We are fine.`
` But it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...`
` I must bear my responsibility as a parent."`
`"D, dear...!`
` Now that Father is dead, you are the Ushiromiya family head.`
` It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"`
`".........You're right.`
` It's like Natsuhi-san says.`
` Krauss-san, you should remain here as the leader."`
`"......Then, who will go to the mansion?"`
`"I think Kyrie and I, and Hideyoshi-san as well, should go. `
`Hideyoshi-san and I are holding guns.`
` They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily."`
`"Rosa-san was also holding a gun, but she was attacked.`
` ...Isn't it dangerous?"`
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria-chan, I was the only one holding a gun.`
` But I wasn't attacked.`
` ......Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man."`
`"Two men.`
` And even two guns.`
` Those two will act as guards, and I'll push the cart with the luggage.`
` I believe the situation will be clearly different from Rosa-san's."`
`"If you're countin' me as a man, I'd be pleased to help. `
`I don't look it, but my body's in pretty good shape for pushin' a cart.`
` Leave the heavy lifting to me!"`
`"It'll be alright if the men devote themselves to guarding.`
` There's a folding cart in the servant room, so using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food. `
`......Of course, we'll be careful.`
` And if we can succeed in this adventure just once, `
`there won't be any need for us to take risks again."`
`"............Is there any way I can get you to rethink that?`
` It may be painful for everyone to deal with an empty stomach, ...but even so, we do not know what is happening outside now..."`
`"We'll take care.`
` ......And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now.`
` We can't let her stay hungry.`
` If her stomach's empty, she can't take her medicine.`
` I have to go out for Eva's sake as well."`
`"How is Eva?"`
`"Looks like she's finally gotten to sleep.`
` ...She has a high fever.`
` If we just leave her be for a while..."`
`"......You can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health...`
`.........Understood.`
` I'll give you permission to go outside."`
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back.`
` A speed contest. `
`Canned food is OK, right?`
` You at least have a can opener here, right?"`
`"Y, yes.`
` We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."`
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink.`
` There's ten people's worth, so no complaining."`
`"Alright!`
` Why don't we dash out and bring it back quickly?`
` There's no time to open umbrellas...!"`
`"So, Aniki.`
` I'll trust you to look after this place."`
`"......Take care.`
` ...Under normal circumstances, I would want to go too. `
`...Being a man, I despise this title of oldest brother that prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."`
`"This is about the only time we get to show off.`
` Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki. `
`Alright, Natsuhi-san.`
` Wait here and get some towels ready or something.`
` We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be soaked to the bone when we get back."`
`"U, understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, `
`each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...`
` Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds had picked up once again.`
` Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.`
` If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.`
` But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.`
` Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.`
`......If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun, `
`then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them a target.`
` It was probably correct to decide on swift action.`
`".........The rose garden.`
` It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!"`
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..."`
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.`
` Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile.`
`......However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.`
` Will they come flying out of the dark? `
`Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?`
`......Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant.`
` But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,`
` they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.`
`"No problems for the first part.`
` ......Unlike how it was for Rosa-san.`
` Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily."`
`"I'd like to believe that.`
` Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."`
`"Sure.`
` Returning home to the mansion with a pair of SP's makes me feel just like an executive."`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` If we had a welcoming party of servants on a red carpet, it'd be perfect."`
`"A welcoming party, you say...`
`...You never know.`
` Be careful."`
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings, `
`Kyrie unlocked the entrance with the master key she had been given.`
`"It's open."`
`"Hideyoshi-san.`
` Could you take the front?`
` I'll keep an eye on the rear."`
`"Understood.`
` Kyrie-san, try not to move from my shadow. `
`......Alright, let's break in!"`
`"Rear guard, understood. Covering...!"`
`"......Men.`
` You're just playing around in a situation like this, aren't you?"`
`"Give it up, that's how men are. `
`......But man, there's still that awful stench."`
`...It felt like the air in the mansion was stagnant with a gloomy silence.`
` And on top of that, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room, `
`and they were struck with an uncontrollable desire to leave the mansion.`
`"No problems in the front.`
` Just a short dash to the kitchen."`
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home.`
` This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench."`
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...`
` And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ......the new witch showed herself there.`
`"They were lured out just as planned.`
` ......Just as planned, they got caught in my trap."`
`The witch grinned.`
`......Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,`
` barely a few hours had passed since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.`
` In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...? `
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic...`
`"What reckless people.`
` ......They will never leave this mansion alive. `
`Close yourself, lock. Mansion!"`
`The instant she proclaimed that...`
` The mansion was sealed off in a separate world.`
`......Unless her barrier were to be broken, no longer could anyone exit this mansion, or enter it.`
`"......Spectacular.`
` To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well. `
`......That talent surprises me.`
` It is almost as though you were born a witch."`
`"Well, I was a witch since the time I was born. `
`......Who taught you how to blink?`
` That's what using magic is like for me."`
`"..................`
`...A fearsome person."`
`The witch's face twisted with brutality.`
`......She just couldn't help looking forward to toying with someone's life again.`
`"Well then...`
`......Gehehehehhihhihihihihihihyahya!`
` First is Rudolf and Kyrie, but what cruel way should I kill them...?!"`
`"......If you would excuse me,`
` but Predecessor-sama has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.`
` And, there is an etiquette for offering the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.`
` For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"......Oh, really?`
` Now that you mention it, that's right.`
` I could only play as I like with that second twilight.`
` ...............Boring.`
` Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa.`
`......But, that refers to the way they're killed in the end, right?"`
`"Yes, as you say..."`
`"So I can just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,`
` and follow the epitaph the last time I kill them, right?`
`......So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem.`
` ......Who'd act well-behaved with an interesting power like this...?! `
`Kuhhihihihihihihi!"`
`Her ranting was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid argument.`
` The etiquette deciding the style of killing for the sacrifices of the fourth twilight and onward were represented by things like 'gouge the head'.`
` However, that referred to the way they died in the end.`
` In other words, ......in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.`
` She just had to keep on reviving them, and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.`
` Even while Ronove felt that her innocent cruelty was a fragment of her talent as a witch,`
` he was beginning to notice a naturally brutal side of her.`
`"......They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see that may be true. `
`.........Do as you wish, ...is what I would like to say, `
`but here, it may actually be wiser to have prudence.`
` They are holding guns.`
` Weapons with a high anti-magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."`
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was unexpectedly afraid of guns.`
`".........That can't be right.`
` Shouldn't witches be able to get by with being shot by a bullet without any trouble?"`
`"No.`
` It would become a fatal wound, exactly the same as it would for a normal human.`
` ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed, `
`most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."`
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"`
`"......Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in preparation and ceremonies.`
` I am afraid to say that Beatrice-sama currently has none of those.`
` Furthermore, you are currently ill prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."`
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets. `
`.........It's annoying, but I don't have a choice.`
` So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"`
`"Yes.`
` Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also a part of a witch's elegant taste.`
` Beatrice-sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."`
`"............I get it. `
`...Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I don't care who, any two of you...!"`
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.`
`"Leviathan of Envy, right here."`
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here."`
`"Show me your power.`
` Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Not Hideyoshi.`
` ......Come on, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."`
`"......My apologies,`
` but we have received an order from the Predecessor-sama to restrain ourselves from unnecessarily cruel actions."`
`"Bu-t, I think the Predecessor-sama's order gives us some leeway to tease them.`
` Is that appropriate?"`
`"Hmm.`
` I get it, I'll compromise. `
`......You can't kill them easily.`
` Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.`
` ......Will that be alright, Ronove?"`
`"Yes. Considering that level, I do not believe there will be a problem."`
`"............Then, go!"`
`""Yes, leave it to us...!""`
`"Your opponents are armed with guns.`
` ...For those such as yourselves, dodging them should be easy, `
`...but if you are hit, it will be a fatal wound.`
` Go with an appropriate level of caution."`
`"Do not worry.`
` We won't expose such a level of incompetence."`
`The two sisters of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory hid themselves.`
` After bowing, Ronove also hid himself.`
`".........There's even rules on how to kill them.`
` .........Why do I have to be constrained by my Predecessor-sama?`
` ............It's so rigid and boring."`
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor Beatrice hung in the hall, she cursed...`
` The three people had already arrived at the kitchen, and were gathering food supplies.`
` Thinking of the possibility that poison had been mixed in, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables,`
` and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.`
` It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.`
` With all of that, there would be plenty for 10 people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast.`
` That would be enough while they waited for the boat.`
` The two men were supposed to be devoted to guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.`
` Hideyoshi, who wanted to show off his power, switched to be the cart-pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.`
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full. `
`It'll be a picnic until we get back, let's go...!"`
`When Hideyoshi vigorously proclaimed their departure, Kyrie frowned, looking as though she was gazing into the distance.`
`......There was a wall in that direction.`
`...No, if her gaze could go through that, the hall was beyond it...`
`".........What is it, Kyrie?"`
`"...It's vague,`
` .........but I have a bad feeling about this."`
`Kyrie stopped, narrowing her eyes even further.`
`".........Women's intuition?"`
`In times like this, Kyrie's intuition surpassed reason.`
`...Rudolf believed that intuition.`
`"Yes.`
` Someone's probably waiting to ambush us.`
` ......I didn't sense them until a short while ago.`
` ...But just now, I felt it. `
`......Just now someone,`
`set up an ambush for us."`
`"......Then, there's no reason we should return the way we came. `
`There's a back door over there, right?`
` Let's leave that way."`
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door.`
` When luggage was carried into the kitchen, it never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.`
` So outside the back door, there was probably a slope to carry things in.`
` Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's stuck.`
` ...Damn, what's going on?"`
`"Can't you open it?"`
`"Nope.`
` Is it broken?`
` It isn't giving an inch..."`
`Rudolf tried various things, using force, then coaxing it,`
` but the lock was as hard as stone, and didn't even budge.`
`"...Don't stress over it. Let's leave through the front entrance.`
` Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wasting time."`
`"........................"`
`"......Are you saying this is a trap?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Be careful."`
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again, and headed for the entrance...`
`"Wh, ......who is it?!!"`
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...`
` In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies covered the area with a gold color.`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` A lowly human predicted our ambush?"`
`"I, it isn't my fault.`
` I was hiding my presence...!"`
`"Don't hesitate!! Shoot!!!"`
`The two guns spouted fire.`
` The lead bullets blasted right through the magic defense the two had as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,`
` ......but the figures of those two, which should have been there, had disappeared.`
` Certainly, guns were frightening objects for them.`
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit.`
` They at least had enough speed to dodge those.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` You won't even let us say our names?! `
`This is why I hate humans!"`
`Leviathan was a full 10 meters from where she had supposedly been, popping her head out from behind the pillars in the shadow of the staircase and protesting.`
`"Following Beatrice-sama's orders, we are to attack you!`
` Our orders tell us to make it take some time and to tease you.`
` You are free to resist, but know that it is useless...!"`
`That voice came from overhead.`
` Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.`
` Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.`
`"......Wh, `
`......what are these girls...?!"`
`"Forget the cart!!`
` We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!"`
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.`
` In the case of a crisis, they had planned to run off in separate directions, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.`
` Fighting was forbidden.`
` ......As long as they could fully escape.`
`"Hah-hah-ha, in a tight spot, escaping is victory...!"`
`The three of them escaped into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.`
` The two furniture calmly watched them go.`
`"......I'll kill the woman.`
` You take the man!"`
`"Understood."`
`The two furniture in the shadows of the pillars and on the chandelier made their figures explode,`
` and, leaving behind only the sound of a hopping beetle knocking against the wall, they pursued their respective targets.`
` Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' path of retreat.`
`"............Why don't I watch the skill of this furniture.`
` It'd be nice if they entertained me..."`
`"Beatrice-sama, I wonder if it is appropriate for you to show yourself unnecessarily..."`
`"You don't unnecessarily move the king into the center.`
` That's part of a king's, `
`...a witch's dignity!"`
`In front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor, Belphegor was already standing in the way.`
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape.`
` ......You don't need to think about anything. `
`Just close your eyes.`
` I'll gently end everything."`
`"You might become a good wife.`
` Your husband would be pleased to hear that kind of thing when he comes home tired."`
`"To think that you're still relaxed enough to speak with such insolence at a time like this...! `
`Beatrice-sama, thank you for such good prey!`
` Die!!!"`
`Rudolf fired first.`
` But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back.`
` She then raised a purple locus springing out from her arm...`
` However, even before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, unbelievably, Rudolf had swung his gun behind him.`
` The barrel remained pointing behind his back, from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed-off gun one-handedly.`
` It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest...`
`*click*, *cha-clunk*...! `
`It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.`
` In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.`
` Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned.`
`".........Not bad.........`
`...For a middle-aged man...!!"`
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves western films, right?`
` Brats don't know anything about the refinement of a lever-action."`
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake in the first floor corridor.`
`"What a moron.`
` You could have just escaped with your husband.`
` You do know that that was your final farewell just now, right...? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` This kind of thing is my husband's specialty.`
` I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon. `
`Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble.`
` ......Not even when when Asumu-san was around, you see?`
` Heheh."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` What a happy couple.`
` I'm jealous.`
` .........I am Leviathan of Envy...!`
` Envy is itself my power.`
` My anger, my origin!"`
`"I agree.`
` Envy is the source of a woman's power.`
` ...And if you call something like that power, I won't lose to a girl like you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!`
` You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!! `
`Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!"`
`The arm Leviathan swung was trailed by a purple locus.`
` It was a magic blade that cut by the power of malice.`
` Kyrie guarded herself against that with her gun.`
`......Even though the magic blade should have cut through the metal like butter, the 'gun', with its extremely high magic resistance power, `
`was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.`
` Rapidly, two times, three times.`
` It blocked all of them.`
` And, without missing the opening created when that purple locus took a swing upward,`
` Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.`
` Almost like she was a lightly dancing feather, Leviathan was knocked away.`
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again...`
` Kyrie had already perfectly captured Leviathan, who was in midair, down the barrel of her gun.`
` From midair, the two women who had spoken to each other of envy as a form of power met each other's gaze.`
`"......C, can you pull it?`
` That trigger...!!"`
`"You know, I can be pretty brutal when my husband isn't around."`
`"Owowowowowowow!!"`
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.`
` He had been gradually chased down by Belphegor, and had been pushed back into the original hall.`
`".........Predecessor-sama's furniture is pretty good.`
` She's lacking in style, though!"`
`"Beatrice-sama...!`
` It isn't over yet, and it's dangerous to show yourself...!"`
`"..................Could you, `
`......possibly be, Eva?"`
`"That used to be my name.`
` But it's different now, Rudolf."`
`"You don't have to tell me.`
` You're going to say you're the Golden Witch, Beatrice, right?"`
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!`
` How did you know?"`
`"......Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a general idea. `
`.........Rosa, forgive me.`
` Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to your hell...!!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, look out!!!"`
`Rudolf mercilessly pointed the barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.`
` But Belphegor could not permit that, and savagely attacked.`
` She dashed, disappeared, and headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...Dodged that shot and again headed for Rudolf's back...`
`...And hid herself over and over, instantly moving into Rudolf's blind spot.`
` It was almost like she was a fairy.`
` As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.`
`"Maybe this is kinda fun.`
` Rudolf, let me leisurely watch and see how long your brave efforts last you. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*!"`
`At that time, a dull tearing sound was mixed in with Rudolf's cry of anguish.`
` Rudolf's reaction to the dance of the purple locus which pressed upon him had finally been too slow,`
` and he had let it lightly cut his flank.`
` A single wound slowed his actions a little.`
` That caused a new wound, which slowed his actions again.`
` Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...`
` Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.`
` Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie hadn't suffered a single fatal wound.`
`".........I really am a moron.`
` ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.`
` I was always slow, always weak, always stupid.`
`......That inferiority complex became envy, `
`and when I convert that into power, I gain a strength greater than that of any of the sisters."`
`"It's important to have a moderate inferiority complex when you're a girl.`
` It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."`
`"But I don't like using the limits of my power against mere humans.`
` ......My envy that you are able to completely trust your husband will turn into power.`
`......I don't like it.`
` Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` I wonder?"`
`"............I get it.`
` You fully believe that your husband will definitely come to rescue you and will save you. `
`.........Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours.`
` It's enough to make me jealous."`
`What kind of trust did we sisters have for each other? `
`The sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other when things already look bad...!`
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters.`
` I've always wanted just one of them to become my ally. `
`......So since you have that single ally who is completely trustworthy, `
`I feel the strongest envy...`
`............Aaah, that expression that fully believes in your husband...!`
` I can feel it giving me power...!!`
` .........I might even surpass that. `
`The speed of sound!!!"`
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.`
`"Since the day that my sisters looked down on me.`
` I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who grew quickly!`
` I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!`
` You can see the power I gained as a result from my speed...!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.`
` The noise from her bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.`
` By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell whether it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.`
` Leviathan was certain of a greater than 100% chance of victory from the bottom of her heart...! `
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.`
`".........I was the one who had been going out with Rudolf-san from the very beginning.`
` ......Asumu-san blatantly cut in between us, `
`...and shrewdly got pregnant.`
`......I don't blame Rudolf-san.`
` That woman used her body as a weapon to seduce him, and then acted even more repulsively,`
` and cornered Rudolf-san so that he was forced to engage her."`
`Asumu-san had been carrying Battler-kun.`
` And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.`
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.`
`"Then, Asumu-san gave birth to Battler-kun.`
` ...But I had a miscarriage.`
` .........There's something I've thought about.`
` What if Asumu-san had been the one to have a miscarriage, and I had been the one to give birth?`
` ......Would Rudolf-san have broken off his engagement and married me?`
` ......But I couldn't give birth to a child.`
` So until Asumu-san died, `
`and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu-san, and was jealous of her."`
`Asumu-san should just die.`
` And then I want him to remarry, with me. In my envy, I kept cursing like that, over and over, until Asumu-san finally died.`
` I was certain.`
` I was certain that I had possessed the power of magic, which had become a curse and killed Asumu-san.`
` But that did not quell the flames of my envy.`
` Don't tell anyone, alright? `
`Every time I look at Battler-kun, I remember that woman.`
` And every time I look at Battler-kun,`
` ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.`
` I am still jealous of her, tormented by her.`
` Even now, and from now on.`
` In the future, for all eternity.`
`"You say that you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"`
`"Th, ......that's right..."`
`Don't make me laugh, girl.`
`".........How could you understand the madness of a woman whose man was stolen from her, `
`and who has burned with envy for 18 years...!!"`
`"u, ......uuowaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`If Leviathan's power had 24 hours x 7 days, or 168 hours of speed...`
` Then the power that Kyrie had piled up, `
`was 24 hours in 1 day, `
`365 days in 1 year, `
`and for 18 whole years......`
` Even without counting leap years, `
`it was 157680 hours.`
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed, `
`it was more than 938 times greater.`
` So then, even if Leviathan could soar at the speed of sound, 1225 km/h,`
` ......to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like `
`1/938 of that.`
` So then, so then, 1225÷938 is, `
`............a speed of, `
`1.30 km/h.`
`...They say that a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.`
` This is almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.`
` So then, so then, so then...! `
`In the time it took the demon stake to move at a pace so slow that you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air, `
`Kyrie looked at it with pity.`
` She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.`
` Then, she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.`
` Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.`
`"You're completely lacking in both love and envy.`
`......Better luck next time, girl."`
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?`
` You're supposed to slice up a fish while it's still jumping.`
` After it dies, it isn't interesting anymore. `
`That's enough.`
` Why not kill you now?!"`
`".........urk, ......damn it......"`
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up. `
`......That's enough.`
` From now on, you don't need to think about anything.`
` I'll steal away your life painlessly...!"`
`"Wait..., there's a favor I want to ask.`
` In the very end, I want to do one of those..."`
`"......What do you mean, one of those?"`
`"One of those things that westerns made famous.`
` That thing where we put our backs together, walk three steps, and then *bang*."`
`"............Ah, a duel. `
`Very well.`
` If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept."`
`Rudolf moved his wound-covered body, and turned his back to her.`
` Belphegor responded, and faced her back to his.`
`...Belphegor had a sense of honesty that was uncommon in a witch's furniture.`
`"Let me warn you.`
` Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,`
` then even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull, I can move instantaneously."`
`"......I can already feel that throughout my body.`
` ...You are faster than a bullet."`
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.`
` Thank me."`
`"......You are an honest person.`
` And a good woman.`
` You might just steal my heart away."`
`"Let's begin.`
` Three steps is alright, correct? `
`.........First, one step."`
`"......Two steps."`
`"......Three steps.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Yep.`
` ......And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps,`
` ......it's my victory, girl."`
`"Whaaat......? `
`........................Ah......!"`
`Rudolf turned around and fired a bullet.`
`......However, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.`
` It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.`
` But a spray of fresh blood flew about.`
`......Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.`
` But before an incarnation of anti-magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.`
`".........What are you doing?`
` Why'd you get hit...?!"`
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.`
`...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did as the pain from the denial of magic...`
`"......Forgive me.`
` I'm a coward of a man."`
`"............Ku, `
`............u..."`
`"Wh, ...what a killjoy.`
` To think that someone who is furniture to a witch could be defeated by a human...! `
`Know your shame.`
` Worthless, indecent...!`
` Why don't you just grovel and die?!"`
`".........Quit it, Aneki.`
` ...This girl could have dodged it.`
` But she didn't.`
`......She realized that you were in the line of fire, Aneki.`
` So this honest girl took it without dodging, and guarded you.`
` In the very end, she noticed that I was {c:86EF9C:pinning} the rook and the king."`
`"S, .........spectacular............"`
`"Don't take it badly.`
` ...I'd planned to resign if you had noticed it while you were taking those three steps."`
`"............Those three steps, `
`...were out of consideration, `
`...for me, were they...? `
`.........I didn't even try to think about it.`
` ......I, `
`......was, `
`...lazy........."`
`"......You were a good woman.`
` Go to heaven before me and do your makeup.`
` I'll definitely come and talk you up."`
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in a human form,`
` and she grew small, like gold dust, and melted into thin air...`
` At that point, Kyrie dashed in.`
` It seemed that she had somehow defeated her pursuer with her own hands.`
` As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound-covered Rudolf.`
`"......Are you alright?`
` Were you talking someone up just now?"`
`"Yep, a good woman.`
` ...No match for you of course. `
`............Sorry, Aneki. `
`It's checkmate."`
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.`
`"............Worthless furniture.`
` ...To think that they would be beaten by human opponents.`
` ...Worthless.`
` Stupid.`
` ...Boring...!"`
`"Beatrice-sama, we should retreat from this place.`
` ......There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."`
`"Eheheheh, `
`......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.`
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.`
`.........Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her, `
`was not one that even a witch could just laugh off.`
` But the witch laughed with pleasure.`
`".........Well, it's only natural that it'd be impossible for Predecessor-sama's worn out furniture. `
`......There's no point unless I have new furniture, suitable for me.`
` I acted out of obligation,`
` ......but I've hated old things from the very beginning."`
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had already finished turning into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Be a good girl and put your hands up."`
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.`
` But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed a her,`
` it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton.`
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!`
` Not that cheap furniture, much stronger ones!`
` Cruel ones!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahyahhyahhya!!!"`
`"Stop this bizarre act...!`
` I'll pull the trigger..."`
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried with the color of gold.`
` As the brilliantly radiant gold butterflies danced,`
` ...it felt as though they were being sucked into an ocean of gold leaf.`
` Ronove was shocked at that upsurge in magic power...`
` That was because it far surpassed that of his former master.`
` As their eyes were dazzled amidst the golden flash, a gunshot could be heard.`
` Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.`
`......Then, after the golden flash had subsided, the witch, who was at least cool and composed, could be seen.`
` The bullet?`
` Hadn't Kyrie fired it into her? `
`But the witch had not been hit anywhere on her body.`
` There it is.`
` ...The bullet had been fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest.`
`"A, ......a bullet-proof barrier........."`
`A barrier which took even the predecessor a significant amount of preparation had, in an instant...`
` Ronove's face was still twisted in shock.`
` And, the surprise did not stop there......`
` The group of gold butterflies had created two humanoid forms.`
`......It was a furniture summoning.`
` The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.`
`"...............The Siesta Sisters Corps...`
`.........Even the predecessor, `
`......wasn't able to summon them on a moment's notice, Pendragon's Memorial Troops, and so easily...!"`
`"Siesta 410. Right he-re."`
`"Siesta 45. Right here."`
`"...You two are suitable furniture for me, right?"`
`"From reading a picture book out loud, to going on a date, to shooting down meteorites,`
` we'll take care of anything. Nihihi."`
`"I, if we don't take care of it, Pendragon-sama will get mad at us...!`
` Please, your orders, great Lady Beatrice!"`
`".........Rudolf-san.`
` Let's escape.`
` These guys are no good......!"`
`"S, .........sure!"`
`Kyrie definitely heard warning sirens going off in her head, `
`thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` Without hesitation, they escaped.`
` As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she ordered her new furniture.`
`"...This is an order.`
` Kill the two who ran away. `
`Then bring the corpses back here.`
` Then I'll bring them back to life, and play with them over and over. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The witch's expression was twisted with an evil smile.`
` Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.`
`"M, ...my apologies.`
` ...The Predecessor-sama said to avoid brutal actions of that type..."`
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.`
`...It was unsatisfying.`
` It was so boring, not being able to let her own power and her own cruelty run wild.`
`......And this furniture of the predecessor, who was telling her to act with prudence, gloomily bore the brunt of her dissatisfaction.`
`"Oh, it's Lucifer of Pride.`
` Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'?`
` Let's play together again sometime.`
` Nihhihihihihihi!"`
`"F, 410, you mustn't whisper, you'll get in trouble...!`
` Let us carry out the great Lady Beatrice's order at once...!"`
`"Nihi.`
` Well, we are on the job right now nyeh. `
`......410, roger.`
` Sniping Pursuit Combat Setup."`
`"Terrain Data Accumulation, Firing Use Data Accumulation.`
` Data Link with 410."`
`"410, Data Received.`
` Target Lock Acquired.`
` Terrain Calculation Error Correction.`
` Firing Curve Formation, Control Point Capture Completed.`
` Data Link to 45."`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Checking Danger Area, ......ah, that's no good!"`
`"You're in the way behind us, Lucifer-chan,`
` you'll get roasted in the backfire, right? Nihi!"`
`".........Ooh..."`
`The Siesta sisters, through their mutual measurements, `
`were able to instantly calculate the terrain inside the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them.`
`...Yes, their shots could be guided to draw a curved line.`
` No one would be able to escape it.`
` The precision guidance ability of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap version of the ability these two held.`
`"45, Firing Preparations Concluded.`
` Ammo Type Selection, Loading."`
`As the two of them faced each other.`
` And as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together.`
`...There, a dazzling gold arrow was readied.`
`"410, nihi.`
` Firing."`
`After they proclaimed that they were firing, together, they released a single arrow.`
` As the curve taken by the gold-sparkling snake of light drew a locus,`
` it followed the direction that Rudolf and Kyrie had escaped to in rapid pursuit.`
` It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.`
` No one could block the guided shots of the Siesta Sisters.`
` No one could escape them.`
` And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.`
`......It was quite a merciless guided weapon of certain death.`
` However, among mythical-class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.`
` It was very commonplace for them, ...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.`
`"Wh, what the...!?"`
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them, and turned around...`
` Rudolf was shot straight through where his heart was located by the gold snake.`
` It all happened in an instant.`
`"R, Rudolf-san......?!"`
`After the gold snake pierced Rudolf, `
`it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest.`
` And just like Rudolf, it shot straight through the location of her heart.`
`...And all of that happened in an instant.`
` It pierced Rudolf, and pierced Kyrie.`
` So they died at almost the same time, dropped to their knees at the same time, and fell over at the same time.`
`"......What's thiiis?`
` So overwhelming, ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Ridiculously easy, isn't it. `
`Kuhhihihyahyahyahyahya!`
` This is the kind of furniture I need.`
` Way different from Predecessor-sama's second-hand furniture! `
`Come on, bring their corpses here.`
` I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and try killing them in as brutal a way as I can think of.`
` Aaah, to think that being a witch could be so much fun, `
`that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`......From the time they are born, the most shunned action for humans to take is murder of another human.`
` It's only natural that a human couldn't understand how pleasurable it was to break this taboo.`
`......But she was no longer a human.`
` She was a witch.`
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.`
` By now, she had tasted those pleasures, and was totally immersed in them.`
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without it.`
`......No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.`
` Anyways, by killing humans gruesomely, `
`and doing it over and over, she could feel the drug-like pleasure even now.`
` As the witch rolled over laughing, `
`the gold snake which had just been shot returned as though being pulled back.`
` At the tips, two people were pinned and dragged along.`
` The witch's order had been fulfilled.`
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their corpses had been carried back.`
`"Siesta 45, 410, execution of orders completed.`
` We await your next order, great Lady Beatrice.`
` Please, your order...!"`
`"From babysitting, to being your opponent in an online game, `
`to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything.`
` Nihihi!"`
`".........It looks like these two are the sacrifices from the fourth twilight and the fifth twilight.`
` So in the end, I need those worthless Seven Sisters, `
`...oh, aren't they the Five Sisters now?`
` I need those guys to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest.`
`......But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way until then, right? `
`Eheheheheheheheheh!"`
`"Wait wait wait waait.`
` ...Have you already forgotten what I've told you?!"`
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor-sama.`
` Do you have any complaints?"`
`"Of course I do...!`
` You are doing as you please, are you not?!`
` Why can't you follow my directions?!"`
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor-sama?`
` And I don't feel like deviating from the rules of the ceremony in the slightest.`
` I'll definitely clean these two corpses up later, and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."`
`"I'm telling you, that is not the problem...!`
` If you act so undignified and cruel, `
`...umm, some people might take it badly..."`
`"........................`
`......You mean, your opponent in that game, who I heard you were fighting with somewhere?`
` Ronove told me."`
`"......D, damn that blabbermouth. `
`.........Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is.`
` If you go a little too far, umm, `
`...that person will object, you see?"`
`"It's not like there's any need for them to tell you to pass it on instead of objecting directly.`
` ...That coward."`
`".........Well, that person is a resident of a different world from this one.`
` There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary.`
` Well, that's beside the point but-"`
`"..................`
`......Which means that this person can't interact with me even if they want to.`
` And I can't interact with them even if I want to either.`
` Should I view this as an unrelated person from a world so far away?"`
`"H, hmm.`
` ......For example, perhaps you could say these worlds are like very close parallel lines.`
` The worlds are very nearby, but because they are parallel lines, they will never cross.`
` For the time being, you may view that world in such a manner."`
`"They never cross.`
` Which means, `
`............that world has nothing to do with me. `
`...If you're telling me to be prudent because you are speaking for that person, please pass this message on to them."`
`"Tell that person?`
` What should I say...?"`
`"It's none of your business, so disappear, granny. `
`Why don't you just give up and die...?"`
`"...............Whaa..."`
`"...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` Since it was a friend of yours, I just imagined that she'd be a woman. `
`By 'granny', I'm definitely not talking about you, Predecessor-sama, so please forgive me. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes.`
`...Anyone in that place would be able to figure it out just by looking.`
`"............Predecessor-sama.`
` There is something I find very strange.`
` ...Why do you have to play a game with someone from another world, `
`and have him accept that you are a witch?"`
`"Well, about that,`
` ...that is because making all humans accept the existence of witches is related to perfect control.`
` There was a single holdout, and he just won't accept me as a witch."`
`".........Why is it that you need the approval of a human?`
` Witches are witches, and can use magic, so why do we need to be accepted by humans?"`
`"...Mu, .........well, like I said earlier, that which is called magic is..."`
`"I am a witch.`
` I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point......?"`
`"In this world, right?`
` However, since that person will not accept it, umm, `
`...umumu, how should I explain it..."`
`"......I don't need an explanation.`
` After all, isn't this all about a different world that never crosses this one?`
` In other words, it's just as though that world doesn't exist.`
`............Whether you're fighting in a game in another world, or talking about your delusions, that doesn't change a-nything.`
` ......I'll say it again.`
` It has nothing to do with me.`
` And, I am already a witch."`
`"Predecessor-sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't accept you, but I'm different.`
` Even though no one has accepted me, I am already an excellent witch.`
` .........Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,`
` but that is out of good will, not out of duty.`
`......I won't ask for your advice anymore,`
` because I clearly know what I should do and how I should play from now on.`
`.........So I will carry out the murder of 13 people as a final act of respect for you.`
` However, there is absolutely no reason for you to interfere with the methods I use,`
` and what I do after that.`
` ...............Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard."`
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear distinction.`
`...She was no longer under Beato's care for anything.`
` So she was clearly saying nothing more than 'Don't get in the way of my fun'.`
` Beato understood that, `
`...and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand.`
`"...I, ............I see...`
` Then it is no longer my problem...`
` Go and learn with your own body how magic ceases to exist when you lose your feelings of respect for it."`
`"......I wish you would tell me how that carefree rampage of yours up until now`
` can be called respect."`
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond.`
`......Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her teacher.`
`"So.`
` Siesta Sisters?`
` See off my predecessor on her way back."`
`"Nihihihihi.`
` Predecessor-sama, please retire from this place."`
`"I, if you don't, we'll be scolded...!"`
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something that couldn't be seen by the Siesta Sisters' eyes, which could only be described as an oppressive feeling.`
`......Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.`
` It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.`
` Even Beato could not escape from the Siesta Sisters' attack without any preparation.`
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew how terrifying they were down to her very soul.`
`".........Predecessor-sama, if you would retire.`
` .........I would not recommend damaging Beatrice-sama's mood any further."`
`"......Predecessor-sama..."`
`"I, .........I understand.`
` ...I shall leave for now. `
`......I shall slowly appreciate the circumstances you will put yourself in!"`
`That was almost a sharp parting remark.`
`...So after Beato hid herself, the witch and her furniture fell over laughing...`
`"............Well, I understand.`
` Endless power is fun.`
` ...The joy of freely toying with an extremely limited life cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.`
` ......I can understand the feeling of being possessed with a pleasure similar to drugs."`
`"......It must have been quite fun.`
` Judging from your antics in the past."`
`"Are you saying it is like how you used to admonish me in the past, Teacher, and I did not listen...?"`
`".........Why is it that you have started trying to scold that child's actions?"`
`"Mu, ......umm, well. `
`.................."`
`"...This is a single large difference between you and that child.`
` That child may already be a witch.`
` Of course, you are also a witch.`
` In the world on top of the game board.`
`......However, to be accepted as a witch outside the game board,`
` you need to have your opponent in this game, Battler-kun, accept you.`
` ......You must have understood that when you started the game."`
`"......I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,`
` blow away his feelings that made him deny me, and make him surrender, `
`.........he would accept me as a witch.`
` ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."`
`"It's actually the opposite.`
` Battler-kun was shocked by your brutality.`
` And he did not step up to the plate as a game opponent simply because he accepted you as an equal opponent.`
` It was based on a strong animosity, as he tried to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."`
`".........In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler-kun's self-awareness as your opponent was a first step `
`towards making him accept that you are a witch.`
` However, it was actually the opposite."`
`"Battler-kun challenged you in this game because he definitely wouldn't accept you as a witch.`
` ......No matter how much the thoughtless north wind blew, the traveler only wore his cloak even tighter.`
` You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."`
`"............This game is not torture to make Battler-kun surrender.`
` It is a test, in which you must try to make Battler-kun accept you."`
`"............`
`...Uu, `
`......I've vaguely, `
`...noticed that..."`
`"Last time, it was a tough game for Battler-kun. `
`But it seems that you've already noticed.`
` ......This time, the game is tough for you."`
`"Wh, ...what should I do from now on?"`
`"Think about it yourself.`
` ......Fortunately, you have already given up your pieces on the game board to the new witch.`
` You should have time to deliberately ponder upon yourself."`
`"............Isn't Battler's soul already hostile towards me?`
` He won't accept witches, so he won't accept me.`
` ......In that case, what can I do so that Battler will accept me...?`
` Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?`
` I should, after all this time......?"`
`"It is October now.`
` The Halloween season.`
` .........It is the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.`
` When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may not reach far through the cold winter winds.`
` However, it slowly grows, and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.`
` ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."`
`".........Are you saying, `
`......that I am mistaken.........?"`
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered with a golden sparkle like gold leaf,`
` ...and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.`
` The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.`
` The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired.`
`...She just couldn't hide her ragged breaths caused by her still uncontainable excitement.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!!`
` How fun it is to do as I will with the life and death of people!`
` Before the power of the Endless Witch, the endless everything I paint with my mind becomes reality!`
` No matter how sloppily I mash them, `
`I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers.`
` Because in the end, I just have to return the corpses to normal and follow the epitaph like it's an excuse. `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`......Hey, you guys,`
` have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?"`
`"Never, nihi.`
` What about you, 45?"`
`"N, no...!`
` I have never done it, my apologies...!"`
`"That's understandable.`
` Normally, you wouldn't.`
` Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.`
` But I've always thought about it.`
` I always thought about peeking in, `
`and seeing what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal that I loved."`
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.`
`......So even though you want to see, you can't.`
` You understand that feeling, right?`
`"......The power of the Endless Witch can truly grant that wish.`
` ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want.`
`......And yet, with a bit of magic, I can return it to normal and revive it.`
` ...In other words, it means that I have broken all limitations in this world.`
` ......As I am now, I don't have to hesitate or give up an idea or anything.`
` That joy, ......aah, there's probably no one who can understand it.`
` No one other than me, the Golden Witch!!"`
`As the witch let out a mad war cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,`
` and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.`
`......As she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.`
`"...Q, `
`............quit it, Eva......!"`
`"Huh? `
`......Ah, you.`
` You're here."`
`In the tragic hall, Hideyoshi showed himself, his gun readied.`
` The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.`
`...He had probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun, and come back.`
` It seemed that the gun, which should have been something to be feared, was no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magic power.`
` Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest.`
`".........Why did you have to kill Rosa-san and Maria-chan, `
`......and Rudolf-kun and Kyrie-san......?!"`
`"Huh?`
` I am the head of the Ushiromiya family, the witch of Rokkenjima.`
` Everything that occurs on this island is all up to me.`
` ...Just isolating this one instant and asking about their life and death is meaningless to me."`
` `
`"......After findin' Father's gold, .........you went mad...!`
` Just how high was that gold piled?`
` I can't even guess.`
` It must have been enough to make you lose your sanity...`
`......Still, if there was that much gold,`
` ......why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!"`
`"You misunderstand.`
` ............All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.`
` No one is qualified to touch it except for me.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"......What are you?`
` Are you trying to say that you're that thing Eva told me about long ago......the witch Eva from when she was young?"`
`"That's right.`
` I am the youth me, who was always living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...And I'm a witch. `
`.........Eva became an adult by forgetting me.`
` So she can't use magic."`
`"...When they're children, anyone's head might be filled with innocent yet cruel delusions sometimes.`
` When I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies.`
` .........However, I learned the importance of life, and graduated from that cruel childhood age.`
`"......Right now, you really are a child!`
` ...A personality that Eva should have graduated from!`
` That isn't Eva.`
` It's a different human!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I am not Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!`
` I don't have to apologize for breaking the goldfish bowl,`
` and I can tear the stuffed animal as much as I want!`
` I-"`
`There was a dry sound.`
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face.`
` By looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.`
` But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her, and hit her on the cheek.`
`"....................."`
`"You fool!! `
`Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weakling! `
`I'll have to correct it again, that evil nature of yours!!`
` You fool! `
`Fool!!"`
`"Ow, `
`......ouch, `
`...hey...!"`
`"Weren't you a woman who understood how important, how fragile a life is?!`
` I'll make you remember...!!`
` What do you mean by 'witch', you stupid fool!! `
`You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva! `
`A witch of the kitchen, who can considerately make snacks out of leftovers in the refrigerator every once in a while, is as much as I can handle!!`
` Won't you open your eyes, you fool...?!!"`
`"Didn't I just say, `
`...that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva......?!"`
`"You stupid fool!!`
` You! `
`You!!"`
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head.`
` He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore.`
` Therefore.`
` That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.`
`......The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's corpse, floated into the air,`
` ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.`
` And the bullet?`
`.........A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest of Hideyoshi's vest.`
` Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet had been driven into Hideyoshi's chest.`
`".........E, `
`...va............`
`............uu..."`
`"...Like I said, I'm not Eva.`
` What a stupid, annoying man. `
`......You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice of the sixth twilight to you.`
` ...And if you had just hidden under a bed shaking or something, I had planned to let you go.`
` ......You went to all the trouble of coming back.`
` You really are a stupid man."`
`*thunk*...`
` There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.`
` Even though he would have been able to escape that pain when he died, he resisted until the last second,`
` and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away.`
` Because he had died without closing his eyes, the witch didn't realize that he was dead for a short while,`
` and remained pinned down by that gaze.`
`"Will we make this one a new toy and play?`
` Nihi."`
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.`
`".........Nn, ...yeah.`
` ...Right, what'll we do..."`
`The Siesta Sisters waited for instructions.`
` On the inside, they imagined an order even more brutal than before from their master.`
` But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she had gotten over her excitement.`
` She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it...`
`"......It's such a killjoy, and it's all this guy's fault.`
` I'm a-ll done.`
` .........Ronove, are you there?"`
`"Yes, right here."`
`"Clean up the rest please.`
` ...The Predecessor-sama will be annoying.`
` Please make it clean enough so that that granny will accept it. ......I'll follow the rules of the ceremony more or less, out of responsibility to my Predecessor-sama.`
` Please make these three corpses the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight. `
`Lucifer, it's your turn."`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."`
`"I, ...in the corpses?"`
`"That's right.`
` You have a problem with that?"`
`"N, ...no..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had a modest sense of pride.`
` It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.`
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that feeling.`
` Of course, that was not the witch's intention, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.`
`...However, they had already messed up, with two of the sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.`
` Only Ronove appreciated that, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.`
`"......It is Beatrice-sama's order.`
` Lucifer, carry the three, and deal with them according to the etiquette of the ceremony.`
` Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."`
`"Certainly......"`
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that the now delicate atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault.`
`".........Stupid man.`
` And you didn't even have to die."`
`"Dear......!!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Dear, where are you?!`
` You're there, right?`
` Answer me!!"`
`The sound of a loud thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.`
` If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.`
` However, Hideyoshi, who had supposedly sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.`
`"Dear, `
`...answer me..., `
`.........dear...!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
