`Rosa returned to the lobby.`
` It was still her time to rest,`
` but her expression made it look as though she couldn't sleep deeply with all this tension.`
`"......Take it easy and lie down.`
` It'll get tough later on at this rate."`
`"Thanks for your concern.`
` I just can't sleep. `
`......If you just let me take a shower, that will be enough.`
` The next person can rest."`
`"What about you two, Kyrie-san? Rudolf-san?"`
`"......What will we do, Rudolf-san?`
` Will we rest?"`
`"You can rest.`
` I'll stay awake.`
` That's the only manly thing I can do right now."`
`"Then I'll stay awake.`
` Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` You two truly are close."`
`"You should talk.`
` *giggle*."`
`"It seems that Eva and Hideyoshi-san are out cold.`
` It appears as though unlike Rosa, they can't fight against their age."`
`As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open.`
` Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room.`
`"That's none of your business. `
`...Oh, Rosa, are you still alright without sleeping?"`
`"You should talk, Nee-san.`
` Why not take it easy and rest?"`
`"............I just can't get to sleep.`
` After taking a shower, my drowsiness faded away.`
` Rudolf, Kyrie-san, you can rest if you want."`
`"Sure, thanks.`
` Well, I appreciate the sentiment. `
`Why don't you go first, Aniki?"`
`"How kind of you.`
` But I cannot rest first.`
` That is the most I can do as the oldest brother."`
`"Do not worry, the two of us will be awake until the very end."`
`"......*giggle*. `
`.........More importantly, Eva nee-san,`
` are you alright?`
` You look a little pale."`
`"......Come to think of it, you're right. `
`......Hmmm?`
` Could it be a bit of a fever?"`
`Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva's forehead.`
`...It seemed that Eva wasn't feeling her best.`
`"That goes without saying.`
` ...It's because you broke your daily cycle at your age.`
` ......Is it a cold?"`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Could you call Doctor Nanjo down?"`
`"Y, yes."`
`"...I'm fine, you don't have to make such a big deal out of it.`
` I have some medicine, so I'll be fine. `
`......I tend to get a fever when I'm tired.`
` Don't worry."`
`"......Nee-san, take it easy, okay?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...If the siblings were gathered without me around, I get the feeling everyone would start talking behind my back. `
`...It's a persecution complex from long ago.`
` Sorry, okay?"`
`"............I won't say anything.`
` To think that I would say something bad about you when you're away, Nee-san."`
`"........................"`
`"......What is it?`
` Nee-san, you've been acting strange for a while?`
` Shouldn't you get a little rest now?"`
`"............You're right.`
` Just thinking about raising money by March makes my headache hurt even worse."`
`"That isn't good.`
` Rest. `
`...I'll restrain myself so that your headache doesn't get worse.`
` I've had a bad headache myself for a while now."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Well then, I'll count on what you've said and rest for a while."`
`"What is it, Eva?`
` Why so angry all of a sudden? `
`......Sorry, please let us rest a bit longer.`
` My apologies..."`
`After apologizing several times as though praying, `
`Hideyoshi went after Eva, and left the lobby.`
`"............I don't like this atmosphere.`
` Everything's so strained."`
`"That's no surprise.`
` ......There was a murder early this morning.`
` And since then, we've been eating canned food and holding guns.`
` ...It's natural that we would start to build up stress."`
`"I wonder if the kids up there are also building up stress.`
` ......I'm worried about Maria.`
` She tends to get irritable in times like this."`
`At that time, they heard the sound of wild footsteps from the second floor.`
` The guesthouse wasn't a cheap building, so they wouldn't normally have heard the sound of footsteps.`
` It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration.`
` And in a flash, in addition to the sound which seemed to be caused by her running around the second floor,`
` they could hear Maria calling uu-uu-uu- over and over again, sounding displeased.`
` Rosa grabbed her head, her hair flying, and she voicelessly moaned in anguish...`
` The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice.`
` The noisy clamor came down from the second floor and flew into the lobby.`
` It was Maria, who was sobbing, along with the other children and Nanjo.`
`...In other words, they had all come downstairs because of Maria's tantrum.`
` Rosa couldn't hide her dizziness at this new annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone...`
`"S, sorry, Rosa oba-san...`
` We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn't listen..."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"...What is it, Maria?`
` Could you be a little more quiet?`
` Everyone's looking."`
`"It's that rose of hers from the rose garden...`
` She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it."`
`"......It looks like she's half asleep.`
` She suddenly woke up, and started going on about how worried she was for that rose. `
`.........Maria-chan, calm down.`
` That was just a dream..."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!`
` That was Beatrice's and Maria's ro-se!! `
`So if Maria doesn't take care of it, Beatrice will get ma-d!!`
` It might be broken again!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"......Aaah, `
`...I'm telling you to quiet down a bit, alright?!?!"`
`The sudden rise in the tone of Rosa's voice surprised the children.`
` But Maria's crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer.`
`"R, ...Rosa-san.`
` You mustn't scold a child unsparingly...`
`...In times like this, it is good to give them some warm milk or something."`
`"......Is there any here?"`
`"After taking the milk out for breakfast earlier, it is now empty..."`
`"Doesn't anyone have a sedative to use on kids...?`
` You know, those silver pill things?"`
`"I have them!! `
`Yes, I'll search for them now and give them to her!!"`
`Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed the handbag that had been set on the sofa and fished around for some medicine.`
` ......It seemed that she had brought some child-use sedatives for Maria's tantrums.`
` She found it and opened the bottle, but it must have been empty.`
` Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn't change the fact that nothing was in there.`
`...As she did that, Maria's crying grew even more intense...`
` At that time, Eva was lying on the bed, covered by the bedding.`
` Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water.`
`"......My, this is one nasty fever...`
`......I'm sure it's the poisonous air at this family conference that got you...`
`......For now, you can forget all about the other relatives.`
` ...Alright?"`
`As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief on Eva's burning forehead.`
` Eva rested her own hand on top of his.`
`".........Your hand, `
`...feels pleasantly cool."`
`"If my hand feels pleasant, your fever must be pretty bad.`
` Don't worry, the medicine will start workin' soon.`
` Plus, my hand is a magic hand.`
` If I just put my hand up against your forehead like this, `
`any fever will melt right away."`
`"You're right.`
` ......Your hand always makes my fevers fade..."`
`"Yep.`
` No need for a doctor when you've got my hand.`
` Don't worry and close your eyes.`
` ......The fever will fade away thanks to my magic..."`
`"Yes, I know...`
`......I can feel your magic."`
`Hideyoshi was about to call that the placebo effect, but he stopped.`
`......If Eva said that she could feel magic from his hand, then that was alright for now...`
`"............I wonder if magic really exists."`
`"Yeah.`
` It does.`
` Only those who believe can understand, though.`
` ...There's actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world."`
`"...If magic actually exists, ......then I wonder if witches actually exist too."`
`"Oh?`
` You mean that witch of the forest, Beatrice?`
` She probably does exist for those who believe.`
` Just like God.`
` Won't show itself except in front of those who strongly believe."`
`"............It's the same with me.`
` ...Long ago, I was able to use magic."`
`"Oh.`
` Really?`
` Then you were also a witch."`
`"......You know, I had a dream that I wanted to come true no matter what.`
` After wishing strongly and trying hard, it came true without fail.`
` ......With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president, and worked hard to get into the university I wanted.`
` ......Everything I wished for was granted."`
`"That's right.`
` Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with...`
` You're definitely a witch.`
` ...And you work harder than anyone.`
` ......I know a-ll about it."`
`"............You know, `
`when I was a kid, the whole time, there was another me inside myself, who always supported me.`
` ...And that other self was a witch.`
`.........I didn't believe in Beatrice, the witch of the forest.`
` I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart.`
` .........I was so grateful to that witch inside myself.`
` ...I was always grateful, ......that she let me meet up with you..."`
`"............You're always too timid when you get sick. `
`...Don't say anythin' for now.`
` ......I'll stay like this the whole time, until your fever has gone down."`
`"......Yes. `
`......No matter what, `
`......don't take your hand away.`
` .........Somehow, `
`......I feel like I'm becoming something that isn't myself, `
`......and I've been scared for a while now.`
` ...I get the feeling that the witch inside of me, `
`was provoked by Beatrice, and is growing stronger and stronger.`
` ...Somehow, it feels like she's going to swallow me up."`
`"It's alright.`
` As long as I'm with you, there's no-thing to be afraid of!`
` Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus was robbed?`
` I repelled 'em!"`
`"...Didn't you just hand over your gold watch and beg them to go away?`
` ......It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool...`
`............No matter what,`
` ...don't move your hand away...`
`......Not even if I fall asleep.`
` ......And even if something creepy sneaks inside, `
`...protect me..."`
`"Yep, leave it to me.`
` ......That's why I'm tellin' you to stop worryin' and get to sleep.`
` Because the medicine and my magic will start workin' real soon..."`
`Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes.`
`......At that time, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby.`
` It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, `
`and screams of uu-uu- could be heard, along with Rosa's rebuking yells.`
`...That probably hurt Eva's ears.`
` Or maybe she was holding back a headache.`
` Eva moaned as though in pain, and buried herself in the covers.`
` It was easy to guess what was happening.`
` Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby,`
` and started arguing with Rosa as she scolded her daughter.`
`...And then, perhaps, that was too pitiful to be shown in front of the other relatives, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor.`
`......Hideyoshi had no desire to interfere with Rosa and Maria's problem.`
`...But just for now, since Eva's condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else.`
`"...Wait just a second.`
` I'll ask them to keep it down."`
`".........C, come back quickly..."`
`"Don't worry, I won't leave this room."`
`Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor.`
` He immediately met Rosa's gaze.`
`"...Everythin' alright, Rosa-san?"`
`"I'm sorry, did all this noise wake you up...?"`
`"Uu-uu-! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"...Maria-chan, sorry.`
` Eva oba-san isn't feelin' well, and she's tryin' to sleep.`
` Could you quiet down a bit...?"`
`Maria's tone didn't change after being asked by Hideyoshi.`
` She kept crying uu-uu- and repeating 'Maria's rose, Maria's rose'.`
` Rosa slapped Maria's cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth,`
` and dragged her towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi's room.`
`...She would still probably be lively for a while, but he had warned Rosa for the time being.`
` Relying on Rosa's actions as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door.`
`".........Is Maria-chan having a tantrum again?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` ...It's tough for Rosa-san too. `
`......Come to think of it, our George is almost too good to be true.`
` We should be grateful."`
`"............You're right.`
` .........Nn, `
`......hand."`
`"Oh, sorry, sorry.`
` ......Look, it's the magic hand."`
`He put his hand on Eva's forehead again.`
`......Maybe there really was magical power in that hand.`
` A truly peaceful look rose to Eva's face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep.`
` As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead......`
` By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria's mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next.`
` She hadn't been able to withstand everyone's gazes in the lobby,`
` and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, dashing out of the lobby.`
` Then she had gone out into the corridor, only to have Hideyoshi say that she was too noisy.`
` Where should I go now?`
`......Where should I take this child who's having a tantrum? `
`She felt as though tears of frustration were about to come out...`
` As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria's ear,`
` and tried to persuade Maria in a properly calm voice.`
`".........Maria, do you really want to see the rose that much...?"`
`Maria nodded her head several times, moaning uu-uu-.`
`"...Why do you want to see the rose that much?`
` I'll listen as your mother, so will you tell me quietly?`
` I'll hit you if you scream."`
`"............Maria's rose...`
` Beatrice revived it.`
` ......It might have broken again...`
`...Maria's worried about that...`
` Can't sleep until she makes sure..."`
`In any event, it seemed that she was still upset about that marked rose from yesterday.`
` Rosa felt her headache throbbing again,`
` but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming.`
`"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now.`
` So don't bother Mama and everyone else.`
` ......You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining.`
` So for now, listen to me...!"`
`"No.`
` ...No no no no.`
` Maria's Beatrice's rose...`
`...uuuu..., uu-uu-.`
` Waaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`Rosa reflexively covered Maria's mouth.`
` She had spoken a little too harshly, and had gotten her agitated again...`
` Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self-hatred.`
` But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer...`
`"...I'm begging you, be quiet...`
` What can I do to make you stop crying?`
` What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?"`
`"......"`
`Suddenly.`
` Maria stopped crying so fast that it seemed unnatural.`
`......Then she turned around, and muttered.`
`"............`
` If Maria can see her rose, Maria will be quiet until tomorrow."`
`"Really?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...If we go to the rose garden and see Maria's rose, Maria will be obedient."`
`"..............."`
`"Really, Mama."`
`"........................"`
`If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being, `
`Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay.`
` She thought it might be a bit reckless.`
`............But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred.`
` All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo.`
` If you carefully thought about that chain of closed rooms, it clearly had to all be an act...`
`"......Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?"`
`"Yes.`
` Really, Mama. `
`......Kihihi."`
`"........................"`
`"Ouch."`
`Rosa didn't overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist.`
` And she shrugged, as though giving up.`
`"......Understood.`
` If it's just one look, then I'll agree.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Yes, Mama.`
` I promise.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun.`
`......It's alright.`
` It's only a farce.`
` There was never a murderer on this island in the first place...`
`"Damn it, wait, Rosa oba-san...!!`
` Are Rosa oba-san and Maria......, the sacrifices for the second twilight?!`
` Damn it damn it damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!!`
` What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!"`
`"Hmm.`
` They are being considerate of Rosa's pitiful relationship with her daughter, and are forcibly changing the subject.`
` The group you are in went up to the second floor, and are talking about something else while watching TV."`
`"You bastards!! `
`Someone, notice them!`
` Who's the closest, is it Hideyoshi oji-san?!`
` Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"It won't reach, it won't reach, *cackle*!`
` Don't disturb their precious time together.`
` Fuhahahahahahaha...!"`
`Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva's forehead.`
` He didn't notice that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door at all.`
` In that case, there was no way that the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice.`
` And the cousins' room on the second story was even worse...!`
`"Why are you so panicked?`
` Didn't you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident at the first twilight?`
`...Doesn't that mean that there is no longer a culprit on this island...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, what is there to be so worried about...?"`
`"Shut up, I can see right through you!! `
`Someone stop them, those two'll be killed!!`
` Someone, stop theeeeeeeeeeeeeeem, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`......There was no way that Battler's voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria.`
` The two of them could be seen in the rose garden.`
` The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little.`
`...No, maybe that wasn't fortunate.`
` Because maybe, if the wind had been a little fiercer, Rosa might have hesitated to go outside...`
`"......Uu-, uu-, uu-...`
`............Here it is...!"`
`Maria found her own rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly.`
` Rosa had accepted with the promise that Maria would only have one look at it, `
`but she didn't want Maria to complain that it hadn't been enough later on, `
`so she decided to go along with Maria until she was satisfied.`
`......She believed that there wasn't a culprit,`
` but on the offchance that she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position.`
` Rosa realized that faintly herself.`
` If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun.`
`...After glancing at Maria's innocent happiness, Rosa gazed warily in all directions.`
`.................................?`
`......Were her eyes just tired? `
`Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden.`
`...Gold-colored......? `
`It had to be her imagination.`
` Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes...`
`"......Are you alright, Eva...?`
` ...Just take it easy...and should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!"`
`"I......, ......I'm alright...`
`......Don't take your hand away......`
`...I'm begging you, ......don't take your hand away......"`
`Eva was breathing wildly.`
` Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead.`
` It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning.`
` It wasn't odd that her body wasn't keeping up.`
`......Even though he understood that,`
` Hideyoshi suspected that this sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness.`
` Several times, Hideyoshi decided to call Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly, `
`...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn't take his hand away...`
`"I understand...`
` But you must have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime.`
` If you can promise me that, I'll stay here the whole time, grippin' your hand.`
` Tightly, like this."`
`"......Thank you...`
`......I'm fine...`
` The magic of your hand will definitely make this fever subside......"`
`Even as she said that, Eva's harsh breathing didn't improve in the slightest.`
`"......Haah, `
`......haah, `
`......haahh...`
`......Don't let go, `
`...don't let go......, `
`haah, `
`......haahh, `
`............aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Wh, ............who is it...?!"`
`She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush.`
` Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun...`
` When she did, the shadow of a person beyond the bush, ......showed itself.`
`".........Uu-?`
` ......Eva oba-san............`
`.........?"`
`"...You scared me.`
` It's you, Nee-san? `
`............Do you have some business?`
` ...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?"`
`"........................`
`...Yes, that's right.`
` Our discussion about Father's gold."`
`"......Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria.`
` I will keep my promise, alright?`
` I won't get in the way of your conspiracy."`
`"............Conspiracy?`
` What's that?"`
`".........Whatever you're thinking, that's up to you.`
` I have no desire to get in the way.`
` So please, not in front of Maria.`
` As long as I get my share, that will be enough."`
`"Your share? `
`Heheheheh, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`Eva started laughing in a creepy voice...`
` Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly.`
`.........Then Maria said just one thing.`
`".........Uu-......?`
` ............Oba-san, `
`............who are you...?"`
`"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Your share?!`
` Who would give that to you...?!`
` All of that is mine!`
` It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-...!"`
`"Eva! Are you alright, Eva?! `
`Eva!`
` Eva!!"`
`"Hold on...!!`
` Don't let go!!`
` It's like I'm being taken away by someone who isn't me...!!`
` Hold on to my hand...`
` Don't let goooooooooooooo...!!!"`
`"When did you ever work hard?!`
` You never worked hard for anything!`
` You were always hiding in our shadows!`
` You always escaped from shadow to shadow without fighting, `
`and yet, you really think yourself qualified to ask me for the Ushiromiya family gold...?! `
`All of that is mine!`
` It's all only mine, as the head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of Beatrice!!"`
`".........Beatrice. `
`............It's Beatrice!! `
`Mama, Beatrice!"`
`Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy.`
`...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high.`
`"......Hey, you're Nee-san, right......?`
` ......You are Nee-san, right......?"`
`"That's wrong.`
` ...I am no longer the one who was your sister."`
`"Then who are you?!!`
` Are you going to say that you're Beatrice?!`
` That's impossible!`
` You died 19 years ago!!! `
`Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw that your head was smashed.`
` I can remember your insides flowing out like it was yesterday! `
`How could you be alive and right here noooooooooow?!?!"`
`"The concept of death does not exist to a Golden Witch.`
` The Golden Witch and the name of Beatrice will be handed down for all eternity.`
` Maybe the Beatrice you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...!`
` Because it is eternal! `
`The concept of death does not exist for Beatrice!!"`
`".........All I see is that you've gone mad because of that gold.`
` ......How pitiful, Nee-san...!"`
`"You know I'm not your sister anymore.`
` ......Well then, as the new Beatrice, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ceremony.`
`.........Ronove!`
` What should I do?!"`
`"That is up to you.`
` Beatrice-sama already has the power to make whatever she thinks reality.`
` You should grow used to it if you use it a little."`
`"......You worthless former sister.`
` You should consider it an honor to have been selected as the first sacrifice I offer as a witch.`
` At the second twilight, I'll tear the two who are close apart with my own hands...!!"`
`The first thing the new Beatrice wished,`
` ......no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans.`
`...In particular, gravity.`
` She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles.`
` As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were...`
`......The ground retreated all by itself, into the distance below them.`
` By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground.`
` Rosa finally realized that the ground wasn't retreating into the distance below them, `
`but that she and the witch were being sucked up into the rainy sky.`
`"............huh...?`
` ...............Eeeek...?!"`
`"Wh, .........whoooooooooaaaa...... Awesome......!"`
`For a human shackled to the ground by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving that having their feet stop sticking to the ground.`
`......However, to Beatrice, who knew the joy of being released from gravity as the new witch,`
` it was enough to cause her whole body to shake with delight.`
`"......Hey, Rosa.`
` Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it'd be like to become witches and fly around the sky? `
`......That dream has been granted, right?`
` I became a real witch and granted it for you."`
`"S, ............stop it, .........wake me from this dream......"`
`"You said it.`
` You said that you flew through the sky in your dream.`
` And you also said that you hadn't wanted to wake up.`
` You were even mad at me since I had woken you up, right? `
`......Don't worry.`
` This time, you won't wake up, alright? `
`Heheheheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky.`
` Didn't we both wish we could fly like seagulls in the sky,`
` and escape the narrow and boring island of Rokkenjima...? `
`Now, I'll make that dream a reality for you.`
` Because I only want to share this joy with you, and no one else...!`
`"Ahhahaha ahhahahahaha!! `
`It's so fun, Rosa, it's so fun!! `
`" `
`Take a look, below you!`
` Look at how small our mansion is.`
` I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small.`
` ...Now I'm especially shocked at how narrow and tiny it is.`
` So feel.`
` Enjoy.`
` Rejoice...!`
` That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will!`
` Come on, let's dance, Rosa!`
` Through the rain, through the wind!`
` Let's fly around like we're dancing! `
`The lightning will shine on us and bless us!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind.`
` As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground.`
`...However, it was only that way for the witch.`
` Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over.`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!! `
`Forgive meeeeee, let me doooooooown!!"`
`"......You're right, it's more fitting for humans to crawl on the ground.`
` Then why not go back there?"`
`A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch's face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared.`
` Then, she decided to listen to her former sister's request.`
`"............?! `
`.........Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped.`
` In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a human.`
`......Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside-down.`
` No, she began to fall.`
`"Oops... `
`That's right, if I don't take her down the right way, this is what happens!"`
`The witch hadn't intended to send Rosa plummeting.`
` But she still wasn't used to using magic.`
` After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush,`
` as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly.`
` But the witch hadn't intended to kill her.`
` So she wished that Rosa didn't die.`
` When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa's body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished.`
` Rosa's body, which should have been spread out like a carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal.`
` The broken and crushed bones returned to normal.`
` The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal.`
`......How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them...`
` Anyone can take a life.`
` But no human can revive a lost life!`
` By surpassing the irreversable, one proves that they have surpassed humans.`
`......This surely gave her a much, much greater realization that she was a witch than flying through the sky had.`
`".........Awesome... `
`I can even revive, ......an ended life......!"`
`"Of course.`
` Beatrice-sama is the Endless Witch. `
`......To live and to die.`
` To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly.`
` Beatrice-sama, the Endless Witch, is the queen who controls the cycle of life and death."`
`"Ahaha, aha.`
` One time, I dropped a fishbowl.`
` The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn't put it back together again.`
` I would never see that cute pop-eyed goldfish swim again after it landed on the floor.`
`.........No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived.`
`...At that time, I learned something.`
` You must not break things, you must not kill people. `
`After all, you can't fix them!!"`
`"So, if you can fix them, `
`......then you won't get in trouble for breaking them, right...?`
` Haha, ahahahaha, .........awesome...`
` Awesome, awesome, awesome...!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahaahahahahahahaahhahahhahhahhahhaha!!"`
`For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had succeeded was.`
` Her laugh was pure, innocent, and also cruel.`
`".........Uuuuuu, ......au......"`
`Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall.`
` At that point, the witch landed and held out her hand.`
`"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa.`
` I didn't think flying in the sky would be so much fun.`
` Sorry, I'm really sorry.`
` And I didn't know that humans could die so easily.`
` But I've brought you back to life, so we're even.`
` So get up, okay?`
` Play with me some more, okay? `
`*giggle*giggle*, ehehehaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...?`
` Go ahead and tell me about all of them without holding back.`
` As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...! `
`Even making you fall into a sea of jelly!`
` Even having you get sucked into a mountain of cake!`
` I can even even make you sprout butterfly wings and let you walk around the garden, okay?! `
`I'll do them one after another. Let's start with the ocean of jelly, okay...?!`
`"S, stop it, `
`............urgg!!"`
`Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky.`
` However, the sky wasn't filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice.`
` When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes.`
` The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel-colored jigsaw puzzle.`
`......It was from the dream she had talked about when she was young, an ocean of jelly.`
` The black part was coffee jelly. `
`The red was strawberry, `
`the yellow was pineapple, `
`the green was melon.`
` What was the white part, apple...?`
`.........Did Rosa even have the time to think something like that? `
`Rosa fell towards that multi-colored ocean.`
`......And sunk deep into the purple grape-flavored ocean.`
` It really was an ocean of jelly.`
` It had no bottom.`
` As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean.`
` They were probably made of grape skin.`
` Then she sunk on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Marianas Trench,`
` ......crushed by the water pressure of the jelly ocean, `
`as her ribs snapped, as her spine snapped.`
`...In the end, she had become a small, frail meatball.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`What a truly wonderful experience, to drown to death in an ocean of jelly...!!`
` It's a dream no one else can imitate!!`
` I have made it come true for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!"`
`The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky.`
` And after being wrapped up in a golden sparkle, she returned to her original form.`
` It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it.`
` If they were a witch! `
`That absent-minded look on Rosa's face `
`has to be because of the joy from having that dream she had given up on as a child made into reality.`
` Definitely. Probably.`
` Next is the mountain of cake.`
` In an instant, the sky was covered, and became black and white in the shape of a chessboard.`
` That almost transparent white part was her favorite rare cheesecake.`
` The elegant black part was a slightly bitter Gateau au chocolat.`
` That became the ceiling, became a mountain, ......several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa.`
` If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Mount Everest.`
` So they probably weighed,`
` .........I'm not too sure, but it was probably heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together.`
` It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up, `
`......so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death.`
` In less than a second, `
`her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out, `
`*squish*pop*slop*.`
` Even so, an even greater number of cakes piled up on top,`
` ...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between the cakes.`
` She became as thick as a single hair, and was probably smashed out into the area of a tennis court.`
` That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a gold flash.`
` Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again.`
`......Of course, it definitely wasn't a dream.`
` She had been revived after dying.`
` By that point, death, which most humans only have to experience once after they are born,`
` had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa.`
` In other words, she gone through that which humans cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?!`
` Next is the butterflies, look...!!"`
`"P, please, have mercy......, .........aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"No wa-y!`
` Let's play more, let's play more...!! `
`Kyahihihihahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy.`
` When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink.`
` She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly.`
` Then, gold wings sprouted from her back..., and she joined her fellow gold butterflies.`
` However, while a human body could withstand that wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly's body.`
` The gold butterfly Rosa was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden.`
`"No, ...nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`.........ah..."`
`As her dance wore her out, she was caught by a gentle bed.`
` It was the soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor.`
`...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on the night of the storm...`
` That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand,`
` now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Kyahhahahakyahhahahahahaha! `
`What a klutz, you got caught in a spider's web!`
` Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!! `
`This time, it's a dance with a spider.`
` That takes me back. Remember the times we'd find a spider's web and play around by throwing pebbles at it?`
` I've heard that spiders don't chew their prey, `
`but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck it out.`
`......Hey, Rosa, remember?`
` Remember how we'd throw butterflies into the spider's web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack? `
`Kyahhahahahahahaha, `
`you don't remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!!`
` Make sure you watch closely this time, okay?`
` Very closely. `
`Kyahihihahahahahahakya-hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, `
`have mercy, Nee-san, `
`help me, Nee-san!! `
`" `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk`
`gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh`
`errrrrrrrrkkk`
`bwaagh`
`ahggggg`
`ergorblahgehmolgeeaaarg ga, `
`ga..., `
`ga......, `
`gyuuboh!!"`
`"This girl's not bad. She truly can use magic at will! `
`Hiihyahhahahahahakkuhihiehiehyahyahya!! `
`Interesting interesting, interesting interesting!`
` You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!"`
`"Don't fuck with me!!! `
`Stop it alreadyyyyyyyyyy!!`
` What's so fun, you're insane, you're insane!!!`
` What's so fun about doing something like this?!?!"`
`"Doesn't that just look so fun?`
` What do you expect, magic is fun!!`
` I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around a lot!`
` ...Aaah, I understand, I understand, I understand that play from the bottom of my heart!`
`......Looks like I won't be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler. Aah, what a shame, what a shame!!`
` If you accept me, I'll teach you magic anytime you want, see?!`
` It's hard to describe the joy you receive in the instant you are freed from the shackles of humanity! `
`I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion!`
` I de-finitely would like to see the world of magic you would give birth to, just once! `
`Kihhihihihhihhi, hyahhyahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Isn't this starting to get fun?`
` You've started wanting to use magic, haven't you?!`
` It's pretty fun to be a witch, isn't it?!`
` Just for you, I'll teach everything!`
` About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea! `
`I want to teach you of the passion that starts the instant you surpass the bounds of humans `
`and see how wide your world stretches!`
` Wouldn't that be fun, `
`wahhyahhyahahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`There was no malice in Beato's expression.`
`...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show.`
` And she wanted to share that appreciation with Battler.`
`......Battler was shocked by that hopelessly `
`different measure of value.`
`"You're insane!!`
` Stop it already, damn iiiiiiiiit!!`
` Virgilia, let me stop this insane farce!!`
` What should I do!!"`
`".........We exist outside the board.`
` We cannot touch the board itself."`
`Virgilia shook her head apologetically.`
`...Her body had already been 'killed'.`
` Did that mean she couldn't interfere in any way...? `
`As Beatrice continued to look interested in an insane sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her.`
`"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!! `
`Quit messing around, you witch!!`
` Are you trying to tell me that's Eva oba-san?! `
`That's impossible!! `
`While the Eva oba-san I know may be a bit mean at times,`
` it's completely impossible that she's the kind of person that would do something this cruel!! `
`This is all part of your deception!!`
` Don't toy with Rosa oba-san!!`
` Don't toy with Eva oba-san!!`
` Stop this farce right nooooooooooooooooow!!"`
`"I told you, I'm not the one playing with Rosa anymore.`
` I told you, that's the new Beatrice.`
` Is it really so cruel that you have to squeal like that?`
` You're also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren't you?!`
` You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and, `
`.........ouch! `
`Wh, what are you doing..."`
`For the first time, Battler slapped Beato's cheek.`
`...Beatrice didn't know why he had done something like that to her, and a surprised expression rose to her face.`
` Battler especially couldn't forgive that expression, and he roared.`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh?! `
`This is interesting?!`
` What's wrong with your head?!!`
` Die! `
`Try and slice your head up into pieces and look inside, you'll definitely find that the insides have been completely removed!!!`
` Stop it right now, stop this disgusting farce!!`
` I won't forgive you!!`
` How could you do something so cruel!!`
` I've sometimes thought that you were a bit of a funny person, but I'll never make that mistake again!`
` You're just a monster who's always cruel!!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Never again!!`
` I won't accept you, I won't talk with you, I don't even want to look at your face!!`
` Did you hear me?!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me.`
` DISAPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAARRR!!!"`
`The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall and knocked Beato back onto her butt.`
`"......Owowowow...`
`...What are you talking about, isn't it an interesting show...?"`
`She spoke as though making an excuse, but the person those words were directed at, Battler, was no longer there.`
` His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness...`
`...But Beatrice looked displeased, and continued trying to explain herself.`
`"......I, it's not like I completely don't see where you're coming from,`
` ...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, right...?`
` No matter how she kills, that person will be brought back to life in the end, right?`
` ...Aren't humans creatures that are fine with anything as long as it ends well......?! `
`H, hey, Teacher.`
` It's nothing to get so angry about, is it...?!"`
`She was hoping for approval, but Virgilia simply faced her with an indifferent expression.`
`...To Beato, at that moment, even a surprised face would probably have seemed better.`
`"............I have nothing in particular to say.`
` If you think it is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want.`
` ...Call me when it's finished.`
` I will erase my form until then."`
`Following Battler's lead, Virgilia hid herself in the darkness...`
` Beato, who was now completely isolated, didn't have a clue what was going on, feeling that they were making her out to be the bad guy.`
`".....................`
`......What's wro-ng?`
` Isn't it an interesting show...?!`
` I, it might be a little vulgar, ......but it's fairly interesting, isn't it...?!!`
` He-y, Ronove...?!`
` It's nothing to get so mad about, right...?!`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` ......Something interesting for you, Milady, is not necessarily interesting for Battler-sama."`
`"Does he really, ...hate me that much? `
`......Well, certainly, we are enemies and opponents in this competition, `
`...but is our relationship really so bad that we can't laugh together at this entertainment...?!`
` .........Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him...`
`......Does he really reject me so much that we can't even do that...?`
`...He doesn't have to accept that I'm a witch.`
` Because we're challenging each other in this game. `
`But still, saying he won't look at my face, that he won't talk to me,`
` ......he'll probably do all he can to ignore me...`
` Am I really hated that muuuuuch......!"`
`"Up until this point, you have advanced several moves that would make you hated, Milady.`
` Even a demon such as myself can slightly understand Battler-sama's feelings.`
`......I wonder if you cannot understand that because you are especially thickheaded, Milady?`
` Pu kukukukuku."`
`"Sh, shut up shut up shut up shut up!!`
` Why don't you disappear too?!!"`
`"Yes, certainly.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beatrice was left alone.`
` The only one in the rainy rose garden.`
` A lonely witch who no one would play with.`
` Because no one would play with her, she was a lonely witch.`
`"............`
`......What's going on?`
` ...Why won't anyone play with me...? `
`.........Am I really that weird, that cruel...?`
` ............Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha, isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun! `
`Hey, how should we play next?`
` Of course, we should play with Maria too, right? `
`Let's all have a friendly walk together, okay?`
` Let's swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let's have a picnic in a cake-rising oven! `
`Ahahaha, akyakyakyakyakyakya!!"`
`".........H, hey, new Beatrice."`
`Behind the witch that was continuing her mad banquet, Beato showed herself.`
`...That expression was very rare for her.`
` It was kind of restrained, unreliable, miserable.`
`"Oh, it's the predecessor Beatrice-sama.`
` Were you watching? `
`The power of magic is truly wonderful!`
` Until now, I had never thought it would be so fun to be reborn as a witch.`
` It's like playtime that never ends...!`
` Come on, let's play together, Predecessor-sama...!! `
`But first, wait for a second, okay?!`
` The two of them were cooked to death in the oven, so I have to revive them again! `
`They're like bread rising because of yeast!`
` Like cookies expanding in an oven! `
`Kyakkyakkyakkya!!"`
`"L, listen to what I'm saying...`
`......Umm, well, `
`isn't that enough for the sacrifice of the second twilight?`
` ...Of course, it isn't specified how you kill them, but,`
` umm, `
`......maybe you shouldn't toy with them any more than that..."`
`"What are you saying, Predecessor-sama?`
` I heard from Ronove a short while ago.`
` Wasn't your magic much, much more wonderful, cruel, and insane! `
`That Halloween party where candies poured out of six people's stomachs was truly wonderful!`
` So maybe I'll act out Alice's tea party...!`
` I'll invite everyone to a tea party in celebration of a completely pointless day, and entertain them one by one with my magic! `
`I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you? `
`I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?! `
`Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren't they?`
` Now that I'm a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand. `
`Kyahhahahahakukyahyafuhyahahahahaha!!"`
`"............I have also, umm, `
`...sometimes thought that, in the past, `
`...I might have gone a little too far. `
`......Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it's a good idea to have a little elegance..."`
`"............???`
` I don't get what you're saying, Predecessor-sama. `
`But there's one thing I do understand.`
` No matter how hard I try now, I'm no match for how cruel you are.`
` I've gotta try much, much harder.`
` I've gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!"`
`"L, like I said, you've already done enough here...!`
` A, anyway, this is my, your predecessor's order.`
` That's enough for the second twilight. `
`I'll show you how it's done.`
` Stand back and watch..."`
`"Yes, Predecessor-sama.`
` I can't wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you use."`
`The new witch grasped the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow,`
` stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face.`
`......She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself.`
`"............Well, speaking of that...`
` You're only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that.`
` ...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..."`
`When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria.`
`......Compared to how the new Beatrice had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler.`
`...It was probably gentler that how Beato had done it herself up until now.`
` Rosa's consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths.`
`...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared...`
`"......Please......have mercy......`
`...Even, ......if it's just Maria......have mercy......"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`".........Sorry.`
` My disciple just, umm, ...acted without restraint for a bit. `
`...Umm, `
`.........forgive me."`
`"B, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaahh, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`When Maria realized it was the real Beatrice, she jumped onto her.`
`"...You promised, right, Beato?!`
` You promised that you would take Maria to the Golden Land, right?!`
` There, would be friendly with Mama, and everyone would laugh together...!`
` You promised that you would take us there, right?!"`
`".........A, `
`...about that.`
` ...I can no longer, `
`...keep that promise.`
` .........Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle, `
`......I am no longer the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`......So, sorry.`
` ...I can no longer keep my promise with you......"`
`"Why...?`
` Why...?`
` Beato promised..."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` ...I'm truly sorry...`
`.........So at least, in apology for not being able to keep my promise..."`
`............It truly is quiet.`
` And I'll give you a sleep that will never be troubled again...`
` Maria was embraced by the loving expression on Beato's face...`
` Then, .........softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria's neck.`
` It was a very gentle bruise.`
`...It's redness grew bit by bit, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand...`
`......Maria's neck tilted suddenly.`
`...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep.`
`"M, Maria......`
`...Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"......Sorry.`
` ......I won't apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` That is simply your fate. `
`However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices...`
`...This is your final sleep.`
` ...Never again will it be disturbed..."`
`Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose.`
`...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa's body dance lightly like a feather.`
` Then, Rosa's body floated lightly, `
`......and there was the garden fence, with its spear-shaped prongs.`
` The spear of the fence pierced Rosa's medulla oblongata.`
`......Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow.`
` Rosa's life was snapped out.`
` Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, it seemed to be over much too fast in the end.`
`...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence.`
`...But, she had passed away.`
`".........W, ...well, something like that."`
`Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax.`
` Then, she said it out loud.`
`"It's kinda plain...`
`......Very different from the Predecessor-sama Ronove told me about."`
`"...Well, ...you must use magic with dignity, right...?`
` If it's too, umm, ...undignified, that isn't very elegant..."`
`"........................`
`......Even though you're lucky enough to have the magic to do wonderful things endlessly...`
`...Boring."`
`"Don't complain...!`
` The path of the Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day.`
` You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight...`
` For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions.`
` ...Alright......?!"`
`"........................"`
`"W, what happened to your answer?`
` Your answer...!"`
`".....................`
`............Su-re."`
`"...That is good, that is.`
` ......Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ceremony.`
` You still have to kill five people...`
` You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity, `
`...and with at least a little restraint, right...?`
` What Ronove told you about how I did it, ......that was a bad example.`
` You mustn't use that as a model.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"............Yes, Predecessor-sama."`
`"A good answer.`
` ......Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!"`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` I, Ronove, am here."`
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"...Up until this point, umm, I've done things a little flashy, but,`
` ......umm, `
`......well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important, `
`well, about that..."`
`As Ronove laughed at Beato's uncharacteristically flustered speech, `
`he summed it up for her.`
`"Certainly.`
` From now on, we will be careful to perform in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ......Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their bad behavior up until now,`
` and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner.`
` ......Would that be acceptable? Milady?"`
`"H, hmm.`
` That's it, more or less.`
` Everyone, take it to heart!`
` Alright...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"That is all I wish to say.`
` ......You may leave now."`
`"Certainly.`
` If you would excuse me."`
`"Excuse us."`
`"........................"`
`"Well, ...that's all I want to say.`
` So, take care as you continue, alright?`
` Go with dignity, and, ...umm, prudence, alright?`
` ......You should do your best.`
` I will be watching over you."`
`Acting unsure until the very end, Beato communicated only that,`
` became a group of gold butterflies, and hid her form in the empty air.`
` She didn't have any business there, so it might be fitting to say that she disappeared in a hurry.`
` After that, all that remained was Maria's corpse, lying down and pounded by the rain,`
` Rosa's corpse, propped up by the fence and staring up at the sky...`
`......And the figure of the witch.`
`"..................Have prudence......, ......you say..."`
`Her expression looked just a little bored.`
` There was a popping sound.`
`...That was probably her clicking her tongue.`
`".................................`
`........................What a boring person."`
`Leaving that last sentence behind, she once again hid her form in the empty air......`
