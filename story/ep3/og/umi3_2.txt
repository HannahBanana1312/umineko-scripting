`"...Six years ago, you say?`
` Anyway, back then I was still in elementary school, right?`
` It's pretty unfair to force me to remember, don't you think?"`
`"That's right.`
` Especially since we were so young, we've grown a lot in these six years.`
` I was surprised. If I hadn't been introduced, I wouldn't even have remembered you."`
`"Really?`
` I knew it was Battler right away.`
` After he opened his mouth, I was sure."`
`"Uu-.`
` Maria met him for the first time.`
` Six years ago, didn't know him."`
`"That's right.`
` Maria-sama was only three years old."`
`"When you say it like that, I'm the same.`
` I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she's grown so big, I didn't recognize her."`
`After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk and take it easy enjoying ourselves.`
` It had seemed that our parents were having a suspicious, complicated discussion, so we had decided to leave our seats.`
`...Just as you'd expect, since it had been six years, the conversation focused on me.`
`"Still, you've really gotten taller.`
` I won't call myself short, but anyway, your height surprised me."`
`"That's right. I remember well what Battler-sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so."`
`"Don'tcha think?`
` I couldn't even imagine that this was the same Battler as six years ago."`
`"I'm surprised at how everyone remembers so much about six years ago.`
` My memory's all hazy."`
`"No surprise.`
` You'll remember about us, it just might take a little time. `
`Should I feel a little hurt?"`
`"Wait, this was six years ago, right?`
` I'm the one who has it bad, being forced to remember...!"`
`"...Are you saying that you can't remember well because it was six years ago? `
`I can remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday..."`
`"That's because your memory is good, Shannon. `
`You really do remember what kind of things Battler did and said, don't you?"`
`"Come to think of it, that's right.`
` Shannon's memory is surprisingly good."`
`"Uu-.`
` Maria's horrible at remembering.`
` Remembers fun things well but horrible at boring things.`
` Uu-."`
`We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that.`
`"Shannon.`
` By the way, what was Battler like six years ago? `
`Remember any interesting episodes?"`
`"Let's see. `
`......I'm sure that he said something like this when he left. `
`'I'll be back, {c:86EF9C:<see you again>}. `
`I'll come to greet you riding on a white horse.'"`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, `
`Stop iiiiiiiiit, so embarassiiiiiiiiiiing!!"`
`"Gyaaah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!! `
`Sounds just like something you would say!`
` I remember, I remember that you always used to be full of those stupid lines, Battler! `
`Waaah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!"`
`"Hah-hah-hah-ha.`
` It really does sound like something Battler-kun would have said back then."`
`"Uu-.`
` Embarrassing? Embarrassing?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` Horribly embarrassing... `
`Maria, I'm sure that when you are in middle school, you'll want to say embarrassing things like that...`
` When that happens, write it on the back of some leaflet, and read it three times before you say it out loud.`
` If you don't, you'll definitely regret it...`
` Still, everyone has to pass through that pitiful period...`
` That's right, that's how you know your place, learn shame, and become an adult. `
`That's right, this is a memory I want to disappear, the bittersweet kind of thing that everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults...`
` Aaaaarrggh..."`
`Anyway, it was just something I'd let slip out without thinking, so I hadn't remembered exactly what I had said.`
` But when those words were recited to me, it was all so embarrassing.`
` Recently, I had finally come to understand this weakness, and had worked hard to refrain from such careless outbursts......`
`...It looked like I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there was nothing I could do about it.`
`"Shanno~n, do you remember any other embarrassing things?"`
`"Yeah, well... I remember various other things, but...`
`......since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I will refrain from saying any more..."`
`"I don't remember anything about what I said off the top of my head.`
` Please, don't make me remembe-r."`
`"...Uu-.`
` Shannon's bullying Battler...? `
`Uu-.`
` You can't.`
` You shouldn't bully people."`
`"Hahahahaha. She isn't really bullying him.`
` Let's leave it at that, okay? `
`But Shannon, you'll have tell me all about it sometime Battler isn't around. `
`It sounds pretty interesting."`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`"N, no, you can't, Shannon-chaaaaaaaaaan...!!"`
`For a while, George-aniki laughed at me, as though warming up for when Shannon-chan would tell him about more of my embarrassing misspeaks.`
` George looked like he was flirting with Shannon,`
` ......but he seemed somewhat open and frank.`
` He was always frank with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants.`
`...When I thought about it, I got the feeling that it was a little familiar, which seemed slightly weird.`
` Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick, and George-aniki and Shannon-chan joined in.`
` This left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively.`
`"......Hey, Jessica.`
` Is George-aniki, ......umm, going out with Shannon-chan?"`
`"Ooooh?`
` What the, how did you notice?! `
`Battler, you're really good at seeing through people."`
`"Huh, ...whaaaaaaah?! `
`I was just kidding, ... but they're actually going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Your voice is too loud! `
`...It looks like they're keeping it secret for now, alright?`
` It'd be better if nobody, especially Eva oba-san, heard about it."`
`"I, I see...`
` Love with a servant... `
`...Y, yeah but, since when?`
` Wo-w, a lot can happen in six years......`
` But still, Aniki really is talented, and Shannon-chan is kind and brave, `
`......they might be a pretty good match."`
`Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit.`
` I see, she really fits well with George-aniki, nothing I can do about that.`
` ...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago...`
`.........Which means that, the collection of my embarrassing lines that Shannon-chan had just held back on,`
` ......probably had something to do with that...`
` Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can't take it...`
`"How long have they been going out?"`
`"That depends on what you call going out, but I think it's been at least a year. `
`But if you count the time spent when they both had one-sided feelings, it would probably be several years."`
`Before I'd realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group, and were walking down the beach, talking about something.`
`......They looked calm, `
`and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious relationship, as though they were already engaged.`
`"......Six years ago...`
` That's a long time. `
`What did these six years mean to me?`
` I've just gotten taller.`
` It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad."`
`"What about you, Battler?`
` Have you gotten a girlfrie-nd?"`
`"Hmm, I wonder.`
` There's a lot of girls that I play with.`
` But there is no 'only one'. `
`......I'm just like a kid.`
` I think it's more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person."`
`"Aah, that's so you, Battler.`
` But take your relationships with your female friends seriously. `
`A community of girls with the wrong impressions can be scary.`
` They could have some secret feud behind your back, and hurt someone or make them cry without you noticing it, right?"`
`"That's so weird.`
` I think I got the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week.`
` ......What did she say?`
` Why not have fun together with everyone?`
` Did they really want to hook up with me that much?"`
`"...It's probably because you have never had a partner like that, Battler.`
` Well, you might run into girls like that every once in a while.`
` You just have to wait patiently!"`
`"What?`
` It sounds almost like you've already found a partner like that.`
` What about you?`
` Have you gotten a boyfriend?"`
`"Huh?!`
` M, me?!`
` No, err, wahahahahaha......"`
`"Come on, that reaction's so easy to understand...`
` From the looks of it, there's some boy who you're thinking about, but you haven't been able to confess that to them yet, something like that."`
`"N, no, umm, that's not, umm, uh!`
` Sh, shut up, who cares about that...!"`
`"Even though you're the one who brought up this subject, why do you have to betray me like this?`
` Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet, they almost never answer them.`
` What cruel creatures, seriously."`
`"......W, well, umm.`
` ...I did try, `
`...to confess once.`
` Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly."`
`"Did they say sorry?"`
`"No, umm, ......`
`...well, umm, it was really one-sided and I got confused, I guess...`
` It was like they didn't view me that way."`
`"I can understand that.`
` You talk just like a man.`
` If you don't act a little more elegant, you won't be able to entice a man's heart, right?"`
`"I, i, is it really, `
`......is the way I speak, `
`...really that bad?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Well, umm, how you talk isn't everything, but to people like you, who usually talk badly,`
` if you quickly try to start talking seriously, umm, that might start really get some guys' hearts thumping."`
`"R, really...?`
` I see......, `
`......yeah..."`
`As Jessica thought about suddenly speaking meekly, she blushed faintly.`
`...I see, even though her confession didn't go well, it looks like she still hasn't given up.`
` But still, I understood.`
` After seeing how close George-aniki and Shannon-chan had gotten, I also kinda wanted to find a girlfriend.`
` Six years.`
` ...Six years of puberty are pretty important, and they had gone by pretty fast.`
` As the typhoon approached, the clouds grew steadily grayer, and yet, even so, I had this really refreshing feeling.`
`...Maybe I'll start thinking about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs...`
`"By the way,`
` I know George-aniki is going out with a servant, Shannon-chan. `
`......Could it be that you are the same, Jessica?"`
`"Huh, ...eeeeeeh?!?! `
`W, w, w, w, why do you think that...?!"`
`"Come to think of it, that young kid Kanon-kun, who greeted us in the rose garden... `
`You really covered for him since he's bad at talking, right Jessica?"`
`"N, no, that's not...`
` Wahahahaha, you're too suspicious...!!"`
`"Then tell me just this one thing.`
` Right now,`
` is the boy you're after somewhere within one kilometer?"`
`"W, well about that, umm, ...I, I, I wonder..."`
`Kanon-kun was the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend.`
` So judging by her reaction, I was right on.`
` I didn't think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, ...but love with a servant...`
` I wouldn't have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me...`
` Eva oba-san would probably become an obstacle to George-aniki and Shannon-chan's love.`
` If Eva oba-san learned that the partner of her only beloved son was Shannon-chan,`
` she would probably scream at her, as though a servant was the same as a cat who had snuck in.`
` And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon-kun would probably be just as full of difficulties.`
` Natsuhi oba-san was also very strict about that kind of thing.`
`......Anyway, Jessica's husband would probably become the head of the Ushiromiya family in the future.`
` If that person had once been a servant working for the family, ......well, things would get complicated.`
`"Well, who you love depends on the person.`
` Isn't everything fine as long as it's someone who's fun to be with? `
`Being with someone doesn't require any permission as long as the two people accept each other.`
` If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose.`
` Don't forget that.`
` You can't go out with someone with incomplete feelings."`
`"...Heh...`
` I can't believe you're saying something so philosophical-sounding when you haven't even been in love."`
`"Don't treat love like a matter of profit and loss.`
` It's about heart.`
` That's all I want to say.`
` Well then, `
`<see you again, have a nice day>."`
`"......Hu, `
`...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`George nii-san, Shanno~n, listen, liste-n!`
` This guy, he's said another one of those lines!!"`
`"I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything!!`
` Waaah, don't make fun of me, don't make fun of me!!"`
`"Maria heard it, Maria heard it!`
` <See you aga~in>, <see you aga~in>!!"`
`For a while, we forgot that the wind was getting stronger, and played around on the beach.`
`......I had grown a lot these last six years, and being able to celebrate my youth and meet with all of my cousins was truly refreshing.`
`......It was a little late now, but I realized that I should have gotten back together with everyone a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family...`
`"It sure is nice to have all the cousins together every once in a while..."`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria also likes it when the cousins get together, it's fu-n!"`
`"That's right.`
` We're already old enough.`
` It's not like we couldn't meet each other when our parents aren't around.`
` ...It might not be a bad idea to gather the cousins together and play every once in a while."`
`"That's a good plan.`
` Maybe we should set up something like that the next time we get a chance."`
`"I agree.`
` I'd like to be friendly with my cousins all the time."`
`"Hey, hey, if you stress the point that much, doesn't that make it sound like relatives normally don't get along well?"`
`"Hahahahahaha."`
`George-aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained.`
`...Did I say too much? `
`Judging by how our parents made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe that was something I shouldn't have said.`
`"...That's right.`
` Just like Jessica said.`
` Let's always be friendly to each other."`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria too!`
` Everyone friendly!!"`
`"That's right.`
` Yeah.`
` We'll always be together.`
` We'll always be friendly."`
`"Heheh.`
` Man, we've been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff.`
` I feel kinda awkward."`
`"But I think that is very important.`
` It's very hard for people to always be together, to always be friendly unless they desire it."`
`"That's right.`
` You really can't take everyone being friendly for granted."`
`"Uu-.`
` A witch that I know said it.`
` Happiness, if everyone doesn't believe in it, won't be granted."`
`"That's true.`
` Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief.`
` If we all believe in that, I'm sure it will bring us happiness."`
`"Alright.`
` Now the next embarrassing thing.`
` Let's all swear to believe together, alright?`
` That we'll all always be friendly, that we'll always be happy."`
`As if we could become like our parents.`
` As if we'd ever search for each other's weaknesses, going after Grandfather's fortune...`
`"Alright!`
` We'll always be friendly and happy.`
` And let's all believe that."`
`As all of us cousins were trying nostalgically to have fun, dark clouds approached Rokkenjima.`
`......I wonder if the typhoon will pass and show us the refreshing sky before we leave this island.`
` Who cares about what our parents expect? `
`Who cares about the inheritance and the honor of our old family? `
`As youthful as we were, we were renewing our old friendship.`
` And we all believed together that we could all be happy.`
` Therefore..., `
`I wanted this day to end, `
`without anything weird occurring, `
`in peace and happiness, `
`calmly...`
` No, ...I didn't just want it to end.`
`......Please, let it end......!`
`"Let it eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennd? `
`Kyah-hahah-hah-hah-hahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit!!`
` Don't show up, don't appear!!`
` Damndamndaaamn!!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've finally made preparations for a new game. `
`Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy!`
` Come to me, winds, rain, typhoon!`
` Cut this island off from the real world!!`
` Throw Rokkenjima into another world, into the spirit world, into a world of fantasy!"`
`And so, the tale repeated for the third time.`
` However, to an Endless Witch, `
`what did it matter whether it was the first, second, or third time? `
`It probably didn't matter at all.`
` After all, this was a tale of fantasy, endlessly repeating until the match was settled. Would Battler surrender first, or would the witch? `
`Then the sky grew dark and cloudy, the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon...`
` And Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling,`
` going around in circles, searching for that single rose which should have been marked......`
`".........Not here...`
` Not here......`
` We marked it, `
`......Maria's rose isn't here...`
`......uu-.`
` ............Uu-!!"`
`Maria definitely remembered it.`
` That rose had been in the flower bed right here.`
` And yet, it wasn't anymore.`
` She didn't know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something which should have been there,`
` and, moaning bitterly, she couldn't help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot.`
` She was acting almost as though she would be able to see it if she looked at a different angle,`
` but even though she did that, there was no way to find something that wasn't there...`
` The wind grew increasingly stronger, and the rain turned into cold, large drops.`
` There was no way Maria could ignore this.`
` However, if she couldn't find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever.`
`...Maria believed that.`
` That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she shouldn't be able to find...`
` Just then, the cold drops of rain that were tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked.`
`"...............Uu-?"`
`Maria raised her head.`
`...When she did, she saw that an umbrella was opened there, protecting her from the rain...`
` And the one holding out that umbrella was, `
`.........the witch she admired, Beatrice.`
`"Beatrice...!!"`
`"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain?`
` You could catch a cold like this.`
` Even witches have to care for their own health."`
`"Maria, `
`...can't find..., `
`her rose...`
` ......uu-.`
` No matter how many times she searches, `
`......even though it should have been here, `
`...can't find it..."`
`Maria told Beatrice about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose,`
` and that she was sure they had marked it.`
`"Hoho.`
` So you can't find it. `
`.........If you are a witch's apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose.`
` I believe that searching with just your eyes won't be nearly enough."`
`"......Uu-.`
` ......Can't find it.`
` ...Maria's done her best, and tried to search with magic, but can't find it..."`
`"I think that practicing your magic is a very good thing, but it might be a little too much for you with all of this wind and rain. `
`......Allow me to lend you some special power.`
` Being concerned for their disciples is also one of the duties of a teacher."`
`"Th, ...thank you-.`
` Beatrice!!"`
`Maria's face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin.`
` Maria knew.`
` She knew that there was nothing Beatrice's magic couldn't do.`
` So she was sure that Beatrice would be able to find the rose easily, even though Maria couldn't...`
` Beatrice closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain.`
` Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke.`
`"............Hmm.`
` All things in this world are transitory.`
` Too bad, Maria.`
` ...It seems that your rose couldn't withstand all of this wind and rain."`
`"Uu-......`
` Then, Maria's rose.........?"`
`"It was uprooted by the wind, and is no longer of this world."`
`"...............Uu-......"`
`What Beatrice had said was quite appropriate.`
`...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind.`
`...However, Maria couldn't accept this, and bitterly gave a low-pitched moan...`
`"............No."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"......No no no!`
` Maria's rose!!`
` Maria's rose won't come back, no!`
` Maria will bring it back to life with her magic. `
`Beatrice, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!"`
`"Ha!`
` It's much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic.`
` Know your place."`
`"...............Uuuuuu."`
`Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret.`
` Beatrice shrugged her shoulders and laughed at the pity that Maria's expression invited.`
`"Very well.`
` I will lend you power for the hidden art that can revive a rose."`
`"Really?!"`
`"Hmm.`
` ......Well then, concentrate the power of your heart.`
` Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart."`
`"......Uu-."`
`Maria closed her eyes.`
` Then, she repeated Beatrice's song-like words...`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have?"`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have...?"`
`"Don't look.`
` Don't listen.`
` And believe.`
` ......Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it.`
` ............That's it.`
` ......Good..."`
`Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance.`
` ......Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held?`
`"Lost soul of the rose.`
` Gather into one, and remember your form.`
` ......Come, gather, remember..."`
`The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased. Then, Beatrice raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger...`
` This was the miracle of the golden magic...`
` And the gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold.`
` ......It was a single seed, glittering gold.`
` It rode on the tip of Beatrice's finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf.`
` It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily...`
`...Maria, who admired magic and the witch, really wanted to see this fantastical sight.`
` However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it.`
`...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power that she had concentrated in her heart would be interrupted, and the magic would be lost.`
` Therefore, Beatrice, as the only witch permitted to lay eyes on the golden miracle,`
` was the master of these many miracles...`
` Then, the fully grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower.`
` And when Beatrice poked it with her finger in just the right way,`
` the gold-colored sparkle scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose.`
`"...Hmm.`
` It looks like you've remembered a splendid rose. `
`......However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won't be able to tell it apart.`
` Shall I perform one last service?"`
`Beatrice, for the sake of her cute apprentice witch who was moaning even more now in concentration, `
`decided to use one more bit of magic.`
` When she snapped her fingers, a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived.`
` Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose...`
`"That is sufficient.`
` ......Maria.`
` You may open your eyes now."`
`".........Uu-?`
` Where's the rose?`
` Not here.`
` Not here."`
`"Not over there, over here.`
` ...Look.`
` I've marked it with golden lace."`
`"Wah..., you did...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!!`
` Maria wants to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like Beato!!"`
`"And you can.`
` Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level."`
`Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy.`
`...Watching that, Beatrice also smiled, looking fairly pleased.`
` Now, if I tried, I could break and repair any soul, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I pleased.`
` So, the barrier created by the storm had closed Rokkenjima off from the real world.`
` Now was the time for Golden Witch Beatrice to descend, as an Endless Witch.`
` Beatrice pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One-winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria.`
` Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch's messenger.`
`"So, Kinzo.`
` I've come to join in on your fun once again...`
` My preparations are already complete.`
` What about you?`
` Have you prepared enough coins to bet in tonight's game...?"`
`"Of course. I'm fully prepared, Beatrice...!!`
` I've prepared plenty of pieces.`
` I am ready both physically and mentally! `
`So, let us make the ante.`
` All that you have given should be returned to you in the end. `
`Come, take it!!"`
`After Kinzo flung the window of his study wide open, he took off the valuable golden ring which had been on his finger,`
` and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain...`
` That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared.`
` Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly.`
`"I don't feel like losing.`
` You are mine.`
` Forever!!"`
`The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly, and fluttered around in the wind and rain.`
` It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there.`
` It then found the figure of the Golden Witch, and fluttered down......`
` When it came down right in front of Beatrice,`
` it burst open, and returned to its original form of a ring, flying through the air.`
` The way it was going, you'd have thought that it would fall into a puddle of water, but it stopped suddenly in midair.`
`...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it.`
` Somehow, this seemed unexpected even to Beatrice.`
` However, she realized what, ...who it was, and grinned broadly at it.`
` As she did, the shadow of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear...`
` It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler's uniform embroidered with the One-winged Eagle crest...`
` There was no man like this among the servants who served the Ushiromiya family.`
` Even so, Beatrice laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly.`
`"Ronove, is it.`
` ......It's been quite some time.`
` It seems that you have remembered me.`
` You were always a man who was serious about loyalty."`
`"It has been a very long time since you last corresponded...`
` There hasn't been a single day that I, Ronove, have forgotten that I serve you, Milady.`
` I was more fearful that Milady had forgotten about me.`
` In any event, Milady is quite forgetful."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I see, yes, I do forget easily.`
` I couldn't even remember your sarcasm until I heard it again."`
`"Milady, here."`
`With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully,`
` and held out to Beatrice the Head's Ring that he had just caught.`
`"It is the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` It is now once again in the possession of its Master."`
`"Hmm.`
` A proclamation from Kinzo to start the game.`
` Of course I'll receive it."`
`"So, how shall we play tonight?`
` Shall I prepare the roulette immediately?`
` Or shall I prepare some black tea first?"`
`"I can't decide which, but for now, I need you to greet someone.`
` I'm sure that guy has his mouth hanging open and can't shut it. `
`Right, Battler?"`
`"Greetings.`
` Allow me to introduce myself. `
`I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady Beatrice.`
` It is truly a pleasure to meet you."`
`"See?`
` His mouth's hanging open and he can't shut it, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Isn't that obvious, another incomprehensible guy's just appeared!! `
`Back when I was grumbling that goat-headed people would start doing the Bon dance, goat-heads started showing up in swarms,`
` and since then, not only have those seven ass nee-sans appeared, but now even a butler has shown up!!`
` It doesn't make sense, cut it out!!"`
`"By the way, Battler.`
` Did you notice?`
` Did you realize that meeting him is a true 'Devil's Proof'?"`
`"Huh, Devil's Proof, you say...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"He may not look like it, but this guy's name is amongst the 72, and he's a genuine demon.`
` In other words, I've brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Ronove holds a noble rank in hell, the 27th highest ranked great demon.`
` He's a pretty useful man.`
` I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me."`
`"It is an honor to be introduced to you. `
`While my name is amongst those of the nobles of hell,`
` I now serve as the head furniture of Beatrice-sama, the Great Witch with the standing of a vulgar human, from whom even demons can escape barefooted."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*. He's a very useful man, but he is impudent with his words.`
` It's slightly frustrating that he sometimes forgets to respect his Master."`
`"There is nothing in my contract regarding the way in which I must speak.`
` Would you like to change that contract?"`
`"It doesn't bore me, so it's fine.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Beatrice turned her back to him, cackling.`
` After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile.`
` Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake.`
`"......Wh, ...what is this supposed to be?"`
`"I am also one who has been subjected to Milady's whims.`
` In that sense, I am sure that we could become good friends.`
` This is a handshake of friendship. `
`......Of course, it doesn't mean that you will be entered into a demon's contract, so rest assured."`
`"Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of a big fight with your master.`
` I only shake hands with an enemy after we've beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out, like one of those situations in adolescent dramas.`
` Remember that."`
`"I see.`
` To shake hands with you, Battler-sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location,`
` and exchange sweet words and physical language with you that rings true to your heart.`
` When the opportunity arrives, I will prepare that location.`
` You know, I also lo-ve those kinds of situations?`
` Pu ku ku ku...!"`
`As Ronove laughed tauntingly, he whispered to Battler, bringing his face so close that their noses were almost touching.`
` Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away.`
`"Y, you're a creepy bastard...`
` I see, just right for Beato's butler..."`
`"It is an honor to receive such words of praise.`
` I'm very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time.`
` Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so please feel free to request teacakes and such."`
`"Just what I would expect from a pair of the same gender.`
` You've started to get along well very quickly. `
`I'm jealous."`
`"My, my.`
` I apologize for making you jealous, Milady.`
` I will not stealthily snatch your guest away from you.`
` Well then, I will leave for now to retake my post as head of the furniture and to greet the rest of the furniture.`
` Please forgive my short absence."`
`"Hmm.`
` Only the common goats and the seven sisters used for the ceremony have manifested themselves.`
` You will be able to finish up greeting them with ease."`
`"Oh?`
` Those lively seven sisters are here?`
` I wonder whether those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?"`
`"......Ihihi. `
`If that's graceful, I'd have to doubt the definition of graceful."`
`"Is that so?`
` It seems that those seven sisters are still playing around. `
`Judging by your expression, it seems that they are just as naughty as they were before.`
` Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as a group of those who serve Beatrice-sama.`
` What troublesome kids..."`
`"If that's your problem, don't worry.`
` They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Even you have begun to say it! `
`However, a conversation means that you accept your partner.`
` Now that you have started to respond to my idle chatting, that is proof that you are gradually starting to accept my existence."`
`"Heh.`
` That's because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, definitely definitely, never accept that you're a witch.`
` You might want to consider a slightly more positive approach, like crying and kissing my shoes."`
`Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face.`
` The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to attend to a new game, `
`and that preparations were complete...`
` After Ronove exchanged a few words with Beatrice, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into several gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It is truly pleasing when everything gets so lively. `
`......How boring were days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and without anyone to talk to..."`
`"......I get how that unpleasant guy is really fitting as your butler. `
`...But tell me.`
` Why has that butler only appeared now?`
` You said something about how only the goats and the nee-chans of the seven stakes had manifested themselves.`
` What did that mean...?"`
`"Hmm.`
` You still resist, but I am a fully-fledged witch.`
` I am in contact with several nonhuman entities in the spirit world."`
`"I'm sure.`
` No worthy people would relate with you.`
` First some goat monsters, then those ass nee-chans, and this time a demon butler's showed up.`
` ......I hate to think about it, but the way things are going, I wouldn't be surprised if even more weird people showed up..."`
`"Hah-hah-hah-ha!`
` Among the furniture that work at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think want to come over and play?`
` They will keep coming.`
` Many of them will appear.`
` When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture, and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima.`
` Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights.`
`......Of course, I also plan to invite Kinzo's family, you see?`
` You too, if you wish.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......So is this what you mean?`
` That, since you lost your power for a long time, you couldn't summon them? `
`...And then, since your magic power gradually increased, `
`you became able to summon more and more monsters, is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"It is as you say.`
` You barely stumbled at the very end, `
`but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch.`
` That wavering in your heart has slightly restored my power as a witch."`
`"So are you saying that creepy butler appeared, `
`......because I started to surrender?"`
`"That's right.`
` Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...!`
` Didn't you submit to me in the last game so much that you received all of that humiliation? `
`Wasn't it great when you had to sacrifice your back for my feet?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...D, `
`......damnit.......`
`...I thought that, as long as I didn't accept you, I'd be able to keep on going.`
` ...But apparently I was mistaken somehow."`
`"That's right.`
` The closer you get to surrendering, the more the game will swing in my favor.`
` Isn't chess the same? `
`In the process of cornering each other's kings, we trade several pieces.`
` Of course, I still haven't cornered your king."`
`"......And furthermore, you're giving it everything you've got just to help your king escape, and have lost several pieces to me, as well as a large advantage.`
` It is only natural that further advances will lean in my favor."`
`"..................Damn........."`
`From now on, you will probably be frantic as you try to avoid my checkmate.`
` ...However, as you do, I will steal your pieces from you one by one.`
` In the end, you'll have lost everything but your king, and you won't be able to escape no matter how much you try. Then you will receive a true checkmate."`
`"......You were talking big last time, weren't you?`
` Something about, since you would never accept me, that you would torment me with eternal torture.`
` Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity.`
` You haven't been capable of that since the very beginning. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!"`
`"Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you.`
` Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo-sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` ――Beatrice the Golden."`
`When Maria finished reading the letter that Beatrice had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while.`
` And then, they all broke the silence at once...`
`"R, ridiculous.`
` What a worthless, vicious prank!"`
`"Seriously.`
` There is no way that Father gave up the Head's Ring.`
` Beatrice?`
` Ha!`
` What a transparent prank, hoping to confuse us just by bringing up that name."`
`"Hey hey, who was it that filled this dessert up with a little too much punch?`
` I want to applaud and admire you, so come clean, alright?`
` Rosa?"`
`"O, of course not...!`
` I wouldn't pull a prank assuming Father's name!"`
`"Then Aneki?!`
` Aniki?!"`
`"Me?!`
` Are you an idiot?!`
` It was Nii-san, right?!`
` He could plan something this vulgar!!"`
`"Are you trying to mock me?!!`
` I'm the one who wants to question you! `
`Who is behind this ill-natured prank?!"`
`Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone.`
`...Since that included the children too, he scared most of them...`
`"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father's assets.`
` And if you think about how this family conference is all about discussing that,`
` ......I think it's too hasty to call this just a prank."`
`"I don't understand.`
` It might really be one of Father's vulgar pranks...`
` He might've planned this to shock us a bit, since we've been discussin' the distribution of his inheritance without him..."`
`"If Father was the one who planned this,`
` ......then we can't take what Maria-chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?"`
`"......That's right.`
` If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father.`
` The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it.`
` There was plenty of notice.`
` That means he was saying that the first person to solve it would be handed the inheritance along with all of his wealth, right...?"`
`......See? My magic granted your wish......`
`"It's nothing like that!! `
`It is an unshakable fact that my husband will become the next head of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"Doesn't this letter shake that!?`
` This letter is a message from the person who was given full rights to all of Father's wealth! `
`Nii-san's right to become the head has returned to a blank slate.`
` The person who solves the riddle, `
`......the person who finds Beatrice's gold will become the next head of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"Ridiculous...! `
`Do you think we can trust the meaningless words in that letter?`
` That the seal was the real thing?`
` There's no way we could trust that!!"`
`"Then let's try to go and ask Father directly!`
` We aren't at the level where you can get away with saying that his mood's bad or that he's feeling bad, right?! `
`The sealed wax clearly shows that it was from Father's representative!`
` If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii-san.`
` Show that this letter does not contain Father's will!!"`
`"V, very well.`
` It is just as you say.`
` It no longer matters whether Father's in a good mood or not... `
`Let us go up and ask him directly."`
`"Let's do it.`
` We'll ask Father directly.`
` Father is Father, why would he act in such a roundabout way?`
` Well, that is a little like Father!"`
`"I, I wonder if we should continue this discussion assuming that it is Father's letter...?"`
`"Stupid Rosa!! `
`Isn't it obviously Father's letter?!`
` That letter was Father's!!`
` Isn't it obvious that he's giving the four of us an even chance to become the next head?!! `
`Die, you brainless idiot!!"`
`Rosa really is dumb.`
` Why doesn't she just give up and die...?`
`"I, I'm sorry...!`
` Th, th, that's right..., `
`I'm sorry..."`
`In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the credibility of the letter,`
` but after just now realizing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the three siblings other than Krauss in the struggle for the inheritance, Eva had changed her position, and had claimed that the letter was authentic.`
` Rudolf and Rosa also realized that, and agreed.`
`"Seriously!!`
` How could adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...!`
` Even though I am not Father, I understand his shock!!"`
`"Whoa whoa whoa!`
` Natsuhi-san, won't everythin' be fine if we just ask Father...?!`
` Won't everything be fine if Father simply mentions that he doesn't know about the letter?"`
`"Nii-san.`
` Take responsibility, and just get him to say that he doesn't know about the letter.`
` This isn't a time to get scared just because he's in a bad mood, right?!"`
`He's still scared of Father at his age, that idiot.`
` Why doesn't he just give up and die...?`
`"Ah, aah!`
` You really are trying to paint things as black and white.`
` He's probably in the middle of eating in his study now.`
` He isn't going to put down his chopsticks for a while to talk to us...!"`
`"It's decided.`
` Let's go! `
`Kyrie, wait here for a while.`
` We'll go to check whether it's true or not and come back quickly."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I will wait patiently for Gohda-san to bring the dessert."`
`The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all stood from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter.`
` Afterwards, only the children, stunned completely speechless, Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable,`
` and Kyrie, who just shrugged, were left.`
` In the middle of all of this was Maria, who looked a little scared at the adults' sudden change.`
`...However, judging from her appearance,`
` she didn't look like she realized the full meaning of the contents of what she had just read.`
`"...What in the world, ......was that all about...?`
` I don't get it..."`
`"......They're all bastards.`
` Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!"`
`"............Everyone,`
` this is our parents' problem.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` So you mustn't worry about it."`
`"Even if you say that...`
`...they were so obvious..."`
`"I misjudged them...!`
` Showing off their greed...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` Everyone has to believe together that we'll be happy!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`"...That's right.`
` We all did promise.`
` Come on, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan, you too..."`
`"............Haah."`
`"......I feel horrible..."`
`We couldn't accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being.`
`...We had known vaguely how filthy the family conference was going to be this time.`
` ...However, after that six-year blank, I couldn't help being shocked...`
` When he saw that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably.`
`"...It's an adult discussion.`
` It has nothing to do with all of you young people.`
` Let us forget about it."`
`"I would if I could...!"`
`"I know that it's harsh.`
` But forget it for now. `
`...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter.`
` Please, don't look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back."`
`"..................`
` No matter how much you ask us, Kyrie-san, `
`......it's hard."`
`"If you explain it that way, `
`......that's not something us kids can do......"`
`"Uu-!`
` Everyone happy-!!`
` Can't get da-rk!!`
` Belie-ve!`
` If everyone doesn't believe we can be happy, that happiness will get away!`
` Everyone has to believe!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"......That sounds good.`
` I'll believe too.`
` That we can be happy."`
`"Uu-!`
` Kyrie oba-san, thank you!! `
`Battler and Jessica also believe!`
` Beatrice is also always saying that the magic won't have any power if you don't believe.`
` Uu-!"`
`Kyrie-san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met.`
`"......Uu-.`
` Kyrie oba-san believed.`
` Now, Battler and Jessica have to believe."`
`"Those two really are strong.`
` They'll feel better soon and do that."`
`"Yes."`
`"More importantly, `
`............I want you to tell me."`
`When Kyrie-san said that, Jessica, George-aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely.`
`...It looked like our parents were so concerned with the inheritance problem that Grandfather filled their minds,`
` but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler.`
`"Uu-?`
` What?"`
`"Who was the person that gave Maria-chan that letter...?"`
`"Beatrice!!"`
`"The witch drawn in that portrait...?"`
`"Uu-!`
` She gave me this letter and an umbrella!`
` And she used magic to fix Maria's rose that was broken!`
` Beatrice is an awesome witch who can do anything!!"`
`"............Could you tell us about it in a bit more detail...?"`
