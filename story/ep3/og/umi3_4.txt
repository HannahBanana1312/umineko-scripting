`"...I see...`
` She's not a witch, Beatrice is the name of his mistress who lived on the island...`
`......So there can be more than 18 people!`
` Which means I can defeat that line of reasoning which says that, if it was impossible for all 18 people, it must be a crime involving magic.`
` ......That's some big information."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Battler-sama, how about some black tea and cookies?"`
`Beato's butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere.`
` A plate set on a silver tray that he held was filled with delicious-looking, steaming black tea and cookies.`
`...I really don't like this guy's smile.`
` For some reason, it didn't look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.`
` It felt like he was making fun of me for some reason.`
`...I don't know whether he really takes me for an idiot,`
` or whether it's just a joke or something, but it's really irritating me.`
`"......I don't need it.`
` I'm busy now.`
` Leave me alone."`
`"Oh, my.`
` Such a shame, the cookies were so delicious too.`
` Cooked so wonderfully it would be a shame to waste them on a simple human, truly wonderful cookies."`
`"I'll eat some when I feel like it.`
` Set it down over there and get out of here."`
`"Will that be acceptable?`
` Then I shall do so.`
` You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret as much as you like that you did not eat them when they were freshly baked."`
`".........You really are annoying.`
` ...Well, you're a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."`
`"No, no, that is quite true.`
` There are times when Milady's laughter becomes quite undignified.`
` Every time I hear it, I find it painful to comprehend `
`why such a noble demon like myself must have such a person as his Master.`
` Pu ku ku ku..."`
`"......Man you're weird.`
` If you don't like it, then couldn't you just not work for her?"`
`"And yet, to continue serving is furniture's joy.`
` If we do not, we would not be working as furniture. `
`......Let us set that aside.`
` How has the game been proceeding?`
` Just now, I believe I heard you say that you had found some good information, and were quite pleased by it.`
` Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has thought up."`
`As Ronove made fun of me and giggled,`
` he followed my earlier words literally and half-heartedly set up some black tea and cookies nearby.`
`"......In any case, it appears that you are now more confident regarding the matter of a 19th person's existence, right?`
` Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"`
`"...............`
`......Yeah, sure.`
` I'm just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.`
` No reason to hide it. `
`......Alright.`
` It looks like there's a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.`
` In that case, the question that's been torturing me, about whether there are 18 or 19 people, can be easily resolved."`
`"You have driven yourself into a corner because of the dead-end that you yourself have created.`
` Even though you deny the witch, Battler-sama, you hold a double standard, and refuse to accept that the culprit is one of the 18."`
`"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......It isn't easy to gather alibis for every one of them.`
` You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.`
` ......I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a sacrifice."`
`"However, I refuse to do that!!`
` Aah, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!`
` And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes interesting.`
` I won't let myself use any one of them as a sacrifice!! `
`In the past, my resolve wavered.`
` That's how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."`
`"......Accepting and understanding your own weaknesses.`
` That is not something which can often be accomplished.`
` Battler-sama, you are using this theory about a 19th person as a spear.`
` ...Or should I say, a shield? `
`In any event, unlike how unprepared you were in the games up until now,`
` let us call the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight, ...a dramatic leap forward.`
` With this, you can suspect a 19th person and can pursue your theory that the culprit is a human,`
` without having to doubt any of the 18 you love and respect."`
`"That's it exactly.`
` Like in the first game,`
` when Kanon-kun was killed in the boiler room,`
` ...there were plenty of tricks I could have mentioned without hesitation, `
`as long as a 19th person existed."`
`In the very first game, Kanon-kun had been killed in the boiler room.`
` One might think that he was attacked by Kumasawa-san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,`
` or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking and had ambushed him.`
` Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.`
` However, by simply proposing that a 19th person existed,`
` there was no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.`
`"In short!`
` I can at least deny the line of reasoning which says this:`
` something is impossible for every one of the 18, therefore the culprit is a witch."`
`Using this argument, it is easy to explain, for example,`
` that problematic case which has already occurred in this game,`
` 'who gave Maria the letter?'`
`Even if all 18 people have alibis,`
` I could easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person must have visited her and given her the letter.`
`".........Hmm, hmm.`
` I think that is quite a good move.`
` How shall I strike back?`
`......Battler-sama, you may already understand, but there are still plenty of weak points.`
` Maybe the '18 people attack' will be an effective move.`
` As an attempt to judge how strong your defense is, it may be interesting to challenge that point again."`
`"Then how will you do it,`
` demon butler...?!"`
`"......I believe it would be appropriate to ambush the piece representing this 19th person that you mentioned. `
`Battler-sama, have you ever met this 19th person?`
` Would you please show some proof that this 19th person exists?"`
`"How naive.`
` Of course, I knew you'd probably try that move...!"`
`"My, my.`
` Please respond to it."`
`"Witches and demons and the like...`
` That isn't a move appropriate for you to use.`
` ......It's one of those `
`'Devil's Proofs'!"`
`When you try to make some claim to humans like us, we always counterattack by telling you to show some proof.`
` Because that's a human move.`
` But I'm fighting with a witch.`
` I'm taking part in a battle with someone who isn't human! `
`And some moves exist which can only be used in a game against a witch.`
` There are cheap moves! `
`And that's what this 'Devil's Proof' is.`
` Because it's impossible to prove! `
`Let's assume that there is a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,`
` and that a woman named Beatrice is living there.`
` In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring Beatrice out of it.`
` That's called actual proof in the human world.`
` However, if we follow the rules of the 'Devil's Proof', you can't deny that she exists, even if there's no proof that she does.`
` Because it's impossible to prove that something doesn't exist.`
`......That's right, I'm finally able to turn the tables using this 'Devil's Proof', which tormented me so much before.`
` Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch by using the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` That was because, with regards to the self-styled witch, Beato, `
`I couldn't offer physical proof that 'witches don't exist'.`
` I kept getting hit with the reckless argument that this meant witches do exist, and was unable to counterattack.`
` And that's why I'll turn the chessboard over right now! `
`If I can't disprove that witches exist, then that means, `
`if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can't deny that either.`
` In other words, because this problematic and mysterious mistress is craftily hiding herself, it would be perfectly natural if you never find her no matter how hard you look.`
` So you can't say that the 19th person can't be found, and that therefore, the 19th person doesn't exist.`
` That's because it's impossible to deny the 19th person's existence.`
` Beato used the 'Devil's Proof' to make denying her existence impossible,`
` but this time it's become my weapon.`
` If we can get away with this argument, then forget just a 19th person,`
` this island could be full of people we don't know about,`
` and even if there were 10 or 100 of them, she still couldn't deny that they existed.`
` In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must have taken a lot of effort to set up.`
` It's very difficult to imagine that a single culprit could have set all of those up.`
` However, if not just a 19th person, but 10 or 100 people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn't be any problem at all.`
` If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.`
` Of course, doubts will naturally arise at whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,`
` but those are all settled by the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` You can't deny that even 100 people were there just because they weren't seen or noticed.`
` Even though I'm saying it myself, it's such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!`
` However, because it's such a dirty move, it's a perfect one to use against a witch.`
` Well, this is just my imagination,`
` ...but what if about 100 suspicious men wearing goat masks were hiding in the shadows......, `
`something like that's worse than laughable, almost like they're cockroaches.`
` If you see one, it means there's 100 hiding in the shadows.`
`"......Well, I think that this is a ridiculous argument that's horribly twisted.`
` If my opponent was human, I'm sure they'd yell at me like I was out of my mind. `
`......But my opponent is a witch.`
` And after all, that is the kind of competition we're having, isn't it?`
` I'll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans, and deny the witch!!"`
`"......Anyway, with this move, I won't have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me again.`
` I won't repeat a defeat like last time again...!!"`
`"......I see.`
` You have learned from your defeat last time.`
` That is good.`
` It is no surprise that by the third game you have become quite devious.`
`.........You first strengthen your own defense.`
` That is truly a solid first step.`
` Quite a spectacular move, I think."`
`"Well, even if we do assume that there is a 19th person,`
` there are still a few tricks left that I can't clear, like the actual number of master keys, no matter how many humans I add.`
` ...Still, it isn't bad as a first step, for the time being."`
`"Battler-sama, your trump card is the important piece called the 19th person.`
` ......You countered my move of asking where the proof was by using the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` ......A good skirmish.`
` Although I have no excuse for making a move by myself when Milady isn't here,`
` .........I find that I too am becoming slightly interested.`
` ...I wonder if you will allow me to make yet another move on Milady's behalf?"`
`"......Come on.`
` I don't care if you're a witch or a demon, it won't be enough!"`
`"This move that you presented called the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` It's a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.`
` ......Do you know of a move called 'Hempel's Raven'?"`
`"Hempel's Raven...??`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*. `
`Ah-hahahahahahahahah-hahahahah-hah-ha...!"`
`Just then, ...aah, that enraging laugh I'd heard so many times started echoing.`
` The room was filled dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.`
`"If it isn't Milady.`
` Good morning."`
`"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away. `
`......'Hempel's Raven', was it?`
` That move is so familiar I could almost laugh.`
` I was certain the day would come when it would be introduced to Battler.`
` It's a classic move to use against the 'Devil's Proof'.`
`......Ronove, I will make this move.`
` Do not get in the way of my fun."`
`"So you've finally shown up, you guffawing witch.`
` I see that you still have that undignified laugh. `
`......This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me about how undignified it is.`
` Right?"`
`"What a surprise.`
` Really?"`
`"Nonsense.`
` Why would I speak such gossip about Milady, `
`of whom I speak most respectably from my heart?"`
`"...I can't believe you'd say something so shameless.`
` Doesn't look like we'll be getting along well together..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well, that is fine.`
` Let us return to the conversation.`
` 'Hempel's Raven' is used to show actual proof using the contrapositive. `
`......In other words, it is a move like this...`
` What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about??`
` Prove that ravens are black...`
`...Wouldn't you just have to catch a raven and check to see if it's black?"`
`"That is right.`
` You must simply prove that 'a raven is black'. `
`And do you see that, if you also prove that 'birds that aren't black are not ravens', you would reach the same argument?`
` If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,`
` then as a result, you can claim that 'therefore, black birds are ravens'.`
` This is called an argument by the contrapositive.`
` ...Is that difficult for you?"`
`"Yeah, completely.`
` ...I have no idea what you're saying."`
`"Battler-sama.`
` What about this example?`
` Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is the winner, with a cookie inside.`
` Of course, the other one is the loser, and is empty."`
`For example, here are two boxes,`
` one is the winner with a cookie inside, and the other is the loser and is empty.`
` At this moment, 'the one that has a cookie is the winner',`
` which means that, at the same time, 'the one that is not the winner does not have a cookie'.`
` When such a relationship exists, the latter is called the contrapositive...`
` When 'if A then B' is true, then 'if not B then not A' is also true.`
`"...Well, that's obvious.`
` If the one you guessed was the loser, then you would automatically know that the other one was the winner.`
`...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it's the winner or the loser,`
` you'll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."`
`"That is correct.`
` If the cookie is in the box you open, then the 'Devil's Proof' is satisfied.`
` You can clearly prove that 'this box was the winner, therefore this box had a cookie in it'.`
` However, if the box that you open is empty, then the reverse, Hempel's raven, is satisfied.`
` It means that 'this box does not have a cookie in it, therefore, the other box is the winner'.`
` That is because, as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,`
` the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."`
`"......Well, I think I'm starting to see your reasoning.`
` Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic. `
`...Then what?`
` How does that overturn my claim that, 'because there is certainly a 19th human hidden on this island,`
` even if all of the 18 people have alibis,`
` I still can't accept witches'......?"`
`"Very well.`
` I will teach you about my move.`
` First of all, you are stating that 'if the culprit is not among the 18, then the culprit is a 19th person'.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this. `
`In short, 'if the culprit is not a 19th person, then the culprit is one of the 18!"`
`"Whaah?!`
` What the, what does that mean?!"`
`"Only that I've countered your move.`
` Let's try and keep things simple. `
`Ronove, explain.`
` It seems you've made things easy enough for Battler to understand with your cookie in a box analogy."`
`"Then forgive my presumption.`
` Allow me to explain my earlier example once more."`
`Allow me to repeat once more my earlier story about two treasure boxes,`
` one of which had a cookie in it.`
` In this situation, there is a single box which represents '18 people', and another single box which represents the '19th person'.`
` So the cookie would represent the culprit.`
` Battler-sama, you open the 18 people box.`
` Because the cookie is not there, `
`you have paradoxically proven that 'therefore, the cookie is in the 19th person box'.`
` Then, in this situation, we could make this next, even more paradoxical claim.`
` In other words, if it was first shown that the 19th box was empty,`
` it would prove at the same time that 'the cookie is in the 18 people box'.`
` Battler-sama played this move in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,`
` but it has now actually been used to prepare the '18 person attack'...!"`
`"......Huh, `
`......what did you say......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19th person box is empty,`
` you will automatically have to accept that `
`the cookie is in the 18 people box.`
` All you have done is say this the other way around, you see?"`
`"So, ......that move that I was so confident in, ...was actually a double-edged sword?"`
`"That's right.`
` As soon as you played that move to explain everything with a 19th person,`
` you had already taken on a risk that you might be forced to accept that the culprit was one of the 18."`
`I see...`
` 'Hempel's Raven'.`
`......So this is a countering technique?!`
`...Wait, if I really think about it, this counter is really disadvantageous for me.`
` I couldn't think about it like a cookie.`
` If I imagined that the 'loser' treasure chest actually had a bomb in it, I could begin to understand it quite well.`
` And there weren't two treasure chests, `
`but 18 plus 1 more for the 19th person.`
` If you think of it as a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to understand.`
` First of all, one of the premises established by the human culprit theory was that the bomb would definitely be in one of those boxes.`
` Because I hadn't wanted to place that bomb in any of the 18's boxes, I had used the 'Devil's Proof',`
` and created the 19th person box so that I could throw the bomb in there.`
` ......That much was alright.`
` But then, Beato had struck back.`
` Now, if the contents of the 19th person box were empty, `
`that would automatically mean that the bomb was set in one of the other 18 boxes.`
` If I could examine the contents of all 18 of those boxes,`
` then as long as I could show that the bomb was not in any one of those boxes,`
` I would be able to safely show that the 18 people were innocent.`
` As long as that was possible, it was all reassuring! `
`However, in reality, that was infinitely impossible.`
` The police wouldn't come here in this typhoon.`
` We couldn't have a scientific investigation, we didn't have any experts on this sort of thing, and we couldn't do anything.`
` In short, we couldn't show anything decisively! `
`It was impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 gave.`
` In that case, I personally had to prove their innocence, and perfectly.`
` Like staying with them the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.`
` And by doing that, I could probably be sure of that person's innocence, `
`and that the bomb was not in that box.`
`...However, in reality, something like that was impossible! `
`In other words, I would have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.`
` And there were 18 of them!`
` In other words, unless I bound all 18 of them in chains and watched over them,`
` it would be impossible to prove that all of them had empty boxes.`
` However, Beato only had to open one box, the 19th person box,`
` and show that it was empty to prove that the bomb was in one of the other 18 boxes.`
` (Furthermore, there would be no need for her to show 'which' of the 18 boxes had the bomb!)`
`I had 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beatrice did for hers......`
`"When a 'Devil's Proof' exists in the world,`
` it takes a vast amount of effort to argue against it, and there are many cases where it is impossible to do because of the situation. `
`However, 'Hempel's Raven' turns that problem around, and makes it possible to prove things easily!"`
`"By using 'Hempel's Raven', various reckless arguments become possible to prove true or false. `
`......For example, let us say that I make the proposition 'All humans except me are foolish'.`
` Normally, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish.`
`...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.`
` It is exactly the same kind of effort you would need to open all 18 boxes."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` However, by using 'Hempel's Raven', the contrapositive of that proposition would change it into this.`
` If you, to use your style of phrase, turn the chessboard over on the claim that 'All humans except me are foolish', `
`you would have to do nothing more than prove 'not foolish=me'.`
` ......And what do you think that means?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`As soon as I know the fact that 'I am wise', `
`I will be able to show in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.`
` In less than a second, I could finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!! `
`It's the strongest and fastest QED in the world,`
` this `
`'Hempel's Raven'!"`
`"Wha, .........what a ridiculous argument.........!!!"`
`"It is a very, very convenient move.`
` Not only demons, but gods also use it.`
` When they propose 'blessed, therefore god's servant',`
` the contrapositive is 'if a human is not a servant of god, then he must not be blessed'."`
`"So in order to prove that servants of gods are blessed with divine protection,`
` they only have to bring ill fortune down upon those people who don't receive that divine protection.`
`.........So by bringing misfortune down upon those people who don't believe in them,`
` they prove their blessedness."`
`"It takes an enormous cost to give humans happiness.`
` ...However, the necessary cost to bring humans misfortune is much cheaper. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` So by using 'Hempel's Raven', gods are actually giving believers the joy of divine protection at the lowest cost."`
`"Ah, ......you demon.`
` It's a demon's argument...`
`...that's all messed up...!!!"`
`"It seems that we've gone off-topic.`
` Let us return to it.`
` The move for my counterattack is complete.`
` ......And now, in response to your claim of 'the 19th person is the culprit, therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn't exist,' `
`I say 'therefore, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,`
` we can be sure that the culprit is either one of the 18 or a witch, `
`right?'"`
`For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...`
` Just when I'd thought that I'd countered one of their strong points,`
` the counter attack to that had been this reckless argument that I could not even have begun to imagine...! `
`Was it really, ...impossible...?! `
`To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people,`
` and still believe in the innocence of those 18 people,`
` .........or was that just a delusion?!`
` Was I just trying to escape reality?! `
`Not yet...`
`......don't give up this useless struggle yet.`
` Who cares about 'Whoever's Raven'? `
`They're just trying to speak in riddles by bringing up some weird bits of trivia...`
` I had used the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` Don't feel uncertain about something you've used once.`
` Believe in the spear you've drawn.`
` And then forcefully, ......gouge it in......!`
`"......We are still in the opening part of the game.`
` Do you plan to keep thinking on this level?"`
`"...............`
` Ah, `
`......wait a sec, `
`I want to be sure. `
`I'll admit that I talked about a 19th person in a way that was easy to understand,`
` but if we're going to use the 'Devil's Proof' to raise the number of people above 18,`
` then we would have no way of knowing whether there were 10 people, 100 people, or an indeterminate number of people.`
` There's always one more than you assume.`
`...Understand?"`
`They had returned my twisted logic with something even more twisted.`
` So the only thing that could counter that would be even crazier twisted logic...!`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` .........Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,`
` as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person, and claim that they are the culprit.`
` By repeating this endlessly, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity.`
` ......I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.`
` I wouldn't expect anything less from Kinzo's grandchild.`
` It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."`
`"......In short!`
` It is impossible to always prove an alibi for each person X outside of the first 18!`
` ......How do you like that, Beato...?!`
` Now that I know we're having a battle with twisted logic, I won't lose!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` How foolish...`
` Who do you think I am?`
` I am the Endless Witch!`
` The thought that you could challenge me endlessly is just absurd. `
`Endless control means that I am able to kill endlessly."`
`"......When your 19th person folds, you will call a 20th,`
` and when your 20th person folds, you will call a 21st,`
` and when your 21 person folds and your 22nd person folds,`
` you will call 23rd person, a 34th person, a 64358223579673204th person,`
` will you trifle with me for all eternity?! `
`I laugh at 'infinite regress', `
`the 'infinite' doesn't affect me!!"`
`"Well then, how will you kill my 'endless' plan? Just try and show me!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!"`
`"...............!!`
` .........Here it comes........."`
`"When I speak in red, it will contain absolutely no illusions.`
` If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,`
` you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person.`
`*cackle*cackle*!`
` See-, Battle-r.`
` What truth shall I tell in red this time?`
` Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come, show me your usual frightened face......"`
`".................."`
`"...............What?"`
`"......Ihihihihi."`
`"...Why, ...are you laughing...?"`
`I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.`
` That red sure is scary.`
` ...Every time it jumps out, I'm driven into the depths of hopelessness.`
` But, ......I had already realized it.`
` ...There was no need to be unnecessarily afraid of the red.`
`".........You've brought out your trump card again. `
`So...?`
` What and how will Beatrice-sama speak in red this time?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` What do you mean by that?`
` Suddenly looking so relaxed..."`
`"Sorry, but I was also waiting for you to take out that blood-red treasured sword.`
` ......Let's see, what will you proclaim in red this time? `
`You aren't going to say 'the culprit was one of those 18 people', are you?`
` Let me warn you, that would be self-destruction, right?`
` That would be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.`
` A complete resignation."`
`That's right,`
` the red hadn't always been a weapon that only Beato could use.`
` It was the other way around.`
` If she used it the wrong way, it was dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.`
` If she used it carelessly and said something which ended up denying herself, that would be exactly the same thing as self-destructing.`
`"Of course, it would also be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.`
` ......No matter who the culprit actually was, it would surely bring me some tough emotions...`
` But before that, it would mean your defeat! `
`Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!!`
` If you want us to stab at each other in a simultaneous clash, I think that's a pretty interesting move.`
` However, this battle will end in my victory!!"`
`Beatrice's red was her true trump card.`
` When that person spoke in red, it was surely the truth, and no amount of proof or counterarguments could change that.`
` Until now she had used that to severely wound me, and each time a little part of my heart would split in half.`
` However, if she used it carelessly, then I could also find a little information about the truth.`
`...In the last game, I had countered that, especially during the chapel's closed room trick,`
` and had once closed her in almost completely.`
` But she was also pretty sly.`
` She had learned from experience, and since then, had started using discretion in the timing of the red...`
` This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.`
`...This was a battle of high intelligence.`
`......No, not of intelligence.`
` It really was twisted logic.`
` This was the world's craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!`
`"So, this time it's your plan.`
` ......That's right.`
` To use your 'Hempel's Raven', `
`first, you'll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18.`
` And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in this group are the culprit,`
` ......that's right, that might be a fatal wound to me."`
`".........I'm surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for that red which you feared so much... `
`You're quite sturdy."`
`"Try taking it out.`
` That trump card of yours.`
` This time, you might be able to make me surrender with a single stroke, right...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Interesting.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way..."`
`Agitate her.`
` Challenge her.`
` Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...`
` Of course her red was always wiping out my only ray of hope.`
` But, ......don't be afraid of that.`
` On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust is,`
` the information that she speaks in red.`
` It was my only way across the chasm of hell.`
` Just a single tightrope.`
` Her merciless blood-red blade was the only way I could survive.`
`...This wasn't just walking on a tightrope, it was like literally walking on the edge of a blade...`
` Of course I was afraid.`
` Because of her contrapositive, my victory condition, the denial of the witch, meant that the culprit was a human.`
` But I didn't want to search for the culprit amid the 18.`
`...Therefore, I held on to a weak point, since I had to claim that it couldn't be a witch or one of the 18 at the same time.`
` Since I had been unable to understand that last time, that was where she had hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.`
`......But that's alright.`
` Let her hit me.`
` Let her attack.`
` No problem...`
` Someone said it once in an old sword-fighting movie.`
` That 'A good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point'.`
` The enemy would gather there.`
` They would be lured there.`
` And that would be where the actual battle took place.`
`...As long as I understood my weak points,`
` and as long as that bitch wanted to attack those weak points,`
` ......it was as if I were inducing her to attack there...`
` Consider that weakness with care, ...and retreat step by step.`
` Make them move forward.`
` The more she recklessly flourished that red, the more chances I would get to strike back.`
` Don't be afraid of the red.`
` Keep her cornered, so that she won't be able to refute me with the red......! `
`No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,`
` ......that's right, that red itself is the same as fresh blood leaking from her wound.`
`"So.`
` ...What's wrong?`
` ......First of all, why don't you tell me how many people are on this island total?`
` If you don't, your raven can't cut me up......!"`
`"..................Hmph.`
` ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.`
` ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era. `
`......It's no surprise you're Kinzo's grandchild. `
`The more cornered you are, `
`............the bolder you become!"`
`"...Ihihihi..."`
`Ronove cleared his throat.`
`"It appears to be a stalemate.`
` That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold, `
`Milady."`
`".........Ku."`
`Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her next move.`
` Beato probably planned to smile back and appear relaxed, ......but she couldn't hide the sweat building up on her forehead.`
` By now she had completely lost that relaxedness which had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.`
` Of course, that bitch probably wouldn't be cornered by something like this.`
`...She was just being cautious.`
` Until now, I had been inexperienced.`
` Without knowing how to fight, I hadn't had enough strength as an opponent.`
` However, now that we had reached the third game, she realized that I was starting to become skilled,`
` and she had grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully......`
` Sure, that's just fine, Beatrice.`
` Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` Are you happy now...?`
`"......Now things are starting to get interesting, right......?`
` Hihihihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Battleeeeeeeeer......"`
`"I'm still waiting...`
` Then, should we get to the heart of the matter and go with the usual?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` The usual, you say.`
` ...Then by all means.`
` If I don't hear that, I guess I just won't feel like starting..."`
`The first move was mine...`
`"Here I go, Beato. `
`Repeat it.`
` ......'On this island, there are no more than 18 people'."`
`"............"`
`"...If I hear you say this in red, I will have no choice but to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......Since it could no longer be the work of a 19th person, all doors will be closed to me. `
`.........However, I believe that the culprit is definitely not one of the 18!`
` There's no way that any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"`
`"..............."`
`"I'll say it again. `
`Repeat it!`
` 'On this island, there are no more than 18 people'."`
`".....................`
`.........I refuse.`
` I won't say why."`
`Whew...! `
`I had avoided what would have been the worse red for me.`
` If she had repeated that, `
`I would be faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,`
` like last time all over again...`
` But Beato had not proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.`
` She had rejected repeating it, even though there was no reason why she shouldn't have struck, even though it was a weakness she should have been drooling at.`
` She hadn't sliced me up with red by using that move, which should have been as good as forking a rook and the king...!`
`......This was a big sign of my advantage.`
` That's right.`
` The culprit isn't one of the 18 people.`
` I won't doubt anyone...! `
`And since the culprit isn't a witch either,`
` .........it means that a 19th person exists on this island.`
` And that's you.`
` A person who, as Grandfather's mistress of 30 years,`
` has been living secretly in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.`
` The 'human' Beatrice.........!!`
`"That's right.`
` You aren't a witch or anything like it.`
` ......You're just a human, ...who's been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"`
`".........*cackle*cackle*.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle... `
`...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a human?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*!"`
`For a while, Beatrice continued to laugh unpleasantly, gloating or maybe spiteful.`
`"...Are you ready? I'll keep going.`
` ...Again, repeat it. `
`'There are at least 19 people on this island'!"`
`"....................."`
`Beatrice fell silent once again.`
` She would probably remain extremely cautious `
`as long as confirming the number of humans on this `
`island might give her some large disadvantage,`
` depending on the situation.`
` The red had already become a foothold for my counterattack.`
` With that in mind, the red had become a risk for the witch.`
` But if she couldn't repeat this, her 'Hempel's Raven' wouldn't be effective.`
` To break my 'Devil's Proof',`
` she would need to settle the existence and number of people outside the 18 in red.`
` That's right.`
` She couldn't break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.`
` I had closed Beato in, giving her no choice but to speak in red...! `
`There really was..., `
`.........a way to fight, `
`......in this witch's game!`
`"It's alright to refuse.`
` ...If you can't say it in red, then that means there are a total of 18+X people on this island.`
`......If that X is allowed in my first move, that's a really enormous hint, right?`
` Anyway, from now on, all of the tricks that were impossible for the 18 people,`
` can be explained with human X outside of the 18 people.`
` ......This is a huge piece that can break open all of the rooms that you called closed because everyone had an alibi...!"`
`It was just like `
`how a chess bishop can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there's a slight gap.`
` It could only be effectively used on squares of the same color, but it had a great ability to control the board.`
`".....................`
`............Ku."`
`It looked like Beato also noticed her current plight.`
` She couldn't just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...`
` If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn't be that difficult to save her from this.`
`......But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.`
` She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...! `
`Because, ...in the first place, a witch was something which should be denied in red.`
` Believe.`
` Don't doubt!`
` Witches don't exist! `
`Something like that couldn't exist in this world.`
` They could only exist in the valleys between truths.`
`...They were a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,`
` and they could only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and illusions.`
` That was the truth by which witches couldn't help but deny themselves, using the red words which only they could use.`
`......The more they brandish their red words...`
`...the more they begin to lose bit by bit that crack in truth inside which they can endure.`
` That was why they didn't want to use the red words and carelessly lose that crack in truth which was based on fuzzy information,`
` ......in other words, illusions.`
` That was because they understood that they were gradually being cornered.`
` Of course, that bastard would never admit it.`
` Because, if she did,`
` it would be the same as admitting that she was something that couldn't exist in this world, like an imaginary number.`
` Don't be afraid.`
` Stay strong...! `
`I know that she is the one who has really been pierced to the bone.`
` Because her red treasured sword couldn't easily be used without a lot of preparation...!`
`"...What's wrong.`
` I'll say it again.`
` ......Repeat it! `
`'There are at least 19 people on this island'!"`
`"..................`
`......Hmph.`
` ...I refuse."`
`In the end, Beato's worries won out.`
` ......Taking a single deep breath, she quietly proclaimed her refusal.`
`......I had thought that she'd use it.`
` But Beato refused to speak in red even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.`
`"You refused......? `
`Which means that, from now on,`
` I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"`
`"Do as you wish.`
` ...I have refused to repeat as you have told me.`
` Isn't that enough for now?`
` ......The reason I refused was, `
`.........`
`...No, I still won't tell you.`
` Anyway, you'll know soon."`
`"...Ihihi.`
` Still acting tough, I see..."`
`"......Red words that I don't have to use are a kind of red words in themselves.`
` You called it my red treasured sword.`
` A pleasant example.`
` I will use it too.`
` ......A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.`
` In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind whether you might turn everything over with those red words.`
` It's some pretty serious pressure.`
`......And there are also times when you make things pretty tough by refusing to repeat after me.`
` ...Those times, I can't tell whether you can't repeat because my guess was right, `
`or whether you're just misleading me and letting me think whatever I want. `
`If you think of it that way, I see.`
` A sheathed treasured sword."`
`".........Wha-t's wrong?`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, I might as well let you climb a little higher first.`
` ...We have still barely begun.`
` Much is left to come...`
` I'll resign from this challenge.`
` ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.`
` ......Only for now."`
`Her being a poor loser looked like it would last for the whole early part of the game.`
` Even so, I couldn't relax my guard at all.`
`...I was unable to relax my feeling of tension until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove's applause...`
`"......Spectacular, Battler-sama.`
` I wonder if you have started this game with an advantageous development?"`
`"Ah, well...`
` I still don't know whether I've taken a piece by my move,`
` or whether she guided me into taking it. `
`......After all, knowing you...`
` You probably know that I'm being led into a trap, and that clapping is just a barefaced lie, right...?"`
`"How could you think that?`
` I am innocently celebrating your ability that has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, even though it is only the first round. `
`...In any event, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.`
` I believe that a little encouragement such as that makes for a good medicine every once in a while."`
`"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."`
`"Isn't that so?`
` Sometimes he offends me as well."`
`"My, my, how incredibly rude of me. `
`Well then, Milady, Battler-sama.`
` How would you like some more black tea?`
` The game has still barely begun.`
` Please leave any tea or pastries that might adorn this game to me.`
` Please, do not feel hesitant and advance further in the game."`
`"I will.`
` Let's move forward.`
` Now is when it really starts."`
`".........Hmph.`
` Very well.`
` Let us advance the clock.`
` Ronove, black tea please."`
`"Certainly.`
` What about a cookie?"`
`"I don't need one.`
` Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.`
` ............Remain silent for now."`
`While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell into silence.`
`......For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.`
`"Very well.`
` .........Why don't I inform you now why I refused to speak in red for the first move."`
`"......What...? `
`Bring it on.`
` Show me what you've got."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` It really is a big piece that you'd hate to miss. `
`......It may be hasty, but allow me to move.`
` I won't use red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.`
` Listen."`
`"Of course, I think the same way.`
` Rosa does too, right? `
`............Rosa?"`
`"Huh, ah, sorry... `
`M, me too.`
` I think that too."`
`".........What's wrong, Rosa-san.`
` ...You've been really quiet for a while now.`
` Are you feelin' sick...?"`
`From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to cut in on the siblings' fights.`
`...But even so, she seemed unmotivated,`
` and had said almost absolutely nothing during this night's conference.`
` The whole time, she had hung her head, and appeared to be thinking of something else...`
`"You've been in a daze for a while now.`
` Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?`
` You are also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."`
`"I, I'm sorry......"`
`"Did you wake up really early in the morning?`
` If you feel sick, you shouldn't overdo it."`
`"......A bed has been prepared in the guest room.`
` How about taking a rest?`
` I will guide you."`
`"No, ...I'm fine.`
` Thank you."`
`"...What is it?`
` Is there something you're worrying about?"`
`".........No, not really........."`
`"Is that so...?`
` It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time. `
`...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we've been talking about...?"`
`At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.`
` As if in response, Rosa's shoulders quivered.`
` Apparently Kyrie's guess hadn't been wrong.`
`...Rosa couldn't deny that either...`
`"...............No, umm... `
`....................."`
`She swallowed whatever it was she had been trying to say, and went silent again.`
` Of course, the other siblings also began to realize that something about her appearance was different from usual...`
`"What is it?`
` ...You've been weird for a while.`
` Did you think of something...?"`
`"All of us've just sworn to remain united, haven't we?`
` Don't be reserved, worryin' by yourself.`
` We said we'd talk."`
`"......Rosa.`
` Tell us."`
`The men pressed her one after the other, and Rosa confessed resignedly and nervously...`
` The atmosphere made it seem as though she was `
`confessing to some modest prank, `
`which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation.`
`"No, umm......`
`......Th, this mistress of Grandfather's, this Beatrice,`
` ......I was wondering if she is still, `
`.........alive..."`
`"Huh?`
` Isn't it obvious that she's alive?`
` After all, she was able to send that letter to us."`
`"Whether she's healthy or not is a different story though.`
` The woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."`
`"I'd think she's healthy.`
` People who are crafty when it comes to money are healthy no matter how old they are! `
`Her evil plan might even be the best rejuvenating agent.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"......She shouldn't be, `
`......alive."`
`"Huh?`
` ......What did you just say?"`
`"Beatrice is, `
`......dead...`
`.........I, `
`...I killed her...!"`
`"Wh, ......what did you say......?!"`
`"...Wh, ...what do you mean, Rosa...?!"`
`"B, but, it's not like I killed...`
`......but, but I was the one that brought her to a place like that!`
` ...I really did kill her...`
` I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!`
` ......But, ......it wasn't really a dream, was it?!`
` Which means this is, ......a letter from Beatrice's ghost!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.`
` Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...`
`"Calm yourself...!`
` Rosa-san...!"`
`"I, I have absolutely no clue what's goin' on...!`
` Already dead?`
` What do you mean...?!"`
`"......I think it means two things.`
` First, ...its literal meaning.`
` ...And second, it backs up our earlier guess."`
`"Which means......`
`.........Rosa, ......has met with Beatrice, right?"`
`"I, I've never heard Rosa speak about that once.`
` ...Rosa, when was it?`
` When could you possibly have met Beatrice?!"`
`"Long ago!`
` Long, long, long ago!!`
` We had just moved over to the island and I was young!!`
` It wasn't my fault, it's not like I killed her...!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"...Calm down!`
` Nobody's blaming you for anything, right? `
`First, drink some water.`
` Okay?`
` Natsuhi-san, the pitcher please."`
`"Y, yes. `
`.........Here you go, Rosa-san.`
` Please, calm yourself......"`
`"........................"`
`Until Rosa was able to regain her calm amidst her ragged breathing, ......no one was able to speak a word...`
