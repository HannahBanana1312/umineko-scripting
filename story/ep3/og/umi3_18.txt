`...Even though it was a pitch-black world where nothing could be seen,`
` ......for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me.`
`......So I tried calling out to her.`
`...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch.`
`......So even in a world where witches have been denied, ......I should be allowed to talk to her...`
`"............Beato......"`
`"......Battler, is it...`
`...............It is done.`
` ......I, ...did it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I didn't hear it, `
`.........but I watched you until the very end...`
` I definitely saw you, ......boldly stand up to that evil witch..."`
`"............With this, ...I am no longer a witch.`
` ...............So, I will definitely...become a witch again...`
`......And then, `
`......I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,`
` .........and once again, `
`............return, `
`......so that I can be accepted as your opponent........."`
`"No.`
` .........You...were a witch."`
`"............Huh......?"`
`"...I...saw it.`
` .........When you took that evil witch,`
` ......and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form, `
`...I saw it with my own eyes..."`
`"Th, ...that wasn't magic, `
`......but the red-"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` .........You were definitely...the Golden Witch.`
` .........You even denied yourself.`
` .........I'll accept it.............`
`'You are definitely, `
`...the Golden Witch'."`
`......When Battler said those words...`
` In the world that had been dark, there was suddenly a single grain.`
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.`
` And...even though it was small, it had a strong, gold-colored sparkle.`
` Then, ......it shone on the two of them, sitting with their backs together...`
` So they each became aware of their own form.`
`...They did not exist only as consciousness.`
`......They became aware that they had bodies, and definitely existed.`
`...No, maybe we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.`
` When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised.`
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.`
`......From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal,`
` ......but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...`
`".........What............`
`......is going on.........?"`
`"The sparkle from that grain of light, ......is slowly getting stronger..."`
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold-colored, but was like the light of the sun.`
` Then, it softly, .........began to approach Beato's chest.`
` When that grain of the sun, ......was sucked inside her chest...`
`......The world was wrapped in a deep blue sky, then a deep blue ocean was spread out below them.`
` An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.`
` And was adorned with more and more things, `
`......made to be like the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.`
` In the middle of the fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings, `
`...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,`
` and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.`
`...And over there, ......were a great many shapes.`
` It was everyone talking together and smiling.`
`"E, ............everyone........."`
`There was Dad and Kyrie-san, Krauss oji-san, Natsuhi oba-san and Rosa-oba-san, and of course, even Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san.`
`......George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon-chan, Kanon-kun, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san are here.`
` Everyone, everyone was in the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...`
`"Wh, ...why...?`
` Even though everyone was dead...!`
` Why are they alive...?!"`
`"......In the Golden Land, the souls of all the dead can be revived.`
` ......Welcome back, Beatrice. `
`And welcome, Battler-kun.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land."`
`"............I, ...made it?`
` ...I made it, `
`...to the door of the Golden Land?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Milady, you have finally been able to invite everyone to the Golden Land.`
` Welcome, Battler-sama, to the Golden Land."`
`"Battler.`
` .........So, you have finally made it this far."`
`"G, Grandfather...`
`.........Where in the world, ...am I..."`
`"My, ...blood, which is incompatible with magic, runs most deeply in your veins.`
` ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and Beatrice has been searching for you the whole time.`
` ...She tried everything to bring you here."`
`"............What did you say......?"`
` `
`"Battler-sama, if you would take your seat.`
` Tonight's dinner is my very best work.`
` If you would, please relish it."`
`"You should be honored!!`
` Normally, I would have eaten all of it, but I left you some out of gratitude!"`
`"......The Nee-chans of the Seven Stakes..."`
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.`
` ......Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, humans, and witches."`
`"...Battler-sama.`
` We were waiting for you. `
`And welcome to the Golden Land..."`
`"Shannon-chan, ......George-aniki...!!"`
`"......I'm still suspecting that this might be a dream...`
` We should have died. `
`......But, ...I'm alive.`
` And everyone, everyone is here, ......and happy.`
` ...I can't believe it."`
`"That's right, this place must be a dream wo-rld!`
` So it must be a dream that George is so friendly with a maid girl! `
`Whaaaaaah!"`
`"Could you give it a rest, Eva?`
` For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young 'uns. `
`The Golden Land is a city of bliss.`
` We should never quarrel here...!"`
`"Here, any people are free to love each other.`
` ...No one needs to hesitate over it."`
`"Jessica-chan, Kanon-kun, so wonderfuul!`
` I'm jealo-us!"`
`"......H, hey, Battler...`
` I'm a little, umm, wahahahaha..."`
`"Battler-sama, welcome.`
` And welcome home..."`
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon-kun.`
` And Kanon-kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow, `
`but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.`
`"With a servant child...?!!`
` You can't, our Jessica cannot do such a thing...!!"`
`"It isn't really a problem, is it?`
` Let her at least choose the person she likes."`
`"She can't, she can't, aaaaaaaaaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"You can't eitheeeeeer, Geooooooooorge!"`
`...As Natsuhi oba-san and Eva oba-san hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their cute children.`
`......Even though they had always been at odds.`
`...It was a very bizarre scene.`
`"......It isn't really a problem, right?`
` It doesn't matter who likes who."`
`"That's right.`
` It's proof that a parent can let go of their children."`
`"Battleer, `
`no matter what kind of woman you bring home, I'll accept her waaarmly, alright?"`
`"You can't introduce her to this guy, alright?`
` He'll get his hands on her immediately.`
` He'll elope right away."`
`"............Battler.`
` You finally came here.`
` Kihhihihihihihihihi."`
`"Maria...`
`.........From the beginning, `
`......you knew that we would be coming here......?"`
`"Uu-!`
` That's why Maria wasn't scared at all.`
` Everyone was a coward and trembling.`
` It was funny!"`
`"......What the hell.`
` ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up, `
`...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."`
`"H, how rude...! `
`I really won't forgive you for speaking of Lady MARIA in that way!"`
`"Firing Curve Formation, Attack Preparations Ready. `
`Lady MARIA, we can attack at any time.`
` Nihi!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...! `
`Ouch!"`
`"...Be quiet.`
` You are in the presence of Beatrice-sama."`
`"Well now, don't be so cold.`
` Let us take notice that now, everyone feels like fooling around and playing together. `
`More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?"`
`"Yes, preparations for my excellent mackerel cooking are complete.`
` I can serve it at any time."`
`"Hey!! You guys!`
` Work a little more like furniture!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` I'm gonna stuff myself some mo-re!`
` Uu-aaah!"`
`"Come on, let's work.`
` Don't keep the guests waiting.`
` Let's work studiously and attend to them. `
`Don't let the guests do anything.`
` Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs. `
`Ahhahaha!"`
`"......Beatrice.`
` Battler-kun.`
` This way."`
`Grandfather and Virgilia were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning us.`
` After Beato and I turned our heads to see what was going on, we climbed the stairs together.`
` From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.`
` A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old-fashioned quill pen.`
` I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.`
`...And below it, many names were written.`
` There were 17 of them.`
`......Grandfather was the first, and everyone's names had been signed all over it.`
` The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.`
`"Battler.`
` Now that you are here, everyone is gathered.`
` Listen carefully."`
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.`
` The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.`
` For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."`
`"Last time, `
`the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.`
` ......Although you probably don't remember it.`
` Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."`
`"......Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I'm the only stubborn one, `
`and that I've been a bother to everyone in various ways..."`
`"That is because your stubbornness is authentic.`
` It seems that you received more than just blood from Kinzo."`
`Beato laughed amiably.`
` I should have felt like she was making fun of me, but without thinking, I went along with her, laughing and smiling.`
`"Magic is a miracle.`
` ......Miracles cannot be completed unless everyone believes.`
` ......And, when you believed in the end, this miracle, ...the Golden Land was completed."`
`"...............It looks like I've been a real pain. `
`...So, what should I do...?"`
`"First, sign here.`
` Then, Beatrice, sign here."`
`"......It's hard to use a quill pen. `
`...Whoa, it shot."`
`"You klutz.`
` Shooting ink is a bad omen.`
` Can't you at least write your name quickly?`
` You are wriggling like a worm.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You should talk...!`
` Don't write it in {c:86EF9C:katakana}!`
` Beatrice is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!`
` You're making the quill and your name cry!"`
`"Sh, shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"`
`"This is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."`
`"Very well.`
` We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.`
` ......Both of you, your oath please.`
` We'll start with Beatrice.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.`
`......'As a good witch, Beatrice swears to continue her studies from now on to bring happiness to the people'.`
` ...Say it."`
`"......H, ......hmm...`
`......I, it's a little embarrassing. `
`......As a good witch, `
`Beatrice swears to continue her studies from now on to bring happiness to the people.`
` ......Is that alright?"`
`"Acceptable.`
` Battler is next."`
`"In the same way, Battler-kun.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.`
` ......'As a member of the Golden Land, Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor'."`
`"Ah, `
`...as a member of the Golden Land, `
`Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor. `
`......I'm embarrassed too..."`
`"Listen, everyone...!!`
` Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans accepting the Golden Land...!!"`
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.`
`......Since I had been the only stubborn one and had just been a pain, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.`
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler-kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.`
` ......This is something that invites the Golden Witch, Beatrice, to the Golden Land.`
` The Golden Land invites the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have accepted it, and becomes complete."`
`"Battler, I will read it out loud.`
` Listen carefully.`
` ............'The 18 of us accept Beatrice as the Golden Witch, and welcome her to the Golden Land'."`
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?"`
`"It seems that is the ceremony.`
` It makes me uncomfortable. `
`Why don't we end it quickly?`
` I've been so hungry for a while now."`
`"......Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good.`
` Let's quickly resolve this signature.`
` What's this?`
` 'I accept you as a witch'. `
`.........Huh?`
` That's pretty simple.`
` Damn you Grandfather, exaggerating it so much."`
`"Come on, come on, quickly."`
`"Sign, right here."`
`"............Huh...?"`
`"Quickly." `
`"Sign."`
`......With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...`
` At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall, `
`and the bustling tumult melted back into complete silence.`
` I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.`
` When I did, `
`............where had she come from?`
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.`
` Who's that......?`
` ......A girl? `
`She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me.`
`......But I didn't know that face.`
` None of the other people here knew that face either.`
`"......Wh, ......who are you?!`
` Who is this?!`
` Where did you come from?! `
`Those without invitations are not needed in my party.`
` Servants, get her!!"`
`"As you command!! `
`Surround her!!"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple loci and blocking her.`
` And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat-head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that girl.`
` On top of that, the Siesta Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...`
`"........................"`
`But the girl didn't move at all.`
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, as though she didn't mind at all.`
`......Who is she looking at...?`
` Beato?`
` Grandfather?`
`............It couldn't be, ......me.........? `
`Yes.`
` ...The girl was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.`
` Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.`
`"You must not sign that!!!`
` Are you going to accept your own defeat?!`
` Don't be tricked by the witch!!!"`
`"......Huh?`
` By the witch, `
`......huh?!"`
`At that time, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.`
`...Wh, what's going on...?! `
`And after being made to turn around behind me,`
` ......I saw Virgilia, with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...`
` A goat monster that looked like it was 2 meters tall was grabbing me with an arm as thick as a log...!`
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...`
` There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.`
` Come, give your signature as well.`
` On this written oath.`
` 'Ushiromiya Battler accepts the existence of witches'. `
`Come now, sign the written oath...!!"`
`"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!! `
`D, damn it, let go!!!"`
`As the goat monsters constricted me with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.`
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!`
`"Battleer, why are you resisting?`
` Weren't you just about to sign willingly...?`
` Don't change your mind now, after all that, alriiiight?`
` Didn't you think for an instant, ...that it might be alright to accept witches?`
` You thought that, riiiiiight? `
`Kukkikikikkakkakakakakakakakakaka!!"`
`"............I, `
`......I was, `
`......t, `
`......tricked......?`
` That's insane........., `
`Beato, isn't that kind of..."`
`"....................."`
`"......Hi, ......hihhihahhahhahaaaaaaaaah!! `
`Sorry, Battleer, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!`
` Aah, it's useless now, it looks like sentimental {c:86EF9C:naniwa-bushi}s don't match well with meeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Teacher, I'm counting on you to use all your strength!!`
` That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored! `
`I don't know who you are, girl!!`
` But I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, alriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?!`
` I'll make you regret being born a womaaaaaaaaaaaan, `
`hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`As Beato waved her gold pipe, `
`the massive chandelier hanging in the hall was electrocuted, and from that, a terrible purple thunderbolt fell...! `
`It should have been a direct hit on the girl right below it, turning her to ash.`
` However, ......not a single hair was singed.`
`"Hoh...!!`
` So it was worth having you show up uninvited...!!`
` Tell me! Say your name!!"`
`"I don't have any name to tell you.`
` .........More importantly, `
`......you idiot!!! `
`How long are you going to be tricked?!!`
` You softy!!`
` Figure it out quickly!!`
` This is all the witch's trap!!"`
`Those words were aimed at me.`
`......This is all, `
`...the witch's trap, she says...? `
`That can't be...`
` Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch......`
`"............Beato...............`
`...Calling it a trap, `
`......is a lie, right......?`
` Please........., tell me it's a lie......"`
`"......Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty interesting. `
`...Still, I was just trying to do what Teacher told me, but it really did work very well! `
`No matter what, after acting bad-tempered and exploring the depths of cruelty, by acting properly incompetent and soft, you get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, ri-ght? `
`I've heard that villains who go soft and then crazy are pretty popular these daaaays, right?`
` Even sooo, I've studied a lot of manga, anime, and {c:86EF9C:galge} that have been popular recently, you seeee? `
`And for you, just as expected, it was 'tears please', and you're down!! `
`Hihhyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha, i-diot, what a truly simple person!!`
` I'll call this 'the North Wind and the Sun Strategy'.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......How could, ............`
`............D, `
`............damn you......, `
`you bastard...... `
`How could you trick me...!!"`
`"..............................`
`......Yes, that expression fits you the most.`
` That caring expression of yours really doesn't match me after all.`
` My back was itching, and I was frantically trying to withstand it. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Too bad, witches don't refo-rm☆ `
`Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` You take care of the signature, Teacher!`
` This uninvited guest is my prey!!"`
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.`
` ......Come on, look.`
` Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"`
`When Virgilia lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise-like power,`
` forced my arm to approach the parchment......! `
`Owowowow..., these guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm......`
` At that time, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.`
` Did that girl save me......?!`
` B, but who in the world is that? I don't have a clue!`
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?`
` Give it a rest.`
` I'm jealous of you."`
`"............I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it. `
`...Sorry, but who are you...?"`
`"..................`
`............Witch of Rokkenjima!!`
` Give him back!!"`
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!`
` Who would do that, you fool!!`
` Battler is my toy.`
` My most favorite toy in the world...!! `
`I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, and I won't hand him over to anyone!!`
` Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.`
` Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.`
` No matter who you are, I won't let you become a hindrance...!!"`
`"Yeah, it looks like you're having a lot of fun. It makes me so jealous, it's irritating!!`
` In a place like this, guffawing and having a loud, noisy time with everyone! `
`Since you're surrounded by all these beautiful witches and being pampered,`
` it must be so fun that you don't want to go back!!"`
`"......A, ...are you talking to me...?`
` Wait wait, you've got the wrong idea...!`
` This is a pain for me too!`
` What do you mean, fun? Don't you know about my troubles...!"`
`"What do you mean, troubles!!! `
`You had fun living with Father and Mother, you played around with all of the cousins,`
` and you get to play with pleasant witches for all eternity!`
` Don't you realize the happiness you have?!`
` Don't you know that I'm jealous of all of you?!`
` So much that I want to join in too!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'm sorry, but I'll have to reject that.`
` I am satisfied with the toy I have.`
` A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` Who would ever play with someone like you? `
`......But I will thank you a bit.`
` ......For bringing everyone together like this."`
`"......Who, `
`.........are you...`
`.....................You couldn't be..."`
`"I see, is that it...?`
` .........Yes, I understand, I know who you are! `
`...I see, `
`so you are the piece Lady Bernkastel threw in.`
` I like it!! `
`Why don't I formally invite you to my party!!`
` I'll welcome you fully...!!`
` Along with Battler, I'll play nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!! `
`Fuhhahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`".........Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` You can't do that!`
` On Rokkenjima in the year 1986.`
` ...I will expose everything that happened to the light of day! `
`I'll teach you that you're no more than an ice needle scared of the spring of the truth!`
` Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!`
` Beatrice!!!"`
