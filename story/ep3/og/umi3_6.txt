`".....................Well then.`
` How will this game be resolved?`
` ...You may submit, and you may resist.`
` ......Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."`
`In his dimly lit study, which was occasionally brightened by lightning,`
` Kinzo kept mumbling to himself, laughed by himself.`
` On the antique clock with the intricate design that had been sitting on his desk,`
` the two overlapping hands tilted to the right, and began to slide.`
` The measure of time that counted to 24 had returned to 0, and had begun to count back again...`
`"......Measuring time is a brutal thing.`
` It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.`
` ......It surely counts to 23:59.`
` However, is it ever able to reach 24:00?`
` ......If you believe that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching it, how futile it seems."`
`No, is that the same as a person's life? `
`You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.`
` People will probably praise the departed, saying that he did reach 24, but that surely is not 24.`
`.........After all, that is 0.`
`"I am different.`
` ......I will live and reach 24.`
` That itself is the Golden Land.`
` ...Because that is Beatrice's dwelling."`
`Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.`
` It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck in the contest, and doing it over every time he didn't like the result.`
` The most forbidden action in tarot reading was to try predicting the same thing twice.`
` That was a desecration to the result of the fortune telling,`
` and also desecrated the existence higher than humans which became an oracle through the tarot cards.`
` However, Kinzo knew.`
` The reason the tarot cards shouldn't be used twice was that, since it was nothing more than a random number generator,`
` it was natural that if you read them twice, a different result could appear.`
`......Therefore, reading twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards' results.`
`...However, that didn't mean that Kinzo didn't take tarot reading seriously.`
` Kinzo's interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.`
` That was to repeat the reading, over and over,`
` without giving up in the slightest, until he reached the result most favorable to him.`
` What the best result was depended on the definition,`
` but if he demanded the best result in a strict sense,`
` it was the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he seeked an arithmetic miracle.`
`......However, to Kinzo, who made miracles of numbers the basis of his magical power, this could become very much like a magic ritual.`
` In other words,`
` until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would strive to repeat the tarot readings over and over, with conviction, turning the feelings of his heart into a prayer,`
` so that when it reached heaven, the result would be sublimated. This was Kinzo's personal magical interpretation.`
` Therefore, even though the tarot cards Kinzo used were exactly the same as generally used tarot cards,`
` the way they were used was completely different...`
`"..................`
`...Tonight, ......will not go as I thought."`
`Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.`
`...It seemed the result he expected wasn't showing up.`
` On the contrary, many bad cards that shouldn't appear appeared repeatedly,`
` and continued to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.`
`"...............Hmph.`
` ...Is that how it is?"`
`It seemed that Kinzo had received some oracle that that was different from normal.`
` But judging by the unlucky cards scattered over the desk, it was difficult to imagine that the oracle had been a good sign...`
` For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.`
` Then as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.`
`".........It is I.`
` Is Genji there? It is urgent."`
`"............Haah."`
`In front of the entrance hall, Shannon's previously burning face had been cooled off by the frigid air.`
`...She had thought, `
`......that George's proposal would surely come sometime.`
` It wasn't that her heart was not prepared.`
` And she had nodded as if in answer.`
` Had she been reckless because of her youth? `
`Should she have thought about her future more seriously? `
`I wonder if he doesn't think of me as a cheap girl because of my immediate reply.`
`...Would I have been able to look like I was thinking more seriously if I had at least held off until tomorrow morning? `
`Now that she had already received the ring from George, Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment.`
` I should have done this, I should have done that.`
` As she did. she heard the sound of footsteps splashing through puddles.`
` Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.`
`"......Genji-sama?`
` Kanon-kun too...!`
` I, I'm sorry, I have to go back soon, umm..."`
`She grew stiff, thinking that she would surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover's meeting with George.`
`"Shannon.`
` The Master told us to come to the study, saying it was urgent.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"......Huh?`
` Y, yes, certainly...!`
` What in the world...?"`
`"He said he had a premonition of misfortune.`
` ......It would be convenient if he could carry out the ceremony by himself."`
`"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn't notice us. `
`Hide your footsteps."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Nee-san, take care.`
` You're so noisy."`
`Kanon was especially good at hiding his footsteps.`
`...Like he was a cat.`
` He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing, and leave in the same way.`
` For example, even though he stepped in the puddles, `
`the sound he made was far smaller than that of the rain hitting the puddles...`
` Genji also had that ability.`
`...Well, originally, those servants called furniture were supposed to be like that.`
` Just like how desks and closets went unnoticed by members of the family, `
`the servants also treated being able to appear unconcernedly when they needed to as a great virtue.`
` In that sense, Shannon's footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.`
`...She was also trying to hide her footsteps, `
`but compared to Kanon and Genji, well, you could say she was a little more lively...`
` Eventually they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.`
` Immediately, .........they thought they felt something.`
` It was different from a sense of smell, ...it was as though they felt it from the depths of their noses, `
`......and this hard to describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.`
`"............Genji-sama."`
`"...Hmm. Hurry."`
`That perception made it feel as though some kind of tension was pressing on them.`
` Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, aiming for Kinzo's study, still hiding their footsteps.`
` When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo's study reached their noses.`
`"..................Mu."`
`"What is it, Genji-sama...?"`
`"......The barrier is, ...dead."`
`"Huh?`
` ...............Ah."`
`After hearing Kanon, she looked at the door to the study.`
` A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.`
` A powerful magic-repellent.`
` The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.`
` It had been broken.`
` Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.`
` However, they who could understand things that people couldn't perceive, were able to recognize that there was a dramatic change...`
`"......Master.`
` Master...! `
`It is Genji.`
` Please open this door."`
`Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.`
`"Shannon, protect our backs.`
` Kanon, search inside the room."`
`""Yes...!""`
`Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.`
` To protect the backs of the other two, who were watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, with her back to them, prepared for the unexpected.`
`"............The Master should be here.`
` ...However, it's too quiet."`
`"Are you saying he is safe?"`
`"No.`
` It's too quiet."`
`"...Could it, ............possibly be..."`
`"Master.`
` Excuse us about the door."`
`Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.`
` It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.`
` He stuck it in the key hole, and turned it heavily.`
`......At first glance, it looked like that meant that is really was a strong lock.`
` However, now that the barrier had been destroyed, `
`this door was as good as open for anyone with magical power...`
` The heavy sound meant that the door could be opened even by humans.`
`"......Excuse me."`
`As Genji respectfully bowed his head,`
` and Kanon's sense of tension grew tighter,`
` and Shannon acted nervous, they entered the study...`
` They immediately discovered Kinzo's figure.`
`......He was sitting in the reception sofa so that his back faced them.`
` Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.`
` Kanon also noticed that person, `
`......and he didn't bow his head.`
` He went in front of Shannon and spread both arms, blocking the way to her.`
` So without even seeing that person's face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...`
`"...So you have come. `
`Beatrice-sama."`
`"Genji is it?`
` You came very quickly. `
`Yes, it is better when furniture answers their master's call quickly.`
` Very different from this person."`
`"............`
`......So Ronove-sama has come as well."`
`Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of Beatrice, where there shouldn't have been anything.`
` Even Kanon and Shannon couldn't have imagined that someone would be there.`
`......However, the darkness answered immediately, and praised Genji's eyesight...`
`"As usual, you don't disappoint.`
` It has been quite some time.`
` .........Even so, you have gotten old, haven't you?`
` Have you really reached that age?"`
`"I have lived a full life.`
` ...It appears that your life has grown to be even more full, Ronove-sama."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you. `
`.........And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you, as well.`
` You have grown quite beautiful.`
` And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.`
` That is fortunate."`
`"............Thank you very much."`
`"......Nee-san, who in the world..."`
`"This will be the first time I have met you, Kanon-kun.`
` ......I, Ronove, have been entrusted with the position of Beatrice-sama's head furniture.`
` ......I am an old friend of Genji-san's.`
` I am also furniture, just like you.`
` Although the master I serve is different."`
`The color of tension didn't disappear from Kanon's expression in the slightest.`
`......If furniture served a different master, they could be kind or brutal or a fraud.`
`...If he called himself furniture serving the hated Beatrice, `
`then surely he was a despicable being as well...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It seems that I'm completely despised.`
` It's as though you hate everything to do with me."`
`Beatrice openly sneered at Kanon's hate-filled face...`
` Then, Kanon finally knew.`
` Beatrice and Kinzo were enjoying a chess game across the reception table.`
` But Kinzo hadn't even quivered.`
` He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight..., as he contemplated his next move.`
`......No, was he in anguish...?`
`".........Master........."`
`"I have told Kinzo two things.`
` There was good news and bad news. `
`......The good news was that he would have the fortune of being reunited with me before the ceremony ends.`
` The bad news was that Kinzo had been selected for the very first sacrifice of the ceremony.`
`*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.`
` Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."`
`"...L, liar.`
` You just take pleasure in killing people......"`
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun......"`
`"......So, Kinzo.`
` Isn't it about time you decided to accept your loss?`
` ......*cackle*, by this, our long lasting contest is resolved, right?"`
`"........................"`
`At a glance, you couldn't tell the current situation on that chaotic chessboard.`
`...However, judging from Kinzo's anguish and Beatrice's malicious relaxedness, `
`it looked as though it was already decided...`
`"............It is unavoidable...`
`...Is this also entertainment?"`
`"It is to me too.`
` ......Resolving my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate. `
`...It was fun.`
` Several decades that were not boring...!"`
`Beatrice advanced her queen, and made her final move.`
`......It was then, `
`decided.`
`"Checkmate.`
` .........This is a final tribute from me to you.`
` Without reserve, `
`...sleep."`
`"Heheheh, `
`......fuhahaha, `
`haah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah!!"`
`Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms, `
`...as though he had succeeded in a century-long plan.`
` That laugh, `
`......spat crimson.`
` Crimson flames poured out from inside him, `
`spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...`
` But Kinzo kept laughing.`
` The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body, and began to char him...`
` Those flames became a brilliant light, `
`which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, and made their distorted shadows dance across the walls.`
`...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, in ecstasy over Kinzo as he burned...`
` And, `
`after making a contract with the witch, `
`it was an extremely fitting end, `
`...in accordance with that contract...`
` After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for a some time, `
`Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.`
` Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though he had been completely burned up, `
`and afterwards, all that was left was a festering and burnt corpse that would make you want to avert your eyes...`
`"...............Horrible..."`
`"Hmph.`
` You should talk.`
` Even though you think that was a fitting way for him to die..."`
`"......Why have you shown yourself...?`
` Do you have some business with us...?"`
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun.`
` ......You must not provoke Beatrice-sama."`
`"It appears that you have completely terrified them.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`"It seems I just can't get along with Kanon.`
` It's not as though you hate me that much, right...?"`
`Beatrice grinned.`
` Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously unhappy.`
`...His reaction was so different from what he had anticipated that it made the witch and her butler laugh.`
`"Kanon.`
` ......You stand in the presence of Beatrice-sama.`
` Carefully consider your manner of speech."`
`"Oh, there is no problem, Genji.`
` Let him say as he likes.`
` I am gracious."`
`"......How are you gracious...!"`
`"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Kanon was taken aback by that creepy laughter...`
` Beatrice's reason for being here was not just to take Kinzo's life.`
` The first twilight required six sacrifices.`
` Kinzo alone wasn't nearly enough.`
`...And they had just nonchalantly came to this place...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't worry, Kanon.`
` ......You won't be selected as sacrifices just because you came here. `
`......It was because you were selected as sacrifices that you were called here...!"`
`".........What the.........!"`
`He instinctively figured it out immediately...`
` Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.`
` After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?`
`......In this mansion, the number 5 instantly made them think of the number of servants here...`
`"............Is that, what you desire?"`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Thank me, furniture. `
`Tonight, your days of suffering will finally be at an end.`
` You should thank me, as I have come to tell you this."`
`".........Certainly.`
` If that is your desire."`
`"...G, `
`......Genji-sama..."`
`Genji had agreed to the witch's heartless announcement in his usual manner, without raising an eyebrow.`
`"After the Master's death, Beatrice-sama is our master.`
` Answering her demand is our final duty.`
`......Shannon.`
` Kanon.`
` You have done well serving until today.`
` That hard work is now over."`
`"......As I expected of you, Genji.`
` As furniture like you, I think honorably of you."`
`"Shannon.`
` ......Do you have any objections?"`
`"......No."`
`".........I heard that George-sama gave you a ring.`
` Is that still, a regret?"`
`"No.`
` ......That blessing was more than furniture deserves.`
` ...Just receiving the ring has already fulfilled my feelings."`
`Compared to Genji, Shannon had not yet reached as high of a philosophical viewpoint.`
` There probably really were regrets left in her heart.`
`....She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person of her thoughts, George.`
`......But she released herself from that.`
` After she took a single deep breath, a blank expression rose to her face.`
`"............That is fine."`
`"I am a little surprised that you have been able to calm yourself this much, Shannon.`
` It seems that you have also taken a philosophical view as furniture."`
`"Won't you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?`
` What a boring woman."`
`"............`
` This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, Beatrice-sama.`
` ......If you desire our lives, please accept them.`
` We will solemnly carry out that duty."`
`"......That is fine.`
` Well said..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Just the type of person Beatrice-sama is bad with."`
`"Recently, this person has taken quite a philosophical view of things.`
` In any case, it seems that I tortured her too much last time.`
` Speaking of which, didn't I do the same to Battler? `
`...Hmmm.`
` Am I still soft?`
` Or is my style of cornering them lacking?`
` In any case, she's just no fun.`
`.........However, it seems that you will still entertain me, right?`
` Kanooon?"`
`"............Kanon-kun..."`
`"..............."`
`Compared to the two who had taken a philosophical view of things, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon's face.`
` Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise `
`after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...`
`"......Kanon.`
` I hate boredom more than anything.`
` And it isn't interesting that those other two have obediently accepted their deaths.`
` ......So I don't want you to betray my expectations."`
`"............Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"`
`Kanon realized that he was being provoked.`
`...However, no matter how much anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.`
` He was furniture.`
` He hadn't had a chance of victory from the beginning.`
` But the witch was expecting that he would struggle in vain and writhe around, `
`and was looking forward to it...`
`......Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.`
` Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two, `
`the only way he could strike back at her...?`
`"Eldest of the seven sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.`
` Arise."`
`"......Lucifer of Pride, right here."`
`"Kanon.`
` It would be too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.`
` No matter how much anger spurs you on, you could have no hope in a battle without a chance of success.`
` Of course, a battle without a chance of success would be boring for me as well.`
`......So, furniture against furniture.`
` Why not resolve it with a battle between furniture?`
` That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"`
`"...............`
`...Please, Beatrice-sama.`
` Is there any way in which I am inferior to this good-for-nothing furniture? `
`As if this cute kid would have any chance against me...`
` Eheheheheheheheheheheheh."`
`"........................Ku."`
`"Show me that you can defeat my furniture, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` If you superbly defeat them, `
`.........let us see. `
`I will let you choose the five people who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.`
` I will welcome the five people you recommend into the Golden Land without conditions.`
` ...How about that?"`
`Kanon understood that he was being provoked.`
`......However, the witch's condition was very tempting.`
` By this point, `
`Kanon couldn't care less about this evil ceremony the witch and the rest were trying to carry out.`
`......On the contrary, it was much more important that he remain alive so that he could be invited to the Golden Land,`
` ...and have his wish granted by Beatrice there...`
`"You cried that you'd had enough of being furniture, right...?`
` I shall grant your desire.`
` I shall give you that human body which you wanted so much that you cried yourself to sleep.`
` What do you say...?`
` Then you could be together with Jessica, right?`
` Ooh, just perfect.`
` You may recommend that Jessica and yourself be invited to the Golden Land.`
`......If you resist because only you will be happy, `
`then you can add Shannon and the person of her thoughts, George, as well...`
` If you're worried about duty, then you can also add Genji.`
` Hoh!`
` That's five people.`
` Isn't that enough, Kanon?`
` .........With this much of a reward, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You won't let me get bored, will you...?"`
`"......She's just playing with you.`
` There is no need to listen to her."`
`"I, ......I don't like it. `
`Are you alright with that, Nee-san?!"`
`Beatrice couldn't hide her evil smile at those words.`
`"I don't like it.`
` I want to be happy!`
` I've had enough of being furniture.`
` I want to become human, ......and have normal love...!`
` I want to know that, ...the ocean is blue, like you!"`
`"............How young.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"That's why I like the young ones. `
`......Genji, Shannon, stay back.`
` Kanon, Lucifer, forward."`
`"As you command."`
`"........................"`
`"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh. `
`I don't like it.`
` ...That way you look down on me, `
`as though even though it would be impossible against Beatrice-sama, you might be able to win against me, `
`......I really don't like it."`
`That was probably humiliating to Lucifer.`
`...But at the same time, she was also happy that she was so lucky, and had this lovely prey all to herself...`
`".........Come, furniture of the witch.`
` .........Don't think that you can look down on me forever...!"`
`"So, Battler.`
` Isn't this a fun show?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Damn.`
` Another weird thing's happening...`
` Like I'd ever accept that it's a magic battle...!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look look, look look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture,`
` no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, `
`look look, look look look look! `
`If everything happens like this right in front of your eyes, that's all worthless, right?`
` Look look look look, `
`Stop thinking already,`
` I told you magic exists!`
` I told you this is fantasy! `
`Don't close your eyes, `
`look closely, `
`look look look look look!!"`
`"Damn it, damn it damn it damn it...`
` I won't accept witches, I won't accept magic...!`
` But, if it's so obvious like that, what should I say?!`
` ............Damn, damndamndamn!"`
`"Come now, don't turn away, look closely, alright??`
` Magic exists, it's fantasy, stop playing detective. `
`I know, you really are awful at not thinking about things, right??`
` Stop, stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Look look, obviously fantasy, obviously fantasy, kihhihihyahyahhyahhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shut up shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!! `
`Don't talk to meeeeeeee...!!"`
`".........This guy's gotten obstinate.`
` ...Won't you apologize and crawl on the ground right now for being so conceited that you think you could beat me...?`
` If you do, I'll forgive you, alright...? `
`I could spare you from having your skin ripped off while you're still alive, `
`and being lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.`
` Hehheheheheheheheh! `
`You're a cute kid, so apologize...`
` If you do, I'll let you die gently, gently, while I'm still in a wonderful mood......"`
`"Be silent, furniture of the witch.`
` ...I have no intention of speaking with you."`
`"S, ......so you say that you think nothing of me, right...? `
`Hehhheheheheheheheheh, that disrespectful gaze of yours...`
`...is really ticking me oooffff!!"`
`"............Kanon-kun..............."`
`"........................"`
`"......Isn't he stronger than he was against Satan?"`
`"That is why furniture is so frightening.`
` Sometimes they even become witches, and treat demons as butlers."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!`
` So, which should I cheer on?"`
`"...Are you, `
`.........saying that this guy's on par with me...!"`
`".........Don't look down on me.`
` As long as you have that pride, you definitely cannot win against me."`
`"Y, y, `
`...you speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the seven sisters of Purgatory, and say that I cannot win?! `
`H, how conceited!!"`
`"...Wha..............."`
`Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had a strong desire to become human.`
` But Lucifer didn't feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.`
`......So, that reached its inevitable result.`
` That result could be expressed by the power of humans.`
` ...The power of the heart.`
`"............That's as far as you go.`
` You definitely cannot win against me."`
`The glowing red locus extended straight out from Kanon's arm,`
` ......pointing at Lucifer's throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...`
`"Wh, `
`......what is this...?!`
` How could I, `
`......there, must be some mistake..."`
`As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the truth right before her eyes.`
`...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn't change the facts right before her eyes.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Well done, Kanon.`
` Wonderful, you haven't made me bored. `
`......How pitiful my furniture is compared to that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Lucifer.`
` You are boring Milady.`
` Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"`
`"I'm disappointed, eldest of the seven staaakes.`
` Ku hihihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`That would have seemed like nothing more than a simple rebuke to an outsider.`
` However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke, `
`and understood what had been left unsaid...`
`"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` You, ......good for nothing furnituuuuuuuuuuuuure!!!"`
`She howled.`
` ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.`
` That form was a demon stake, which bounced off the walls surrounding the room...`
`"How could you shame me so much!!`
` Kill, kill kill kill!!`
` You blockhead!`
` Even though you can't even follow my movements anymore!!`
` I won't play around anymore, I'm seriously mad, I'll pierce your heart in one blow!!`
` I'll plow right through you, and make a fountain of bright-red blood reach the ceiling!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeee!!"`
`"Ka, Kanon-kun.........!!"`
`After Lucifer was completely deranged, with a speed approaching the limits that a human eye could follow,`
` she flew at Kanon's heart...`
` Lucifer confirmed that the sweet taste she could feel was definitely Kanon's blood.`
`...But she quickly noticed.`
`...She hadn't pierced Kanon's heart...`
`"............Hoh.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"This is why humans are frightening.`
` ...Would you like some black tea?"`
`"I am fine for now.`
` This is so interesting I don't need black tea...!"`
`"......K, `
`............Kanon-kun............"`
`"So arrogant......`
`......That's why you can't win against me......"`
`The floor was stained with dripping blood.`
`...It really was Kanon's blood, `
`......but it wasn't flowing out of his chest.`
` Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...`
` Lucifer was arrogant.`
` Even though she had been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her, `
`even so, in her pride, she had believed that he was a worthless opponent.`
` She had gotten careless.`
`......So just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.`
` Because she was arrogant, she hadn't even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.`
`...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.`
`...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.`
` Because she was, `
`.........Lucifer of Pride.`
` Kanon, withstanding the pain,`
` grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right hand, `
`...and pulled it out......`
` When she heard the sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down,`
` Shannon looked away without thinking.`
` There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big that you could clearly see through to the other side...`
` Kanon's face was filled with pain, `
`......but right now, `
`he had won, without a doubt.`
` The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...`
`...So that Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.`
`".........Ga, `
`............gu, `
`....................."`
`"...It's my victory.`
` .........Beatrice."`
`Kanon didn't hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer's throat.`
`......She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.`
` Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.`
` But even so, Kanon released the witch's furniture.`
`......Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another furniture,`
` or a final bit of respect to the witch? `
`In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face-down on the ground,`
` acting like she was vomiting and moaning over the pain in her throat...`
`"Spectacular, Kanon.`
` ......Your great efforts have proved that some of Kinzo's research was correct."`
`Ronove was clapping his hands.`
`...To Kanon, who had a wound on his left hand that couldn't be closed after achieving a painful victory, Ronove's true intention seemed pretty obvious.`
`"......All possibilities are hidden in the human heart, was it?`
` .........My, my, this is why humans are frightening! `
`Well done, Kanon.`
` It is your victory.`
` Spectacular!"`
`"......Haah, `
`......haah, `
`......haah......"`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Kanon-kun......"`
`Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.`
`"That was spectacular, Kanon!`
` Truly spectacular.`
` I was also slightly expecting an upset.`
` How truly wonderful you are as furniture not to let me down.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I think better of you now.`
` I honestly think better of you!"`
`"Y, ......you haven't forgotten our promise, right..., `
`Beatrice..."`
`"Hmm.`
` Of course I haven't forgotten.`
` Witches and demons are unjust.`
` However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to keeping promises.`
` I will not go back on my word.`
` I guaranteed that if you won, `
`I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."`
`"......B, Beatrice-sama.`
` It's not like I've, lo.... `
`higi!!"`
`When Beatrice waved her pipe, heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, she 'fell' onto the ceiling.`
` The ceiling doesn't seem that high to people standing on the floor.`
`...However, people who fall on it upside-down and head-first don't feel the same way...`
`"Milady.`
` Isn't this a little much?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That may be so.`
` Shall I forgive you?"`
`Beatrice waved her pipe again.`
` When she did, the magic that had been effecting Lucifer was released.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, this time she properly 'fell' back onto the floor.`
`"............Ku, `
` `
`............u, `
`...Beatrice-sama, `
`...f, ...forgive me.........."`
`"What are you afraid of?`
` I have already forgiven you, haven't I?`
` *cackle*! `
`So, Kanon.`
` Shall we continue?"`
`".........Continue what?`
` ...You aren't saying that you want me to finish her, are you...?!"`
`"Ah, no, no.`
` It isn't over yet, right?"`
`".........What isn't?`
` ...Stop dodging the question...!!"`
`"I did promise you, didn't I?`
` If you could defeat my furniture, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, riiiiiiight? `
`Come, arise, Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"`
`""""""Kyahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`With shrill laughing voices, the air split,`
` and as a golden splash scattered around, the remaining six of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory showed themselves...`
` All of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, only one of which Kanon had been able to defeat by sacrificing his left arm, were gathered...`
` By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch's challenge.`
`...He had been foolish to assume that a game with a witch would be on an even footing......!`
`"............Laaame.`
` Onee-sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"`
`"Y, ...you guys...............`
` gu......"`
`"I told you, Onee-sama's useless. `
`Even though she acts like she's so great as the oldest sister, that's just on the outside."`
`"Yeah, seriously!`
` Lucifer onee-sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage others' opinions about all of us!`
` Know your shame!`
` You novice!"`
`"............Ku, .........gu......"`
`"Kanon-ku~n, awesome awesome. `
`But don't get cocky, okay?`
` Lucifer onee-sama just brags all the time, she's no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."`
`"...That's why I'm always saying Lucifer-nee shouldn't do anything.`
` It's alright if she just brags all the time. `
`Because those of us who are superior always have to clean up the fighting scenes."`
`"What are you gonna do, Onee-sama?`
` We respect your pride, `
`and we'd planned on letting you challenge him again in that beaten-up body without getting in the way...`
`......But Kanon-kun sure is strong, right?`
` Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there's no way you could win, right...?"`
`"......Y, `
`.........you guys............"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My, my, you sisters are always so lively.`
` Is now really a time for discord? `
`Now that you are all gathered here, you are the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, right?`
` Be nice and execute the task I give you.`
` Swiftly, right?"`
`"Hey, Lucifer onee-sama.`
` If you want to borrow the power of your little sisters...`
` Say it, okay?`
` We want to hear you ask us for help from your own mouth."`
`"Ku, ............you plan to mock me even more.........?!"`
`"'Foolish. `
`Weak. `
`Ugly. `
`Shameful! `
`I, the eldest sister Lucifer, ask my younger sisters to save me'. `
`......C'mon, let's hear it.`
` If you let us hear that, we'll save you.`
` Alright?`
` Everyone?!"`
`"......You........., `
`.........b, `
`......bitch......"`
`The seven sisters of Purgatory unanimously closed in on their worthless sister.`
` Abusing her.`
`...Even Kanon, who had been fighting for his life until a second ago, couldn't bear to look straight at it...`
`"A, as i-, `
`......as if I, `
`......could say, `
`......something like that......"`
`"Quickly.`
` Obviously we won't get anywhere with you alone.`
` Quickly, let the seven sisters strike Kanon."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` Oh, what could be wrong, Lucifer?`
` It is an order from Milady, correct?"`
`"............How cruel."`
`After grinding her teeth over and over, after hearing her sisters' curses,`
` ............as she trembled all over, `
`......Lucifer answered her sisters' request...`
`"...F, ............foolish, `
`......weak, `
`.........ugly...`
`...whaa...!"`
`"Shaaaameful!!"`
`"Sh, ...shameful, `
`......I, the eldest sister Lucifer, `
`......ask, `
`.........whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"`
`She was finally unable to endure saying those words, `
`...and the girl called Pride broke down crying.`
` However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` Don't try to trick us by crying!`
` You haven't finished saying i-t!"`
`"That should be enough. `
`Come, sisters, let us display our power."`
`"I won't be satisfied until I hear the whole thing, okay?!`
` C'mon, c'mon, Onee-sama, keep going!"`
`"That's enough!`
` Come on, this shame effects all the sisters!`
` We won't let them return alive!"`
`"A-lright, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?`
` Any wonderful plans?"`
`"Ye-s, yes!`
` Beelze thi-nks, the seven of us sho-uld, get along and split Kanon up between us!"`
`"Good plan.`
` ......That way all of the sisters can get along."`
`"Then I'll take the head!`
` I'll leave the limbs and guts to you all!!"`
`"No no, noooooooooooo!!`
` I get the he-ad!!"`
`"There's no way that promise'll mean anything, right?!`
` First one there wins!"`
`"Kuhihihihi!!`
` Kanon-kun, if you have a plan for how we should kill you, just tell us, okay?`
` The seven sisters will kill you in an a-wesome way!"`
`"........................Damn......"`
`"......Aaarrrrrrgggh!! `
`You've shamed me so much!!`
` Slicing you into eight pieces won't be enough!!`
` I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!! `
`Here we go, you guys!!"`
`""""""Ye-s, Onee-sama!`
` Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`The seven of them burst at once.`
` They had no desire to play or boast.`
` This time, they would genuinely follow their master's order.`
`...Hit Kanon. Swiftly! `
`The seven sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, deciding how they would kill Kanon.`
` They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.`
`...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks, `
`carving a red character into his body...`
` At that time, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.`
` `
` `
`At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.`
` That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...`
`"Whaaaat!!`
` You're me-an!`
` This has nothing to do with yo-u!"`
`"Ah, I see.`
` You must want to play with us."`
`"Kyahha!`
` Then I'll take i-t!`
` All mine!!"`
`"Beatrice-sama.`
` Is it alright for us to have Shannon as our prey...?"`
`"Hm?`
` Aah, I don't mind, do as you like.`
` It seems Kanon alone won't be enough to satisfy your gluttony."`
`"Wow, I'm so happy. `
`Come on, I'll make you regret coming out uninvited!"`
`"Which one, which one, I'll turn you to unrecognizable scraps of meat,`
` mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"`
`"Idiot, breaking that barrier should come first, right!?`
` Do your job before you start worrying about food!"`
`""""Yees, Onee-sama!!""""`
` `
`As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.`
`...Shannon's barrier certainly was strong.`
` It was enough power to impress even Beatrice.`
`...It was strong enough that frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,`
` and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.`
` But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or an hatchet.`
` For the seven sisters, 'chopping down' Shannon's barrier, while it was a pain, was not impossible.`
` `
`The sound like beetles jumping around grew even more fierce and filled the room.`
` The red barrier started to get cut up and eroded away as though with an hatchet, a saw, no, a chainsaw by now...`
`"............How foolish.`
` Even though you probably know that your barrier can't fully protect you from these girls.`
` Why...?"`
`".........Because I couldn't overlook it."`
`As Shannon covered Kanon, who was already at his limits, sprawled on the floor, she spoke back resolutely.`
`"If you hadn't barged in uninvited, I would have given you a death like sleep.`
` Why have you gone to all the trouble of exposing yourself before the seven sisters? `
`......Isn't death the same?`
` An intense death would torture you even more than dying, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Go ahead, do as you like.`
` Just like you do as you want, I will do as I want."`
`"..................`
`......Hmmmm.`
` In any case, this part of you isn't amusing.`
` Whether or not you would achieve love was the most interesting part.`
` After achieving it, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.`
` I have already tired of you."`
`"Thank you.`
` No words I could hear from a witch would make me happier."`
`"......Hehehehhihihahaha.`
` Then, at least in the end, show me a way of dying that will please me greatly. `
`Seven sisters, can you hear me?!`
` Show me the limits of brutality in the way you kill Shannon!!"`
`"...............Shannon..."`
`"......My apologies.`
` In the end, I wasn't able to match up to your greatness, Genji."`
`".........You're an idiot, Nee-san...`
` If you just leave me be, ...then you might not meet a horrible..."`
`"No, it's alright.`
` ...I received the ring from George-sama and lived as a woman.`
` I have protected you, and lived as a sister.`
` With this, my life is settled with no regrets."`
`"......Nnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, you're pissing me off.`
` That philosophic view is really irritating!!`
` Like I said, you're furniture, you don't even smell like a humaaaaaan!! `
`Look at me, I am a human!!`
` Don't spout off philosophical stuff like you're more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"............How ugly.`
` Is that regret your true form?"`
`"It's not a regreeeeeet, this is called living!! `
`What's this about receiving a ring, so it's alright if you die?!`
` Aaaaah, I can't understand it, not a clue, dejected, astonished, shocked, it's all useleeeeeeeesss!!"`
`"......Milady, aren't you acting a little undignified?"`
`"Shut up, furniture!! `
`Shannooooonn, do you think I'll let you die easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!`
` Now's the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"`
`"............How pitiful.`
` If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,`
` then shudder at your own ugliness."`
`"Don't worry, `
`I'll crush you up so that you're much more ugly while you're still aliiiiiiiiiive!!!"`
`At that time, .........Genji softly entered the red barrier.`
` Maybe that barrier didn't block those without ill intent.`
` Then Genji, ...softly held her from behind, `
`......and covered her eyes with his right hand.`
`"............Genji-sama..."`
`"That is already enough...`
`.........Go to sleep before me."`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Thank you very much, Genji-sama..."`
`".........Hmm."`
`After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand against the area around her collarbone...`
`......As he did, from the area where that left hand pressed, `
`......a crimson stain gently spread out.`
` When Genji removed his hand, `
`.........bright-red fresh blood oozed out of there.`
` That only happened for the first instant, and it was shaped like a crimson rose...`
` And when he removed his left hand covering her face, `
`.........There was a peaceful expression on Shannon's face, as though she was sleeping.`
`......And she fell softly, `
`...silently, `
`.........and slept.`
` Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could not reach her, `
`no matter how evilly they tortured her...`
` Beatrice and the seven sisters were shocked by this scene.`
`...Only Ronove had a mysterious expression along with his smile.`
` Then Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.`
`".........You did well.`
` You should also sleep now."`
`"........................`
`............Yes.`
` Thank you very much, Genji-sama."`
`Just as he had done with Shannon, after gently covering Kanon's eyes with his hand, `
`Genji gently covered the area around Kanon's collarbone with his other hand.`
`......And when that was removed with the lightness of a feather, `
`...there was a crimson rose shape.`
` But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright-red blood pouring out...`
`"Wh, `
`............what is, that......"`
`"......What a boring person.`
` ...Even though it's fun to poke the balloon of life with a needle so that it forcefully explodes."`
`"Spectacular, Genji.`
` ............You truly are furniture."`
`"......Thank you very much. `
`...Well then, Beatrice-sama, Ronove-sama.`
` With this as my final task, allow me to rest."`
`"............Grr.`
` You took what I was playing with. `
`Why don't I take all of that thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them, `
`and give it to you instead??"`
`Beatrice faced him with an unsatisfied expression, `
`but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.`
`"You have worked hard.`
` You are my greatest servant.`
` ......I shall bestow as a final gift to you a peaceful sleep worthy of all your labors until now."`
`"Wha?!`
` Wait, what are you...!"`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, `
`......Genji looked like a puppet whose strings had been cut and which fell sprawled on the floor,`
` ...suddenly, and yet gently.`
` He fell, sprawled on the floor, into a sleep that witches couldn't call him back from...`
` That was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...`
`"......What was that, Ronove?`
` ......What a boring anticlimax."`
`"Are you not a powerful Great Witch, Milady?`
` Something such as this is not enough to pay attention to. `
`......Having the blood rush to your head because of provocation from someone like Shannon, isn't like you."`
`"........................`
`...Hmm."`
`Was there something that Beatrice didn't like?`
`...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon's words? `
`Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of humans and a woman's heart, and ordered the seven sisters to go.`
`......After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.`
` The seven sisters disappeared in ecstasy...`
