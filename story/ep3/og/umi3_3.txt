`Without even being allowed to wait for dessert, we were chased out of the room.`
` I heard that, in the end, our parents were unable to get Grandfather to respond.`
`...Well, it sounds like Grandfather's feeling pretty good about himself.`
` He was probably pretty satisfied with how his strange letter had given his children a good shock, since they had all been so infatuated with the distribution of the inheritance while Grandfather was still alive.`
` I also felt like our despicable parents had gotten what they deserved in all of this confusion.`
`......But I couldn't really say that I was feeling great.`
` I felt all sulky.`
` Apparently, Grandfather hadn't seemed concerned with the whole thing, but he also hadn't denied anything about the letter either.`
` When talking about the witch's letter, Grandfather's name kept popping up.`
` If Grandfather knew that someone was stealing his name, then considering his character, he would probably be mad with rage.`
` But even though Grandfather now knew the contents of that letter, he coldly ignored it.`
` In this case, did that count as a silent yes? `
`Eva oba-san and Dad were trying to interpret the letter in their favor, their greed clearly visible.`
` It wouldn't have mattered so much if that was all, but the adults had now started focusing on Maria, who had received the letter.`
` They kept pounding her with questions about who had given her that letter.`
` Maria repeated over and over again that she had gotten it from Beatrice, but there was no way that such a mysterious person would sneak onto the island.`
`...In any event, this was a small island where no one lived outside the Ushiromiya family.`
` Maria kept repeating that she had gotten it from Beatrice no matter how many times she was asked.`
` It seemed that the adults felt that she was trying to trick them, so they didn't hold back and questioned her until she broke out in tears...`
` When Maria was released, she sobbed, all worn out from crying.`
` After our parents ordered us to go to the guesthouse and take Maria with us,`
` they shut themselves up in the dining hall, and started getting louder and louder as they discussed the inheritance.`
` It seemed that, because of that strange letter, the possibility had appeared that Krauss oji-san's ability to become the next head had been reduced to a blank slate,`
` and in exchange for accepting him, my dad and the rest were trying to swindle Krauss oji-san out of a lot of money..., something like that.`
` Astonished as we were, Jessica and I were happy to move over to the guesthouse.`
` We didn't want to be under the same roof as those filthy adults, their heads so filled with thoughts about money.`
` George-aniki pleaded on behalf of our parents, saying that he wanted us to understand them.`
`...I understood his reasoning.`
` No matter how filthy this talk of money was, it wouldn't go away if you just closed your eyes to it.`
` But even so, how could they sink so low as to overtly fight over the money of the dead...`
` Maria had cried herself dry, and was hiding in her bed.`
` She hadn't even twitched for a while, so she was probably sleeping...`
`".........Who in the world gave that letter to Maria-chan?"`
`"George nii-san,`
` you can't ask her that.`
` Isn't it fine to say that Maria got it from Beatrice and leave it at that...?"`
`"Because we don't want to make her cry any more than this."`
`......Even though we said that,`
` we couldn't clear away our gloomy feeling.`
`"There are only 18 people on this island now.`
` The thought that, somewhere in the rain, a 19th person gave Maria-chan that letter, and is now hiding somewhere,`
` doesn't seem realistic at all."`
`"Probably..., Shannon or someone put on the dress from that portrait, and skillfully planned this ahead of time with Maria.`
`...Of course, as soon as Maria saw that dress, that might have been enough to convince her that it was Beatrice."`
`"Maybe it doesn't really matter who handed her the letter.`
` The important thing is who sent it. `
`...The point is that Grandfather wanted to cause an uproar by assuming the name of the witch.`
` Seriously, that old geezer's good at riling people up."`
`It was probably true that our occult-loving Grandfather was playing around, `
`since he had chosen that dramatic way of handing the letter over to Maria, who shared the same hobby as he did.`
`......Failing to consider how much Maria was troubled would trouble her even more, but...`
`"Seriously. Messing around with Maria's pure heart...`
` It doesn't matter who handed the letter over. `
`Maria says that she got it from Beatrice, so let's treat it that way."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's do that.`
` To Maria-chan, Beatrice is kinda like what Santa Claus is to most kids."`
`"As long as we accept that there is some non-existant 19th person or Santa Claus,`
` they will at least 'exist' inside Maria.`
` ...I see, it's important to lie to a child to protect their dreams.`
`............Hmm?`
` What's up, Jessica?`
` Are you still angry?"`
`Jessica had her hand on her chin, as though there was something that she just couldn't understand.`
` When I called out to her, she came to her senses.`
`"Aah, ......sorry.`
` Well, ......actually,`
` ......I was wondering if it was possible that Maria actually met Beatrice."`
`"...What do you mean by that?`
` Are you saying that there's a 19th person on this island?"`
`"If we take what Maria-chan said to heart, then we do arrive at that answer."`
`"No, that's not what I mean. `
`......I'm talking about the story that someone we don't know has been living on this island since long ago."`
`"Living, you say. Where?"`
`"...In the forest."`
`The adults were gathered in the dining hall, spending a very long time continuing the discussion that had been started by Beatrice's letter...`
` Krauss strongly claimed that the letter was a simple prank,`
` but he couldn't overturn the claim that Kinzo's failure to deny the letter was answer enough.`
` Judging by Kinzo's character, if he knew that a letter had been written which faked his name, he would be mad with rage.`
` Since all of the siblings knew that, Krauss had no choice but to withdraw his claim.`
` Without even having to summarize it, the contents of the letter were simple.`
` The person who could solve the witch's epitaph would receive the inheritance and assets.`
` This did a lot of damage to Krauss, who had been sure that he would receive the inheritance,`
` and was better news than the rest of them, who had already given up, could have hoped for.`
` However, there were some points that worried them.`
`'The person who solved the epitaph' was not limited to a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Taken literally, anyone, no matter how doubtful their origin, could receive the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And furthermore, this meant there was a chance that all of the Ushiromiya family's assets could be stolen by some unknown person.`
` In that sense, it was definitely not a situation where even the other siblings could afford to lower their guard.`
` Had this letter come from an assassin sent by Kinzo who called themselves Beatrice?`
` ...Or was this the scheme of some unknown person trying to steal the Ushiromiya family's wealth?`
` They still didn't know the truth.`
`...But they could say one thing for certain.`
` Maria had, `
`received this problematic letter, `
`today, on this island.`
` In other words, someone who was planning something related to that letter was on this island today.`
`......Was the person who set it up Kinzo, one of the four siblings,`
` or maybe some unknown person? `
`No matter how much they suspected each other, they couldn't reach a conclusion.`
` After getting tired of bickering with each other, `
`they finally reached the extremely obvious conclusion that doubting each other was just a waste of time...`
`"......We've made no progress.`
` We've just been wasting time."`
`"That's right.`
` Now that you realized it, we won't have to waste so much."`
`"It is not certain that Father is the one who sent the letter.`
` You've done nothing but leave my husband dumbfounded by ending this conversation."`
`"Who's ending the conversation?`
` You keep yelling at me every time I say something.`
` Do you truly think that such shameful behavior is fitting for a member of the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva.`
` You too, Natsuhi-san.`
` That topic's finished for now."`
`"Sh, shall we all cool our heads off for now?`
` Let's have some cool drinks brought over."`
`"That sounds good.`
` It would probably be wiser if we cooled our heads.`
` Don't you want to take a short break too, dear?"`
`"...Because Aneki looks like she's in a bad mood,`
` I'll pass on that break. `
`But I agree about the cool drinks.`
` Rosa, have someone bring some water.`
` A whole pitcher."`
`"Yes, understood..."`
`Rosa headed over to the extension telephone in a corner of the room and called the servant room.`
` She then passed on what Rudolf had told her to the person on the other end.`
` The vicious bickering up until now vanished as though it had been a lie.`
` That silence continued until Gohda finished setting the table and retreated from the room...`
`".........Is there anything else that you require?"`
`"No.`
` Please leave us."`
`"Yes.`
` ...Then if you will excuse me.`
` If you need anything, call me at any time."`
`After listening to the sound of Gohda's footsteps disappear off into the distance, everyone took a deep breath at the same time to break the tension.`
`"...It sure is raining hard.`
` I wonder if this 19th person is taking shelter in the arbor in the rose garden?"`
`"I, ...I wonder. `
`......They might be able to endure the rain, but it would be quite cold."`
`"......A mysterious 19th person as a visitor.`
` Sounds pretty interestin', just like a mystery novel. `
`Normally, in that kind of story, it's a safe bet that the person doesn't exist, that one of us 18 would be fakin' it."`
`"...I suspect Genji and the others. `
`Just as I thought, no matter how we try to assign blame, it would have been better if we had dismissed all of the servants of the One-winged Eagle."`
`"Come now, don't say that.`
` We must be grateful for their long years of service. `
`...Of course, we can't let our guard down."`
`"I'm sure you agree too, Nii-san, that whether or not Father was behind this,`
` the person who handed Maria the letter was a servant."`
`"Hmm.`
` In any event, we were all being 'friendly' in our big happy circle the whole time until dinner, weren't we?`
` All of the siblings have alibis.`
` Only a servant could have handed Maria that letter."`
`"...But all of the servants,`
` ...said that they were too busy with the bed-making to have any spare time during which they could go to Maria-chan in the rose garden...`
`.................."`
`"Hey hey, what are you trying to say then?`
` You aren't saying that the witch of the forest, Beatrice-sama came over and actually handed Maria that letter, are you?"`
`"Ah-hah-hah-ha.`
` Rosa, you used to believe so much that it really frightened you, right? `
`You don't mean to say that you still believe at this age, right?`
` The witch of the forest."`
`......If she did exist I'd love for her to appear.`
` But no matter how much I wished, she didn't appear before me even once.`
` She didn't save me from my crisis...`
`"O, of course not...`
` I just thought that since all 18 of us said that we didn't do it, there might really be a 19th person..."`
`"That can't be. In the first place, we were the only ones who came on that boat.`
` We didn't see any mysterious stranger ridin' with us. `
`You don't think that they might have swam across this rough sea, right?`
` I can't really imagine it.`
` Wahahahahahaha."`
`"......Logically that's true.`
` It is difficult to imagine that there's a single hidden and uninvited guest on this isolated island...`
`...However,`
` .........it still looks like there are some people who can't entirely throw that possibility away, right?"`
`Hideyoshi had laughed it off, saying that there couldn't be a 19th person,`
` but Kyrie had sensitively picked up on the delicate atmosphere among the four siblings.`
` In a normal situation, there shouldn't have been any guest on this small, isolated island who hadn't been invited.`
` How had they come here, and from where, and where were they hiding themselves? `
`And why hadn't they appeared openly, even though they had sent a letter in their name?`
` ...Nothing could explain that.`
` But not only had the four siblings not joined in on Hideyoshi's laughing,`
` they also seemed unable to completely deny in their hearts the possibility of a 19th person...`
`"Kyrie-san,`
` I don't want you to misunderstand, but we don't believe in anything like that fairy tale-like legend of the witch."`
`"......Another topic to insult Father, is it?`
` Simply saying that is a betrayal against Father."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` I wonder. `
`......However, this is Father we're talking about.`
` It could be possible, ......right?"`
`"............I, ...I don't know anything......"`
`"What's this, what's this?`
` Why's everyone gotten so gloomy...?`
` What are you talkin' about? `
`...In short, the legend of the witch isn't a joke, ...but a fact?`
` That's ridiculous!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Of course, nobody believes in some witch riding a broom and flying in the sky. `
`......But, the woman in that portrait,`
` ...Beatrice, may really exist on this island."`
`".........Hideyoshi-san,`
` it looks like we aren't talking about a witch, but something a little simpler. `
`...So, it must be something like this.`
` Everyone suspects that Father has a mistress named Beatrice secretly living somewhere on this island.`
` ......Is it something like that?"`
`"Father was a man who was exemplary at strictly obeying the rules!`
` It is completely inconceivable that he would bring something so filthy onto this island...!"`
`Natsuhi snapped at them immediately, but it looked like the four siblings, including Krauss, didn't think that way.`
`...On the contrary, it appeared that they thought Kinzo wouldn't even have hesitated to do something like that.`
` It had been whispered from the beginning that Kinzo had built a mansion on this island `
`because of the existence of an entrancing mistress......`
`"......I'm sorry, Natsuhi-san. I know how much you respect Father, but that rumor's been around for a long time.`
` Father prepared this island by himself, and built everything.`
`...It's been suspected from the beginning that Father had some device or secret room in this mansion,`
` and it has always been whispered that a secret mansion that none of us knew about was hidden somewhere on this island."`
`"I see.`
` This island might look small on a map, ...but it's quite large for just the Ushiromiya family to live on. `
`......So people have wondered whether he might have built a secret mansion somewhere in the uncivilized forest for his mistress to live in?`
` That's a rather large-scale story."`
`"In the beginning, we used to say that it might be somewhere inside this mansion.`
` ......That there might be a hidden basement, with a fabulous hidden room, where the witch in that portrait was secretly hiding. `
`...After seeing that intricate auto-lock on Father's study, it isn't too hard to imagine, right?"`
`"......In any event, Father did spread the rumor that a large amount of gold was hidden somewhere by some mechanism.`
` I wouldn't be surprised if there existed some hidden room inside this very mansion that none of us knows about yet."`
`"When Mother was alive, she would often scour the entire mansion searching for Father when he wasn't anywhere to be found.`
` ......Mother also suspected what Rudolf has just said.`
` She believed that there was a hidden door or stairway somewhere, and that his blonde-haired mistress was hidden behind it."`
`It's hard to believe, but there are some actual examples in other countries of people cheating with someone over a period of several decades by making them live in a hidden attic room.`
` Furthermore, Kinzo had a mansion this extravagant.`
`......It was possible to suspect the existence of a hidden room...`
`"From what I've heard,`
` ...the legend of the Rokkenjima witch was just a fairy tale made up to prevent children from entering the uncivilized forest by scaring them.`
` ...But it's starting to sound like there's a little more to the story."`
`"Well,`
` as you know, this is a lonely island without anything but the Ushiromiya mansion on it. `
`When Rosa and I were little brats, on stormy nights, we were so scared by the sound of trees rustling, which came from the forest.`
` We had this crazy delusion that something weird might be looking out at us from between those trees.`
` It's only natural for any brat to think something like that.`
`...But when Rosa and I complained about it, there were some people who couldn't accept it as a mere delusion.`
` ...Isn't that right, Aneki?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` Nii-san and I thought that you might have, by coincidence, spotted Father's mistress, who had been living in secrecy on this island, as she went out for a walk when no one was looking.`
` Of course, Mother did too."`
`"...Among the older servants too, you often heard that ghost story about how the witch of the portrait wanders around the mansion at midnight.`
` Outwardly, I laughed that off as just a ghost story, but on the inside, I suspected very much that it referred to the existence of a hidden mistress."`
`"In that case, .........you're sayin' that the existence of a 19th person...`
` might not be completely ridiculous?`
` ...That they might actually be somewhere around here......?"`
`".........Sounds like a case of that 'Devil's Proof' Rudolf's always talking about. `
`...It might be possible to prove that there is a 19th person, but it's impossible to prove that a 19th person doesn't exist.`
` ......Should we continue this discussion assuming that there is a person named Beatrice hiding somewhere on this island......?"`
`"As a basis for handling the worst case scenario, I believe that is appropriate. `
`It's probably much more prudent to say she might exist, rather than saying she couldn't exist."`
`"I, ...I see.`
` Sorry, I was a bit careless...`
` Rosa-san, sorry for laughin' just now..."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ......it's alright, I don't mind."`
`Hideyoshi apologized deeply for taking the worst case scenario lightly, despite calling himself the president of a company.`
` Silence fell again.`
` By preparing for the existence of a 19th person,`
` they were accepting that some unknown person was hidden on this island.`
` And since this person might have been planning something bad for them, `
`it was only natural that a few uncomfortable things might come up...`
`"......In the past, Father would sometimes suddenly disappear without telling anyone where he went.`
` After all, he is a person who appreciates silence.`
` It wouldn't have been out of the ordinary for him to shut himself up in some archive after purposefully not telling anyone where he was going.`
`......However, after the witch theory began to be refined into the theory about his mistress, it was eventually whispered that he was secretly going back and forth to this mistress."`
`"Mom was completely overridden with doubt in her final years.`
` She would sometimes suddenly start making a racket, asking the servants to start looking for Father immediately because of some urgent situation."`
`"......Yes, that did happen sometimes.`
` Mother was always doing things like that in her later years, and that frightening atmosphere still hasn't gone away. `
`...I can say it for certain now.`
` She was a pitiful person."`
`"So then, ...what were the results of those large-scale searches of the house?`
` Did they find anythin'?"`
`"No.`
` Father wasn't caught foolishly in a hidden room even once.`
` Every time, after a lot of time had passed, he would suddenly show up somewhere.`
` Then he'd say that he'd taken a nap in some archive or that the wind had called him down for a walk on the beach.`
`...But it was always some place where the servants had already looked.`
` ......We never knew where Father had gone.`
` Since that time, Grandfather started to become famous for his adoration of the occult,`
` so some of the servants exaggerated, saying that he might have turned into butterflies and danced around the rose garden."`
`"So in short, Father frequently disappeared, and no one knew where he went."`
`"Yeah.`
` Since we couldn't find him no matter how much we looked inside the mansion, we grew increasingly of the opinion that Father might have gone somewhere outside the mansion.`
` But the area outside the mansion isn't large at all.`
` ......Which leaves only the forest.`
` And if you tie that in with the legend of the witch, you get a theory like this: `
`Father actually built a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest,`
` inside of which a mistress by the name of Beatrice lived, and he sometimes went to see her."`
`"...I was also young at the time.`
` I was so enthusiastic to find where Father was having his affair that, at one time, I followed him when he went outside.`
`...Of course, it was a failure.`
` Every time Father went outside, he was oddly intent on avoiding places where he was visible, and was extremely cautious to prevent anyone from seeing him.`
` He was like that to a very odd extent. `
`But that actually made me sure.`
` He must have been going out for some reason that the members of his family couldn't know about."`
`"And that would be going to meet his mistress. `
`Probably tryin' to avoid being seen."`
`After seeing Hideyoshi nod and say 'yes, yes' as though this was quite obvious, Eva got a little sullen.`
`"...Well, anyway.`
` This island was like a sketchbook in which Father, with his western obsession, could draw out all of his dreams.`
` ...Everything about this island was exactly how Father wanted it.`
` It wouldn't be odd at all if there were some hidden mansion for his mistress to live in..."`
`Eva's words spoke for what all of the siblings had come to think.`
` For a while, the room returned to silence again, and everyone listened to the sound of the wind and rain...`
`......Was there a hidden mansion on this island, and had Kinzo's mistress been living there in hiding for a long, long time......? `
`Everyone thought that they were being too suspicious, and they hesitated for a long time without speaking, but...`
`......everyone shared a common opinion.`
` Kyrie, who had been listening the whole time with her eyes closed, spoke to no one in particular.`
`"...How long has this rumor about Father's mistress been around?"`
`"As soon as we moved to this island, about 30 years ago. `
`Anyway, it probably would have been impossible for him to have a hidden mansion constructed while we were here.`
` People and materials would have to be going in and out.`
` It would have been exposed quickly.`
` Therefore, if it was possible, it happened before we moved here.`
` ...It probably could have been built along with this mansion when we were still living in Odawara."`
`"Since Father had to set up a double life with his family and his mistress, it's probably appropriate to assume that he had it all planned from the beginning.`
` And his relationship with that mistress probably went back to the days when we lived in Odawara."`
`"Probably.`
` If, as Father says, she is the source of the vast amount of gold that he used to gain the funds which resurrected the Ushiromiya family,`
` we could probably conclude that they had a close relationship since Odawara. `
`......A relationship trusting enough for her to lend him a vast quantity of gold.`
` I can't even imagine how old that relationship must have been."`
`".........Possibly, after achieving success in business, Father gave her some kind of valuable advice.`
` It's natural to think that, out of a sense of gratitude for that, this person gave Father the gold.`
` If you think about it that way, it's obvious that they would have a close relationship after that.`
` Rather than a festering relationship with a mistress, it was probably a relationship of gratitude to the person who saved the Ushiromiya family from crisis."`
`"......I don't know whether what Natsuhi-san's saying has a ring of truth to it or not.`
` But, even in that case, isn't building a hidden mansion and havin' her live in it going a little too far?`
` Doesn't that mean that there were some emotions in play beyond gratitude?"`
`"Well, this is all speculation.`
` ......In the first place, no one has ever found that hidden mansion. `
`...Aniki was planning on expanding this island into a resort, right?`
` As you were doing that, you didn't manage to stumble on it by chance, did you?`
` Or maybe unexpectedly find some gold there, too?"`
`"...Hahahaha.`
` Do you think Rokkenjima is Treasure Island or something?"`
`"Don't play dumb.`
` ...We know that, although you say that you are opening a resort, you have really been planning to investigate the entire island, right? `
`Judging by all that trouble and confusion we were talking about earlier, you haven't been very successful, have you?"`
`"I don't know what you're talking about, it's a misunderstanding.`
` Isn't it perfectly natural that investigating this island would be the first step in turning it into a resort?"`
`Krauss tried to play dumb, but it was plainly obvious to his siblings, who knew him so well.`
`...Krauss was definitely sure of the existence of a hidden mansion.`
` And under the pretense of opening a resort, he had been closely investigating the island, searching for a clue as to the location of the hidden gold.`
` They couldn't tell whether that conviction was just him over-thinking things, or whether it was based on some physical proof.`
`......Still, if Krauss, with all his guile, was sure,`
` that was enough proof for the other siblings to be sure, too...`
`"......The story about a witch livin' in a forest is obviously a fairy tale,`
` but the story about some blonde-haired girl livin' secretly in a mansion no one knows about in the middle of the forest...isn't much better."`
`"That's right.`
` That situation would sound just like a children's story. `
`You like those, don't you Rosa?"`
`"......Huh, ......w, ...well..."`
`"When the mansion was built on this island, Father was at the height of his prosperity.`
` With his money, he could probably obtain anything, make any of his delusions real.`
` ...A mansion in the forest where a witch quietly waits...`
`......It sounds like the kind of situation Father would like."`
`"......Doesn't it?`
` Like something from the occult or a fairy tale.`
` ...It feels like Father's hobby."`
`On this island, which the Ushiromiya family had lived on for 30 years now,`
` a hidden mansion that no one knew about had been quietly built, with a witch, who was unknown except for a portrait, living in it...`
` Even this hastily thrown together story,`
` ...might not be completely delusional considering all of Kinzo's strange habits and his vast wealth...`
`"......It might not have been impossible for Father to build a hidden mansion to satisfy his dreams. `
`......However, let's be realistic.`
` Would it be possible to house his beloved woman in that hidden mansion for decades without it becoming inconvenient...?"`
`"......Well,`
` if there was love, it could have been possible, right?"`
`"Think about the facilities needed to let his beloved woman live healthily.`
` ...And how Father would do it.`
` For example, even if it was on a small scale, it would have to be an intricate and pleasant residence.`
` And it would probably need to have `
`electricity, `
`gas, `
`and running water maintained, `
`as well as some people to help her.`
` Cooking would be quite difficult.`
` She would need clothes and makeup, the daily necessities.`
` ...The needs of a woman aren't simple.`
` ......Would it be possible to maintain all of that without any of the family or the servants noticing?"`
`".........When you say it that way, it sure sounds like a weak point in our theory.`
` ...But that isn't enough to get rid of my feeling that Father might have been able to do it anyway.`
` After all, it's our Father."`
`"That's right.`
` ...It's our Father."`
`"If Father had something he wanted to succeed in, he would succeed no matter what.`
` ...Saying that it would be difficult for a normal person and is therefore impossible, doesn't apply when it comes to Father."`
`"Hmm.`
` You should never underestimate Father.`
` ......Father's madness can't be understood by normal people."`
`I wouldn't put it past 'that' Kinzo.`
`...As long as you stick to this phrase, a considerable amount of credibility can dwell in any absurd story.`
` However, that didn't cause the importance of what Kyrie had said to waver.`
` This was different from stealthily raising a kitten in a cardboard box and keeping it a secret from your parents.`
` Taking care of a person in secret over a period of 30 years would be an incalculably massive task...`
`"......Because Father's Legend of the Gold started before he gained possession of Rokkenjima.`
` That would mean that his relationship with his mistress was over thirty years long... `
`How old would that make her?`
` In the worst case, she could be as old as us or older, right?`
`...By that age, the body starts to break down.`
` I don't care what the mansion's like, I couldn't call livin' in a place where people's eyes can't reach, almost as though she were under house arrest, agreeable..."`
`"That's right.`
` ...If what Father told us about Beatrice is true, then that relationship has lasted for over 30 years. `
`......She might have been a charming young woman at the time, but it is probably appropriate to think that she's now an old bag like us.`
` I can easily imagine that, given the contents of that letter."`
`"You should talk.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`Krauss laughed, as though blind to his own shortcomings.`
` Of course, Eva was offended, but she didn't strike back.`
`"Quit it, Aniki.`
` ......So if everything we imagine is true, then she should throw out her chest with pride and join in on Father's inheritance problem. `
`Anyway, ...there's a good chance that this love was mutual, unlike with Mother.`
` Father himself might have been aware that she was his mistress, and yet at the same time, he might have been proud of her as though she were his real wife."`
`".........That is an insult to Mother."`
`"Yeah, sorry. `
`...However, everyone knows that it was a political marriage decided by the elders among his relatives.`
` ...Because of that, we can be sure that it wouldn't be odd for Father to have a mistress."`
`The family sank after the Great Kanto Earthquake, and Father was set up as the Ushiromiya family head against his will.`
` However, in the beginning, the elder relatives treated Kinzo like a dummy and had a strong influence on him, almost like he was a puppet.`
` He wasn't permitted to decide anything by himself, not even his marriage partner...`
`......Since the time he met that Golden Witch Beatrice in those distant days,`
` Kinzo's Legend of the Gold was quickly embellished into something dramatic.`
` In other words, `
`...it could mean, `
`that Kinzo really did meet with a woman he loved.`
` If she also knew the whole story, `
`even if they weren't marriage partners, it wouldn't have been odd for her to consider herself his true wife, inside her heart.`
`...And now, the person registered as his true wife was already dead...`
`"...In which case, she might feel confident encroaching in on not just the rights to his assets, but the battle over the inheritance as well."`
`".........I see.`
` I'm starting to see the purpose of this letter.`
` The inheritance for the one who solves the riddle of the epitaph...`
` Is that what it means...?"`
`"Even if that mistress was added into the family ranking system, since she is not a direct relative of Father, she would be inferior to even the children. `
`...In other words, she would be right below Rosa in rank.`
` That's not a good position to join the battle for the inheritance."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...If someone can solve the witch's riddle, they will receive the inheritance regardless of rank.`
` In other words, it is the most advantageous condition that Beatrice could get, since she has nothing to do with this."`
`The revival of the Ushiromiya family had been made possible by the gold Beatrice had bestowed.`
`...That was quite a distinguishing service she had provided.`
` She had built that wealth together with Kinzo, so it was natural that she would have thought of herself as the one who should inherit it...`
` It would also be natural for her to despise the thought of giving that up to the children of the wife Kinzo had never loved.`
`"D, don't say something so shameless...!`
` Even if a mistress actually existed, joining in on the battle for the rights to the head's inheritance would be a reckless action far above her place!`
` What disregard for her own place...!"`
`Natsuhi turned red, her fist quivering.`
`...She had also come into the Ushiromiya register due to complicated circumstances.`
` Those who knew that understood more or less why she was so angry for the sake of Kinzo's dead wife.`
`"...Well, thanks to her reckless action, we now all have an even chance, right? `
`And also, Father has given that reckless action his silent approval.`
` ......Will the person who succeeds the Ushiromiya family be his mistress Beatrice, or one of us, the relatives he doesn't love?`
` Maybe he wants to make us struggle over that to see who is worthy."`
`As Eva giggled roguishly, Krauss shrugged his shoulders and looked away.`
`"......However, since it was the other party that brought up this condition, `
`I wonder if that means that the other party has a significant advantage."`
`"Th, that's right.`
` ...In the first place, if Beatrice meant that letter literally, then she's Father's alchemist.`
` In other words, she's the manager of his gold.`
` It wouldn't be strange at all if she knew where it was hidden, would it?! `
`Isn't that cruel?`
` It's like she's telling us a riddle that she knows the answer to!`
` She'll probably show up rudely, say 'Hey, here's the answer, I'll take the inheritance now',`
` and snatch everything away from us!"`
`".....................`
`...That's right. `
`The person who brings up a riddle always knows the answer.`
` There's a good chance that this is all a trap to steal everything from us."`
`"...If you think about it like that, don't you start to doubt whether she really had any gold in the first place?`
` Why would she tell us about it?`
` All she'd have to do would be stay silent and embezzle it."`
`"It really is,`
` ...a strange story."`
`That was certainly the case.`
` If the epitaph showed the way to where the gold was hidden, why would she challenge them to try and solve it?`
` If they actually did solve it, wouldn't the gold all be stolen...? `
`Could it be that this person was trying to stir the siblings up so that they tried to solve the epitaph,`
` and would then snatch it up before they did solve it...?`
` That was a very reasonable guess.`
`"............No, `
`if you turn the chessboard over, there might be a pretty good chance that they actually do have the gold."`
`"Why are you so certain?"`
`"...Wait, Aneki. `
`......Kyrie, please keep talking.`
` Why do you think that?"`
`"After all, do they really think that we would give up the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family, `
`just because someone told us the answer to the riddle in the witch's epitaph?`
` That we'd be so impressed at the answer to the riddle that we'd just give up?"`
`"......Well, `
`......that's true.`
` They wouldn't be so naive to assume that we would give up after being told the answer to the riddle, `
`that we'd just say 'Here you go' and hand it over."`
`"Of course.`
` The inheritance of the Ushiromiya family is not something that can be handed over so easily!"`
`"That's it exactly.`
` No matter how one-sided a game Beatrice proposes, even if she splendidly shows us the answer,`
` there's no way that we'll obediently hand over the inheritance.`
` ......So as long as this game isn't on an even footing, unless they have some kind of compelling force,`
` the game won't succeed."`
`"That's right. `
`......Unless the inheritance is handed over by the losers because of a compelling force, this game won't succeed."`
`"And what would this compelling force be?`
` Would they bind us in chains and threaten us into handing over the inheritance?"`
`".........I see.`
` I get it.`
` ......They would just have to do something which would make us willingly give up the inheritance. `
`I see.`
` ...To do that, Beatrice would have to own 10 tons of gold...!"`
`"R, really, I get it too! `
`In other words, ...it's a trade?!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh, what do you mean...?`
` A trade?`
` Trade what?!"`
`"The Ushiromiya family inheritance for the hidden gold.`
` ...Beatrice surely plans to tell us the location of the 10 tons of gold, and use that as a bribe to gain the Ushiromiya family inheritance."`
`"R, ridiculous!!"`
`"They want to trade the inheritance of the glorious Ushiromiya family for, ...m, money?!`
` Blasphemy!!`
` Blasphemy against the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"......Listen without getting mad.`
` ...About how much wealth does this glorious Ushiromiya family have right now?`
` Are we really that affluent?"`
`"Th, the definition of affluence is not dependent on property.`
` It is about heart!`
` Our financial situation has nothing to-"`
`Krauss interrupted Natsuhi as she started to go on and on emotionally.`
` In this situation, the more she went on and on emotionally, the worse it would actually sound.`
`"......Other than me, I've heard that the rest of you are in pretty unfavorable situations right now."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I've heard that your financial situation was extremely unfavorable. `
`Repeatedly exchanging collateral for new money to gamble with.`
` Repeatedly dabbling in new gambles, unable to accept your losses.`
` ...Considering our actual state of affairs, none of us are as impoverished as you, Nii-san.`
` You've suffered massive losses, Nii-san. `
`You have no talent!"`
`"W, who are you saying has no talent?!!`
` And impoverished, you say?!!"`
`Natsuhi became indignant once again, but Krauss raised his hand again and interrupted her.`
`"......It seems you are making a small mistake.`
` Business is not something that can be judged based simply on progress.`
` For someone with a long-term outlook on business such as myself,`
` it may sometimes appear at a glance that I have suffered some significant short-term losses."`
`"Aniki,`
` we've been collecting evidence.`
` Your position right now is not one to be proud of. `
`......So this is what Kyrie is trying to say.`
` ......Every one of us is in trouble with regards to money.`
` And Beatrice has 10 tons of gold."`
`"......As the only person who knows the location of the 10 tons of gold, Beatrice is planning on using it to force us to sell the inheritance.`
` ...About how much is 10 tons of gold worth? `
`As a rough estimate..., 2 billion yen?`
` .........No, 20 billion yen.`
` With that much piled up, we would be mad with joy and accept her as the next head."`
`The scene returned to silence.`
` Even the rain and the wind sounded louder.`
`...That was probably the sound of the windstorm that disturbed the insides of their minds...`
`"............Th, ...this isn't funny.`
` ...The thought that we'd give up the inheritance to some woman of doubtful origin..., `
`......just because they had a little money stored up......"`
`"Don't talk stupid...!`
` This wasn't even your inheritance in the first place, right...?!`
` We have nothin' to lose and money to gain.`
` We'll have to calculate our profit and loss, but it's somethin' worth listenin' to...!"`
`They knew that much of the Ushiromiya family assets had been eaten up by Krauss.`
` The dregs that remained of that inheritance, ...versus the 'compensation for being accepted as the head' that Beatrice would pay.`
` It was a shame, but honestly, the former was less enticing than the latter.`
`"...Well, it probably wouldn't end up as four equal portions.`
` Since Aniki would be giving up his position as the next head, his portion would have to be larger.`
` ...Makes me feel kinda jealous, you know?"`
`"........................"`
`"Dear...!`
` The amount of money isn't the problem, right?!`
` Your cowardly younger siblings are trying to sell the glory of the Ushiromiya family for money, right?!`
` Why aren't you displaying your dignity as the oldest son?!"`
`".........Natsuhi, `
`stay quiet for a while."`
`"Dear?!?!"`
`"......This is a dizzying proposal.`
` ......We were each planning on getting 250 million yen out of Aniki.`
` If the witch would treat us with ten percent of those ten tons..., `
`......ummm-"`
`"That's 2 billion."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That would means she's treating us with ten times our original goal.`
` That alone would be more than enough for us.`
` ......It's not like I have any attachment to the Ushiromiya name.`
` I'd be happy to sell it off..."`
`"Even if 10 tons might be a bit of an optimistic figure,`
` .........I see, it would still be a fascinating prospect for us.`
` ...We were trying to form an alliance among the siblings to kick this outsider called Beatrice out.`
`......But, if this is her plan, `
`......it will tear apart the unity between us.`
` ...Yes, by this point we can state it clearly.`
` ......The goal of Beatrice's letter was to disturb our alliance."`
`If the three younger siblings, who had never had anything to do with the inheritance,`
` were paid enough money to satisfy them, they would happily accept Beatrice as the next head.`
` A moat had been dug all around Krauss.`
` In that case, the negotiations would be one-on-one between her and Krauss.`
` He tried to look strong, but Krauss's financial and political situation was extremely weak.`
`...He did bluff in front of his siblings, but on the inside, he was thinking that it might be alright to enter negotiations depending on the sum of money involved.`
` In order to bury his losses, Krauss had taken advantage of the fact that Kinzo had shut himself up in his room, and had embezzled Kinzo's personal assets.`
` Therefore, when Kinzo died and the inheritance was distributed, Krauss' own responsibilities would doubtlessly be investigated.`
` But if he gave up his seat as the head to Beatrice, `
`she would also receive rights to the assets, and as a result, the distribution of the inheritance to the siblings would not occur.`
`......In other words, Krauss' embezzlement might not have to be made known to the other siblings...`
` Of course, the siblings were frightened of Kinzo, but it was doubtful whether they still actually respected him as a father.`
` By this time, they each had their own families, their own wealth, and their own lives.`
` If they were paid enough money in exchange for Rokkenjima, the wreckage of Kinzo's dreams,`
` ......there was a significant possibility that they would relinquish the Ushiromiya family name......`
` In other words, Beatrice's victory was already guaranteed in this 'game'.`
` Not as the winner of 'Beatrice's game', `
`...but as the winner of 'Kinzo's game'.`
`...Kinzo once ordered that the epitaph be displayed.`
` And until today, no one has solved it.`
` So Beatrice 'solved' it.`
` In other words, this is less of a game and more like Beatrice's declaration of victory...`
` However, Kyrie still thought there might be a catch.`
` If this was a declaration of victory, Beatrice would only have to display the gold openly, and state that she would buy the inheritance.`
` And yet, she had gone to all of this trouble, telling the siblings to try and solve the epitaph.`
` And why had she set up this 'new game', where she agreed to hand over the all of the gold and the inheritance to the person who solved the epitaph? `
`Kyrie tried turning the chessboard over several times.`
`...Searching for the best strategy that might have guided Beatrice to this line of thinking.`
`...In the end, ...she reached a single conclusion.`
`"............Could it be, `
`...arrogance?`
` Or maybe, `
`......she's playing......?"`
`"...What are you talking about?"`
`"The witch sent us a letter of challenge, forcing us to try and solve the epitaph.`
` She might be taking us lightly, thinking we could never solve it.`
` ......However, there should be at least an extremely small chance that we will solve it.`
` After all, we have here four of Father's children by blood, right?`
` The questioner called together four blood relatives who, if they tried frantically to work together and avoid having those assets stolen from them,`
` might come across the answer of the riddle by chance."`
`The reason the witch had a superior position on the negotiations compared to the siblings was that only she knew the location of the hidden gold.`
` But if that hiding place was exposed to someone other than her, the witch's superior position would crumble.`
`"In short, Beatrice gains nothing but risk by writing this witch's letter of challenge. `
`......Of course, it might have had the effect of splitting apart the siblings' alliance,`
` but if that was her only goal, why would she take this risk, however slight it might be......?`
` I think that's reckless.`
`...But if you keep in mind a certain type of emotion, it becomes possible to understand that risk."`
`"...............`
`...And you're saying that's arrogance?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......When people have an overwhelming advantage, they tend to get arrogant.`
` And when they do, they want to show off that advantage to the losers, so they sometimes take on a small risk.`
` ......A moderate amount of risk adds a little spice to the joy of victory.`
` It'd be boring to win without any risk."`
`"............I understand.`
` I also like that sort of thing.`
` ...I understand well."`
`"I thought of a few plausible explanations for the true motive behind Beatrice's letter,`
` ......but I think that this really might be the truth.`
` ......The emotion hidden behind that letter was, `
`.........arrogance."`
`"............Arrogance."`
`"She's trying to throw her weight around, looking down on us, as if there's no way we could figure out such a difficult epitaph.`
` ...It might even be possible, if surprising, that the epitaph wasn't written by Father, but by her."`
`"......Sounds great.`
` ......Solve the riddle of the epitaph, she says?"`
`If only I solved it, I would be made the head, right...?`
`...I'll solve it...`
` I'll accept the witch's challenge.`
` As if those other idiot siblings could solve it.`
` I'll solve it by myself, and then I'll prove that I am the one who is fit to succeed the Ushiromiya family......`
`"I'll take that challenge.`
` ......I will, `
`......solve the riddle......"`
