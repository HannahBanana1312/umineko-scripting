`"My, my,`
` what a shame that Aneki hates cigarettes so much."`
`"Sorry.`
` She's been grumpy since last night.`
` Would you mind ignoring it?"`
`Rudolf and Hideyoshi went out onto the deck, and took out some cigarettes.`
` Eva had always hated the smell of cigarettes, but when she was in a bad mood, she got even more oversensitive.`
` When they had decided to spend the time until they reached the island smoking casually, the two of them had been threatened and chased out onto the deck.`
` Hideyoshi tried to use his lighter, but it didn't go well with all of the strong winds on the deck.`
` Rudolf took out a Zippo with a stylish gesture, and let Hideyoshi borrow the flame.`
`"When did you start smoking cigarettes, Hideyoshi nii-san?"`
`"Just after the war.`
` In the beginnin', I was rollin' 'em. `
`Then I started usin' what I was sellin'.`
` Wahahahahahahaha."`
`"So you were already smoking when you met Aneki.`
` I'll bet she's always telling you to stop."`
`"I never listened to her, so she's already completely given up on that.`
` Wahaha, looks like men have got to be stubborn."`
`Hideyoshi laughed heartily, but Rudolf chuckled.`
` After they had been scolded by Eva, they had dejectedly ran out onto the deck together.`
` They had almost certainly been dominated by her.`
`"...She isn't usually so short-tempered.`
` ......Nah, she's usually a more gentle, quiet woman.`
` Every year, she changes when this day comes."`
`"Is that so?`
` To me, she looks just like the Aneki we've all known for so long."`
`"......That's right.`
` She's returned to bein' Eva of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...But, that's different from the Eva who's with me."`
`"..................`
` Well, I can understand why she's grumpy.`
` ...This family conference is going to be a pain."`
`"......Very true.`
` ...That plan to threaten money out of Krauss nii-san.`
` Even though we call it a family conference, it's really just a fight between the siblings."`
`Before the family conference, three of the siblings had made a secret contract without Krauss.`
` The situation that pressed at all of them was an urgent need for a lot of money.`
` And the only one who could help them was Krauss, who spoke for the Ushiromiya head, since Kinzo was shut up in his study.`
` Since long ago, they had felt that Krauss was taking advantage of Kinzo's loss of interest in his own wealth,`
` and had started embezzling that wealth for his own use.`
` When everything had been going well for the siblings, even though they had found it detestable, they had pretended not to notice,`
` ...but now that they needed money, they couldn't just quietly accept that.`
` Eva had called Rudolf and Rosa into an alliance, and they had schemed to take that money away from Krauss.`
`".........Rudolf-kun, both you and I are company presidents.`
` We are responsible for the livelihood of our employees."`
`"Rosa is a president too.`
` Well, as a hobby."`
`"That's right, sorry. `
`......In short, all of us are bearin' some burden."`
`"...Now that I have thrown the gauntlet down in front of the executive board, I gotta bring in the money, even if it means I have to kneel or even drink mud."`
`"Same here.`
` ...I can't betray those employees who've trusted me and followed me for so long.`
` ......That's why I must get some money out of Krauss nii-san, even if I have to grab him by the neck."`
`"Aneki has always been at odds with Aniki.`
` ...And now she must oppose Aniki completely.`
` That's probably enough to make her grumpy."`
`"Just as I thought. So, Eva has always had a bad relationship with Krauss nii-san...?"`
`"Hasn't she talked about it?`
` It was so massive."`
`"She won't tell me about the past even if I ask.`
` She probably doesn't want to remember."`
`"...Aneki has always been smart and to the point.`
` Her grades were good too.`
` Compared to that, Aniki was just average.`
` ...Her just being there beside him should have been enough pressure, but Aneki kept boasting about it and driving Aniki into a corner."`
`"......That idiot...`
` Why did she drive him into a corner with that frank hostility?`
` That won't accomplish anythin'."`
`"Hahaha, seriously. `
`.........Aneki regrets being born a woman.`
` ...After all, she probably couldn't forgive Aniki, since it was decided that he would succeed the head just because he was a man.`
` ...So she would always boast to Father that she was superior at every little thing."`
`"Father really is an old-fashioned person.`
` His values discriminate between men and women. `
`...You think that Father disliked Eva a bit, since she likes to make herself conspicuous...?"`
`"....................."`
`"Don't you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` Without it, there's no taste, but too much of it ruins the tea."`
`...Since you can still drink black tea without sugar,`
` it was almost the same as saying that study was unnecessary for a woman.`
` Those infuriating words were ones that my older brother had abused me with when I had been in despair, when I had wanted to go to college but was rejected by Father.`
` I had protested that, as the oldest daughter in the Ushiromiya family, I needed to gain proper dignity and an education, so advancing to college was essential.`
` But, if you sum up Father's and brother's answers, they were both the same.`
`'How conceited for a woman.'`
`Since the time I was born into the Ushiromiya family, I hadn't taken that name lightly even once.`
` And furthermore, I also hadn't ever taken Father's name, Ushiromiya Kinzo, lightly even once.`
` It was an old family with many traditions, but in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it had lost its wealth and its business, and had sunk all at once.`
` Then Father, with his ingenious talent, had taken control, and revived it to be even greater than it had been before.`
` I hadn't forgotten that I was the daughter of that great Ushiromiya Kinzo even once.`
` Therefore, I had always made every effort to become worthy of that name.`
` Dignity worthy of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Schooling.`
` Manners.`
` And leadership.`
` Even if I couldn't quite reach Father's level, I deepened my knowledge in economics and finance, and tried to improve myself so that I could help out with that at any time.`
`......However, in the end, Father never accepted that.`
` To Father, a woman was only meant to support a man, and nothing further than that was permissable.`
` I probably understood that.`
`......I had probably understood that since I was a young girl.`
`...But to truly accept that, I had to wait until I had grown up.`
` You couldn't have said that Krauss, as my older brother by two years, `
`tried at all to become deserving of the Ushiromiya family name, and his effort was pathetic compared to mine.`
` Since we were young, my brother kept saying that it was natural that he'd succeed Father, just because he was born a man.`
`...He kept repeating that, as though it were an absolute gap between us.`
` I couldn't stand it.`
` Even though I always got better grades than my brother,`
` even though while he was stuck as vice-president of his class, I became class president,`
` ...even so, my brother was considered to be the appropriate person to succeed the Ushiromiya family just because he was a man.`
` Of course, you could get away with gender discrimination in those days.`
` No, it was even considered a virtue in those days.`
` It was a despicable time. People said that, when a woman is born, they obey their parents, when they get married, they obey their husbands, and when they get old, they obey their children.`
` But because that way of thinking existed, I wanted to overturn it.`
`......Innocently, I kept trying to prove that I was the most fit.`
`......However, eventually, I realized that all of my efforts were doomed from the beginning.`
`"Don't you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?`
` Without it, there's no taste, but too much of it ruins the tea."`
`"...What do you mean by that, Nii-san?"`
`"Just like how there are things that only men can do, there are things that only women can do, right?`
` I think things like giving birth to children, raising them, and supporting their husband can only be done by women."`
`"Are you trying to say that there's no need for a woman to do things like work and study?"`
`"I wouldn't go that far.`
` It's tiring just talking with an unschooled woman.`
` ...However, women who are too smart are even more tiring.`
` I think that a woman like you, who violently asserts herself, would cause their future husband a lot of trouble."`
`"Are you trying to say that a woman must marry and stay in the shadow of their husband? `
`That's none of your business!"`
`"I admire you as my little sister for feeling that you should respect Father and become a proper daughter for him.`
` Even I can respect that."`
`"That's just disgusting.`
` What is this '{c:86EF9C:watashi}'?`
` Even though you always used to use '{c:86EF9C:ore}'.`
` Are you already pretending to be the head?"`
`"It was decided that 'I (watashi)' would succeed the head from the beginning.`
` Even so, you seem to be laboring under the illusion that you can become the head, and have just been making useless and reckless attempts to do that."`
`"Reckless attempts, you say...?!`
` Is my saying that I want to go to college really that odd?!"`
`"Yes, it's odd.`
` You are surely the oldest daughter of the glorious Ushiromiya family.`
` Eventually, you will bear the family seal, and be wed to a partner who is most valuable for Father.`
` ...However, what is asked from you is not excess learning.`
` It is gentle feelings to care for your husband and ability in housework, and it is a humble demeanor that will support the master of your household.`
` You are completely lacking in all of those things.`
` In the end, is that really proper for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"I have no intention of being a secluded daughter!`
` I just want to become the best person who can help Father with his work!"`
`"And isn't that improper for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family...?`
` What is it with you?`
` Even at this age, you still act like a man, you are careless with housework and cooking, and you never wear any makeup to please men.`
` I've heard that you've even been training to learn how to brawl."`
`"Th, that's rude!! `
`It isn't brawling, the martial arts are the perfect training for the mind.`
` And at the proper time, I can act like a woman well enough!!`
` What are you trying to say?`
` That women are slaves who work for men, so don't come outside uninvited, is that what you're trying to say?!"`
`"It isn't elegant to accept that,`
` but in order to correct your mistake, I think that a few unpleasant words are necessary.`
` So let me say it plainly.`
` Women exist to serve men.`
` And men exist to cultivate women.`
` A woman's job is to protect a man's back, to protect their house and raise their children.`
` Normally, they don't have to be told that to realize it.`
` They realize it by themselves.`
` ...But no matter how old you get, you haven't realized that about yourself.`
` So I will clear away that misunderstanding for you before you exit this house into society.`
` You should thank me."`
`"A, all of that is an insult to women...!!`
` No, wait, ...I, I have never thought of myself as a woman, I've never depended on anyone because I'm a woman!!`
` How am I inferior to you, Nii-san?!`
` In grades and accomplishments, in everything, I'm better, so how can you look down on me when you don't have anything I don't, except being a man?!!"`
`"It's about whether or not you know your place.`
` Every day, I have been raised so that I would be prepared to be the next head.`
` In the future, that will definitely be essential.`
` But you are different.`
` Even though you will marry and lose the Ushiromiya family name, you keep seeing this illusion that you don't need to see.`
`......What's so unsatisfying about that?`
` Even if you were born as a man, you still probably couldn't succeed the head.`
` What's so unsatisfying that you keep attacking me?"`
`"What's so unsatisfying, you say?!?!`
` Nii-san, you are always, always, `
`......always always always...!`
` Looking down on me because you will succeed the head, `
`......and despite that..., `
`......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!"`
`What's so unsatisfying, you say...? `
`A billion things are. Grudges, hard feelings, humiliations that I'll never forget kept floating through the back of my mind.`
` And all of them built up at the same time, coming out of my throat as a shameful moan.`
`"......What is all this noise. `
`God isn't the only one who values silence."`
`"Father."`
`"Father!"`
`Our sibling fight was probably overheard.`
` Father entered with a clearly unhappy face.`
`"Krauss.`
` Are you fighting with your siblings again?`
` Why don't you have the dignity to lead your siblings? `
`How shameful!`
` I'm shocked to hear that from my eldest son!"`
`In a flash, he struck Krauss's face.`
`...I prepared myself to be struck in the same way, but I wasn't hit.`
`"M, ......my apologies, `
`Father."`
`"Dignity isn't the only thing that you lack.`
` There's much more.`
` You're immature in everything!`
` And even so, you pretend like you're an adult!`
` Realize that it's a hundred years too early for you to talk like that, and devote yourself to your studies!`
` Don't make me lament my son's incompetence any more...!"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I will continue to strive so that I can become a person worthy to succeed you, Father..."`
`It was as if those words were directed at me.`
` Even when he was being yelled at by Father, he was still bragging to me about how he was special, `
`......about how he was the successor.`
` I just couldn't stand it, and finally spoke what was on my mind.`
` Even though I realized that this was improper for a person of the Ushiromiya family.`
`"Father...!!`
` Please tell me, how am I inferior?!!`
` Until today I've tried so hard, studied so hard to become a person who would not shame Father's name...!`
` Please, tell me, in what way am I inferior...?!`
` How can I improve myself so that Father will accept me...!!"`
`"Are you still talking about that?!! `
`How many times do I have to say it before you'll understand?`
` What you're expecting is nothing at all!`
` A woman should just learn cooking and sewing, like a woman!!`
` You aren't prepared at all as a woman!`
` I can't sense any of the disposition needed to serve a man, the heart to devote yourself to a man!! `
`What good are you as a woman!`
` Do you realize that you are a daughter of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` And yet, you only want to learn things so that you can act like a man!`
` Your duty is not to act like Krauss!!`
` Do you even understand your own duty?!!"`
`"A, as a person of the Ushiromiya family, I won't embarrass Father's na-"`
`"That's it, right there you're already wrong!!`
` Your duty is to marry out of the family, and bring me a man who is profitable to me!`
` And then devote yourself to your husband, give birth to children and increase in number!`
` Be a good wife who brings praise to your husband's family!! `
`Can't you do anything to please a man?`
` Do you think you can make tea?`
` Do you have any talent in cooking?`
` You have nothing!!`
` All you have done is to try and act like Krauss, right?!!`
` Krauss will succeed the Ushiromiya family!`
` If you are unsatisfied with that, then you are disobeying me!! `
`Are you saying that you won't even listen to what I say, even though you're my daughter!!! `
`Get out!!`
` You're disinherited!!`
` I won't let you be called Ushiromiya!!`
` Disinherited disinherited!! `
`Uu-, *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, hang in there.`
` Please calm down. `
`......Genji-san, could you bring some water?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Immediately."`
`"Eva, leave this place.`
` He's not in his right mind.`
` I will calm him down."`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! `
`Disinherited, if you won't listen to me, you're disinherited!! `
`*cough**cough*, uu-, *cough**cough*!!"`
`Father was choking pretty bad, and my brother patted his back.`
`...As if that were naturally his duty.`
` It was so vexing for me then to let him monopolize that duty.`
` If I carelessly approached Father now, I would probably be hit again.`
`...However, I fearlessly tried to approach Father's back.`
` Genji blocked me...`
`"......Eva-sama, it would probably be better if you stepped outside for now.`
` The Master is not in a good mood today."`
`"B, but......"`
`"*cough*cough*!! `
`Why are my children so incompetent?!`
` Krauss is lacking in dignity, Eva is always a stubborn tomboy!!`
` I have no son who's like a man, and not even a daughter who's like a woman!`
` Where did I go wrong raising them?!`
` Why Genji, when and where did I go wrong?!!"`
`"......Master hasn't done anything wrong.`
` Krauss-sama has grown into a sturdy son, and Eva-sama into a lovely daughter.`
` You haven't made any mistakes..."`
`"How can you say that?!! `
`What's so lovely about her?!!`
` Far from a lady, she's always acting like a man!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!! `
`Disinherited, disinherite-d!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`"Father, that's just what I'm always telling Eva.`
` Eva has promised that she would have a change of heart and act like a lady.`
` Couldn't you postpone that for just a little longer?"`
`"Who's a lady?!!`
` *cough*cough*!!`
` Disinherited disinherited..., *cough*cough, uu-, *cough*cough*!"`
`Go quickly and leave this place to me.`
` Krauss gave me a look telling me that...`
`......Did I take the wrong path, just like Father and my brother had said? `
`Of course, I had never learned how to be a lady.`
`...Everything I had learned was because I'd hoped that I could help Father someday.`
`.........Wait, was that really the case? `
`Didn't I always hold a growing sense of rivalry with my brother, with whom I'd had a bad relationship since I was a young girl,`
` and want to take advantage of his weaknesses and steal his position as successor to the head? `
`Every time, my brother told me that men should be manly and women should be womanly.`
` I was tormented by this unreasonable discrimination because of one's sex, something one was born with and couldn't do anything about.`
` I had resisted, had endeavored to study until today so that I could prove that I wasn't inferior, even though I was a woman.`
`...In that case, wasn't the basis of my love of learning just a boring complex against my brother? `
`Father had expected me to be a lady with whom he could go out in public and not be embarrassed.`
`...Had I betrayed that expectation and earned grades to threaten my brother just to clear away that pent up resentment...?`
`"That's not it.`
` You swore to me, saying 'I will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family'."`
`".........You........."`
`The one who came up to me, whispering, .........was the me of my days as a young girl, who had been born inside my heart on the day that I swore that.`
`...That's right.`
` 'She' was my only ally.`
` When things got difficult, when I felt broken, she would always quietly appear and become my ally.`
` When I stumbled over difficulties, and was greatly troubled, she would always appear and support me.`
` As I had grown and forgotten my time as a girl, I'd also begun to forget my conversations with 'her'...`
`"I, Ushiromiya Eva, will definitely become the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And I'll triumph over that irritating, arrogant Krauss.`
` ...On that day, we promised to do our best together to achieve that."`
`"......That's right, we promised.`
` ...On that day, that I would become the successor to the head."`
`On that day, when I had been overcome with sadness, wondering why I was even alive,`
` ...you appeared inside me, and lent me your strength.`
`"......I wasn't accepted by Father.`
` I wanted to take advantage of Nii-san's weakness.`
` I believed that, if I could do that, I could distinguish my wretched self."`
`In those days, I had really believed that my life had no purpose other than to be looked down upon by my brother.`
`...It's painful just remembering those days.`
` The fate that went into my heart and tore a hole in me...`
`'She' had taught me how to sew up that wound...`
` I had changed my anger into effort and improved myself,`
` ......to become a person more worthy to be head than Krauss was,`
` and to triumph over him by making Father accept me. The perfect revenge.`
` I knew more or less that a woman couldn't succeed the head.`
` But maybe, if I tried to become so superior that I could overturn that,`
` ...then surely even Father would select me to be his successor.`
` If that happened, ......then I could have the greatest and most perfect revenge against my brother, `
`who always acted like it was completely natural for him to succeed the head...`
`"Right.`
` If we do that, then the wounds in our heart will be healed.`
` ......We promised each other that we would do our best until that day comes. `
`And yet, you're breaking this promise?`
` Scum.`
` Coward.`
` Why don't you just {c:86EF9C:give up and die}...?"`
`Even though she had the form of my young self, she was another me.`
` ...Anyway, since she was me, she had a sharp tongue.`
`"...It really makes me mad hearing that from myself.`
` You have no right to speak of me like that."`
`"Then let's use that anger and learn from it.`
` ......Changing anger into power is my magic.`
` I've saved you from several predicaments with that power, and allowed you to succeed where you shouldn't have succeeded.`
` As long as you have my magic, there's nothing you can't do."`
`"......That's right.`
` Anger has always been my driving force.`
` I wonder when it was that I forgot that..."`
`"If you can remember me again, that magic will become ours once more.`
` Come on, let's turn that anger into power, and endeavor in our studies even more, alright?`
` I'm sure that we still need to study a lot more.`
` Let's go to college, study more and more, get excellent grades, and drive Krauss into a corner. `
`That guy makes a face as though we're nothing, but I'm sure he feels pretty well cornered in his heart.`
` If only he would just learn his place and die.`
` If he did, we could become the head.`
` Rudolf would just refuse.`
` That kid can't go against us."`
`".........Stop that.`
` ...Even if I study more, Father still won't accept me."`
`"Why...?"`
`"Father told me to be womanly...`
` No matter how hard I try, as long as I'm a woman, even if I had been born before Nii-san, Father wouldn't pass on the headship to me...`
` No matter how much effort I put in, ......I can't become anything more than a woman.`
` I won't be accepted.`
` I can't surpass Nii-san, who doesn't try at all.`
` I will always be looked down upon..."`
`"...Father and Krauss are the worst kind of male supremacists.`
` If only they'd just die."`
`......She cursed them for my sake.`
` Words that I couldn't say carelessly, ...she said for me.`
` Even though I understood that she was just another part of myself inside of me,`
` ...I felt like she was the only ally I had who could sympathize with me.`
` However, while sympathy could calm my heart significantly, it wouldn't do anything to improve my current situation.`
` ......In the end, she could only console me when I was dejected by reality, and when I needed to accept it.`
`"......Thank you.`
` That's good enough.`
` ...Now that it's come to this, I'll become such a good lady that I'll surprise Father...`
` I'll find an excellent man that Nii-san can't even be compared with..."`
`"You can't do that."`
`"............"`
`'She' rejected my timid thoughts.`
`...I understand.`
` ......Because 'she' is me, I understand.`
`"Father said that he won't let a woman succeed the head 'now'.`
` But that's never been anything more than a rule that Father decided on.`
` Since Father decided on it, he can reject it.`
`.........People's feelings can change many more times than there are grains of sand on a beach.`
` Even if we don't prove that Krauss is a stupid man, Father will eventually realize it.`
` ...At that time, the wall that separates man from woman will be demolished by Father, who set it up in the first place.`
` That day will surely come."`
`"......How can you say surely?"`
`"That is my, ...magic."`
`"..............."`
`"If you'll just believe, this magic will surely create a miracle.`
` ......The basis of my magic is nothing more than your believing heart."`
`"....................."`
`If I can use that magic, ......then surely, until I die, I won't have to doubt that the day will come when I will become the head.`
`...But I don't know if that is the right thing for Ushiromiya Eva...`
` Shouldn't I aim to become the kind of woman that Father hoped for, someone he can take out into society and boast about? `
`Father might take a better view of me if I were reborn.`
` ......Maybe my brother could find his own lifestyle, and I could find mine.`
` No matter what, I can't imagine that my stubborn father would allow a woman to succeed the head,`
` would even push aside my brother to select me.`
`".........You don't believe?"`
`"U, ...um, I was just thinking.`
` .........Maybe I can't succeed the head, but, as a woman, I can have a child. And Nii-san still isn't engaged.`
` ......If Nii-san wasn't able to have children, and I could, ...then wouldn't the next head after Nii-san be my child?`
` In other words, ...wouldn't that mean the same thing as stealing the headship from Nii-san...?"`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"Y, ...yes. I'm serious.`
` ......It will indeed be quite sad to throw away the determination from my years as a young girl.`
` ...It will pain my heart to betray you, my younger self.`
` ......But this way is the most realistic...!"`
` `
` `
` `
`"Are you throwing away your dreams?`
` ......And are you even throwing me away?"`
`"I'm not throwing anything away.`
` ......It's just that I've become an adult, and I'm different from you now."`
`"That's right.`
` Eva's already become an adult.`
` She's even forgotten how to use magic.`
` ......She is now the mother of a single child.`
` She's forgotten the magic that can grant her own dreams, and is now pushing those dreams onto her son.`
`...Even though Father and Krauss made your own life so chaotic, you're trying to push your dreams onto your son, and make his life chaotic too.`
` ......Is that what you call being an adult?"`
`"G, George is a confident son who won't embarrass himself no matter where he goes...!`
` The dream that wasn't granted me might be granted to George...!`
` Jessica's grades and behavior aren't good at all.`
` And she's a woman!`
` If only Jessica would step down, George would become the heir...!"`
`It was very painful to say it.`
` Am I just forcing my own regrets onto George? `
`Jessica hasn't done anything to be scorned for.`
` Wasn't I just horrible for hitting her with the same words that had caused me so much suffering...?`
`...I understand.`
` I understand...`
` Wanting to triumph over my brother was nothing more than my revenge.`
`...I couldn't use George for that...`
`"......So I'll take revenge myself.`
` I have a plan to cheat Nii-san out of some of his money, with Rudolf and Rosa as my allies.`
` I'll surely be able to get back at him.`
` ...In any case, I'm sure that Nii-san is embezzling Father's assets..."`
`"...What a boring plan.`
` Why don't you just give up and cry yourself to sleep...?"`
`"....................."`
`"We will become the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Don't try to confuse that dream.`
` Therefore, believe in me, so that your dream will definitely be realized.`
` Believe in my magic."`
`"...If I believe, I wonder if the magic will have any power."`
`"Yes.`
` My magic can definitely grant any wish."`
`"...............`
`......I'll believe.`
` ......I'll believe, ...so create a miracle with that magic...`
`......If you don't, ......the hole in my heart will never heal......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Then listen well.`
` Listen to my magic words.`
` ......And then understand. If we can solve the riddle, we can become the Ushiromiya family head.`
` ......So lend me your ears and listen carefully..."`
`My beloved hometown, the bountiful river running through it.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key......`
`"Eva nee-san.`
` It looks like we're about to arrive."`
`When Kyrie shook her shoulders, Eva jumped and awoke from her doze.`
`".........eh.`
` .........Ah, `
`......I'm sorry. `
`I was half asleep."`
`"Sorry for surprising you."`
`"Eva oba-san, you were out cold.`
` Did you get up early this morning?"`
`"......Ah, well.`
` I showed you all something embarrassing.`
` I'm sorry."`
`"Although it's nice that you had enough spare time to be able to sleep, right? `
`Battler kept saying 'We're gonna fa-ll, we're gonna dro-wn!'.`
` Can't get bored with this guy around."`
`"Sh, shut up!`
` All humans have at least one thing that they're bad at...!"`
`Battler and Jessica came in, messing around.`
` Rudolf also made a face as if asking, 'Are you alright?'.`
`"Get a hold of yourself.`
` When you see the faces of Father and the rest, all that sleepiness'll go right out the window.`
` Let's do our best to stay firm, alright?"`
`"...That's right.`
` We have to stay firm, especially this year..."`
`"That's it.`
` ...Let's all tense up our assholes and go."`
`Rudolf said these strict words in a small voice that only Eva could hear.`
` Failure would not be tolerated in this year's family conference.`
`......All of their companies were hanging in the balance.`
` Even Rudolf's face looked a little tense.`
` Eva's expression probably looked tense as well.`
`"Mom, I have our luggage.`
` Let's go up onto the deck."`
`"...Thank you.`
` You sure are reliable, George."`
`"Why are you thanking me so suddenly?`
` It's not like you, Mother."`
`"Eva-, Geo-rge.`
` We've arrived.`
` Gather our luggage."`
`"Uu-!`
` Arrived, arrived!`
` Kya kya kya!"`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` You'll fall, so stop running!"`
`It seemed Maria was already getting excited.`
` She ran circles around Hideyoshi, escaping from Rosa, who was trying to catch her.`
`"....................."`
`"What is it, Mother? `
`...Do you feel sick...?"`
`"George.`
` Take the luggage and go on ahead.`
` Your mother's probably anemic, so I'll lend her a hand."`
`"Really...?`
` I understand, I'll go on ahead."`
`By looking at the strange appearance of Eva's expression, Hideyoshi realized that it had not been a pleasant awakening, and made George go on ahead.`
` Rudolf's family and Rosa's family also went up onto the deck, leaving only Eva and Hideyoshi inside the boat.`
` Eva had a vague expression on her face, as though she still hadn't been able to escape from her daydream.`
`"....................."`
`"...What's wrong?`
` Why the meek face?"`
`".........I wonder if I'm using George as a tool for my own revenge...`
`...I wonder if my childish hostility towards Nii-san has caused me to treat that child's life like a toy...`
` Aah, what have I done..., what have I......!"`
`"That isn't true.`
` George is our wonderful son, and he'll always perform admirably wherever he goes.`
` Eva, even if your expectations were a little mixed, everything's turned out alright in the end, hasn't it?! `
`Eva, you haven't done anything wrong.`
` To the contrary, George should thank you for strictly disciplinin' him, right?"`
`"...Really?`
` Hey, really?!`
` I wonder, does George think I'm a horrible mother...?!`
` Does he, does he does he does he?!"`
`"He's never said anythin' like that, not even once.`
` That's just your needless anxiety."`
`"Hideyoshi-sama.`
` Everyone has left the boat. `
`......Oh, did you drop something?`
` Shall I help you?"`
`Kumasawa had come to check on them when they hadn't gone up to the deck.`
` Hideyoshi hid Eva behind his back so that her expression couldn't be seen.`
`"Yeah, sorry.`
` My necktie pin just got a little crooked!`
` We're alright, and we'll be out in a second.`
` Wait outside for us!"`
`"Is that so?`
` ......Hoh-hoh-ho.`
` Then I will wait outside..."`
`Even though she didn't really understand, Kumasawa realized that something had come up, and disappeared so that she didn't trouble them further.`
` If they stayed here any longer, they would probably make everyone else worry too.`
`"...It's about time to go.`
` We'll make George and the rest worry."`
`"............Am I, ......really not despised by George......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Nothin' of the sort.`
` In fact, he's very grateful."`
`"........................"`
`"...Did you have a bad nightmare?`
` Again?"`
`"...............`
` Yes."`
`Hideyoshi knew that it wasn't rare for Eva to be tortured by nightmares.`
` And they would always become more striking on the days leading up to the family conference...`
` Hideyoshi knew that Eva's relationship with Krauss was still so full of antagonism that it could even be called trauma,`
` and that she still couldn't separate herself from the feelings she'd had as a child.`
`"That was a dream.`
` ...I'm with you now.`
` If I grasp your hand like this, that dream'll go away. `
`Right?`
` Look.`
` I'm holding tight."`
`"......*giggle*`
` That hurts.`
` ...Thank you.`
` I'm fine now...`
`...Let's get off the boat."`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's get off the boat.`
` Everyone's waitin' for us."`
`"...Umm, ............I'm sorry."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"......I'm sorry, `
`......that I yelled at you, `
`......about the smoke from your cigarettes just now......"`
`"Come on, you normally wouldn't apologize for that sort of thing.`
` ...You're all frail after havin' that dream.`
` ...Don't worry about it.`
` I was wrong for not realizin' that the smoke was affectin' you."`
`"............Have you, ...started to hate me...?"`
`"No way, no way.`
` Wahahahahahaha.`
` If I hated you after somethin' like that, we wouldn't have lasted three days.`
` Come on, stand up, stand up.`
` Let's get off the boat."`
`"Hideyoshi-sama, Eva-sama.`
` Is everything alright?`
` Are you not feeling well?"`
`This time, Gohda had come.`
` It looked like they had kept everyone waiting too long after all.`
` Eva also stood up without grumbling.`
`...She had to stop forcing her bad mood onto her husband and causing him any more trouble.`
`......Because that was probably what a 'good wife' would do.`
`"Is everything alright?`
` If you are worried about your health, shall I call Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Thanks.`
` I'm just a little anemic.`
` I'm alright now."`
`"It's a woman's disease.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` Wahhahahahahaha."`
`"Come on...`
` Don't say stuff like that in front of people, it's embarrassing."`
`"Oooh, sorry, sorry."`
`Eva elbowed Hideyoshi in the gut.`
` By that time, her normal expression had returned, which allowed Hideyoshi to relax a little.`
` It looked like the sunlight outside caused her to remember her giddiness.`
` A small plank was lowered to get off the boat, and Gohda was waiting there, smiling and ready to lend them a hand.`
`"Please, Eva-sama.`
` Your hand."`
`"Thank you."`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima."`
`{a:c: `
`Welcome back.}`
`"......Huh?"`
`When she left the boat, .........it seemed to Eva as though she had heard the voice of her young self saying welcome back.`
` No, it hadn't seemed that way.`
` ...Someone 'had told' her "Welcome back".`
` After becoming a shameless adult, `
`...the voice of her young self was distant.`
`"What am I living for......?`
` What can I do to release myself from this delusion......?"`
`Hideyoshi heard her talking to herself.`
` When Hideyoshi held on tightly to Eva's shoulders, just by his firmness, he communicated that there was no need to say anything more...`
` Maybe it was because the typhoon was getting closer.`
` The lively cries of the seagulls, which usually greeted them when they arrived, couldn't be heard at all...`
