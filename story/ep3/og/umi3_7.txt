`Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds.`
` There had never been anything on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family.`
` So checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose.`
` However, since Natsuhi had scolded that this was careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants' daily routine.`
`......The reason that Natsuhi had ordered this was the occasional disturbances of the witch.`
` Everyone who came and left this island knew about the legend of Beatrice, the witch of the forest.`
` This had become established as this island's characteristic ghost story.`
` Because of that, it was only natural that some people would say that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion..., `
`they would hear a strange sound or see the shadow of a person.`
` However, when that had created a little too big of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi's ears, `
`she had made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been entering and leaving.`
` Anyway, it was said that she had roused all of the servants and had them check throughout the mansion.`
` Because all of this uproar over the witch had happened before Gohda had come, `
`he had only heard about it from the more senior servants.`
` Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace.`
` They hadn't even been lacking`
` at the hotel or the restaurant Gohda had worked at.`
` So when he had heard that story on this island,`
` he had smiled bitterly, thinking 'ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all'.`
` He had smiled bitterly, but he had thought when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had not slighted that.`
` Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart he had thought it was a childish trick.`
` ......At first.`
`"............This certainly is eerie.`
` I see, I understand why servants got in an uproar over this in the past."`
`He could understand how someone doing the rounds on an eerie night like this `
`might believe they had seen a ghost if they `
`saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window which hadn't been closed.`
`"So, if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, there is a curse.`
` ......It seems that there was even a servant who received a serious injury and quit.`
` ...I'd hate to be injured.`
` I am already this old.`
` I probably wouldn't be granted a workplace this hospitable again...`
` Aaah.`
` Witch of the portrait.`
` I'm working sincerely, so please give me some peace."`
`Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine...`
` At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound.`
` The kitchen?`
` Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor? `
`Maybe a mouse or a cockroach had come out, and knocked over some of the dishes.`
` No, no, how could that be.`
` It was normally thoroughly cleaned! `
`Gohda thought he would check what that noise really had been and entered the kitchen.`
` He turned on the kitchen light.`
` When he did, he heard a strange sound.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`......To a cook like Gohda, that sound seemed like the lid on the pressure cooker or something was shaking.`
` Of course, it couldn't be in use when no one was in the kitchen.`
` If someone was using the gas, walking away from it would be quite dangerous.`
`...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range...`
`"............What is this...?"`
`When he did, in the corner by the gas range, `
`...the pressure cooker really had been set, just as he had thought.`
` But the flame wasn't on.`
`...And yet, the lid was clanking...`
` Was something fermenting and leaking gas?`
`...How could it be?`
` ......Then is there a mouse or something inside?`
`...How could there be, ridiculous...`
` In front of people, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build,`
` ......but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him.`
` He was frightened that there might be something inside, and he couldn't check it carelessly...`
` In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle,`
` and with a *clunk!* `
`he tapped it a little strongly against the side of the pressure cooker.`
` When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped.`
`...He should have been relieved now that it had stopped,`
` ...but the fact that it had stopped when he had hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside...`
`"............Hmm, ...*gulp*.`
` .........Strange phenomena do not exist in this world.`
` Yes, witches and magic, things like that couldn't exist.`
` All phenomena can be explained with science.`
` ......As though monsters and witches could exist...!"`
`He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence.`
`...It was quite comical how he looked completely different from what he was saying.`
`"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...`
`......Come on, `
`......show me what you really are...! `
`Take that!"`
`...He removed the lid of the pressure cooker.`
` And lying exposed there, `
`...was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot.`
`......There was absolutely nothing frightening like he had imagined.`
`"............Whew. `
`...Hahahaha, it's only natural.`
` ...There's no way there could have been anything inside."`
`By now, Gohda had realized that he had been a coward.`
`......So while he still had some doubts about what had caused the lid to make that sound, `
`...he thought it wasn't a big problem, and decided not to worry about it too much.`
` Then he took the lid he had grabbed, ......and softly set it back down where it had been.`
`......It's alright, there won't be a sound.`
` ......Obviously.`
` As if witches or magic could exist...!`
`*clank*.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`"............Huh...?"`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*.`
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*!`
`"Hii, ......HIIIIIIIIIII!!"`
`All of the pots and utensils in the kitchen started clanking at once.`
` It grew even stronger, so that finally, the lid to one of the pots fell off...! `
`And, ......from inside that pot, .........a slender white arm reached out.`
` The lids fell off other pots one after another, `
`and another, `
`and another...`
`"Hiiiiiiiii!!!`
` As if, as if witches could exiiiist!!`
` As if I would believe iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air.`
`"What a letdown!`
` It's a real letdown that a person who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!"`
`"If you don't need him, I'll take him, he's all mine!!"`
`"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!! `
`I'll take him!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Wha, whaa?!?!`
` HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!""""`
`Come on, let's search, there's only one more.`
` That old hag! `
`Where is she? `
`She isn't in the mansion, what about the guesthouse? `
`Kuhihihihi, first one wins, first one wins, right?! `
`Come on, search search, find her find her...! `
`Don't be noticed by the relatives in the dining hall, right? `
`And don't get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse, right? `
`Search in silence, kill in silence! `
`After all, it's still just the first twilight! `
`She isn't in the guesthouse.`
` But she isn't in the mansion either? `
`Hey hey, I found her, I found her, she's in the rose garden.`
` Why's she standing around there without an umbrella? `
`I'm ready, all mine all mine all mi-ne!`
` You blockheads can just sit there and watch! `
`I told you, nooooooo, this one's miiiiiiiiiiiiine!! `
`Come on, if we take any longer we'll be scolded by Beatrice-sama!`
` Let's take care of it all at once!`
`"........................"`
`Come on, found her, surrounded her!`
` Come on, let's get along and do it all at once, okay?!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!!`
`".........Eeeh...?`
` .........Huh?"`
`"Wh, `
`......what is, `
`...this..."`
`"............Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho.`
` What naughty girls. `
`...Could you be friends of that child...?"`
`"...What is this, .........you old hag...!"`
`"There's got to be some mistake!! `
`One more time!!"`
`"......Why can she defend against us?!"`
`"Move aside!`
` One more time!!!"`
`"............No matter how often you try, it's useless. `
`This person, ...is good."`
`"............I am waiting for that child.`
` Would you mind calling for her?"`
`"D, do you think we'd be apprenticed to you like that?!"`
`"There's no need."`
`"Beatrice-sama...!"`
`"............It's enough to make me manifest myself.`
` ...I was sure that you had awakened."`
`"Ronove.`
` It has been a long time.`
` ......Yes, it truly has been a long time."`
`"This person's talking to Ronove-sama without using 'sama'......!"`
`"...............And.`
` It has been a long time for you too.`
` ...Beatrice."`
`"Sh, she's not even using 'sama' for Beatrice-sama..."`
`"Good. `
`Do you know who this person is?`
` ......Beatrice was originally this person's name.`
` I only inherited that name from her.`
` ......This person is my teacher.`
` The Predecessor, Lady Beatrice."`
`"The Predecessor, `
`......Lady Beatrice......"`
`Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa...`
` Then, after she was wrapped in a golden sparkle, she burst and disappeared, and Kumasawa's form was no longer there.`
`...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, .........the one who had, in the past, explained to Beatrice the path of an Endless Witch,`
` the only person Beatrice had called Teacher in her entire life.`
` Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful,`
` and her figure in that elegant dress was unrecognizable as an old lady...`
` No, this looked like a completely different person than Kumasawa.`
`".........Well, well, Teacher.`
` I never even dreamed the day would come that we would meet each other again."`
`"Yes, me too.`
` ...Certainly, I never even dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed."`
`"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken.`
` ......If you remained sleeping as usual, the first twilight could be finished without much trouble. `
`...Or should I welcome you?`
` ............I was just a little bored."`
`"......Just as usual, it seems you are toying with sinless people in a vulgar game.`
` ......I believe I have taught you several times that the power of the Endless Witch must not be used to cause people trouble."`
`"Don't say that, Teacher.`
` Isn't boredom our natural enemy?`
` This is just a little spice to escape from that.`
`.........Chi.`
` The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to call my minions.`
` ...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Teacher, at the same time..."`
`"It was because I predicted that,`
` that I slept very close to you like this.`
` ......As I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again.`
`...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me."`
`"..................You're as cunning as always, Teacher...`
` *cackle*..."`
`"Ronove.`
` Have the furniture children step back.`
` Furniture only serves its master.`
` The master is responsible for all of her crimes."`
`".........Certainly.`
` Madam Beatrice."`
`"I have already surrendered that name to this child.`
` ......Come now, step back.`
` Furniture girls.`
` ......If you didn't listen the first time, I am saying it again.`
` However, I will not say it a third time, alright...?"`
`"......Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` If you get involved, you will be turned to dust..."`
`"B, ......back, everyone..."`
`Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated.`
` After that, there was the Beatrice whose bold expression didn't falter, `
`and the teacher Beatrice, who had given up that name, and wore a composed smile...`
`"Well then.`
` ......Teacher.`
` What tea shall I prepare for our long awaited reunion?"`
`"Let's see.`
` This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet.`
` Shall I accept your hospitality? `
`.........It seems there has been a mistake, `
`......so will you give back my name and the title of Endless Witch?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` So there's even a license renewal policy for the title of Endless Witch? `
`......As you say, Teacher.`
` See how splendid your disciple has become, `
`and see how far she has surpassed what you were long ago...!"`
`It looked like the air between the two Beatrices exploded in fireworks.`
` Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space.`
`...As they watched, the seven sisters shivered.`
`...Because if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now.`
`"So, come.`
` Beatrice. `
`...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in my life.`
` I will now correct that error with my own hands!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
`...Chichichi. `
`......That's wrong, Teacheer.`
` My only error,`
` was becoming your disciple to learn this level of power, riiiiiiiiiiiiight? `
`What is magic?`
` What is the Endless Witch?`
` ......Isn't this just the power to notice?`
` You act as though you're so great.`
` Your turn is long over, Teacheeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"`
`".........I, `
`......I, I don't have a clue what's going on anymore......!`
` What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...!"`
`"......Poor thing.`
` It seems my disciple is causing you trouble.`
` I apologize."`
`"Y, ...you..., who are you?`
` Why did Kumasawa baa-chan turn into a nee-chan like this?!`
` I mean, who are you?!`
` I don't get it?!`
` What kind of special effects are these?!`
` My head feels like it's gonna explode!!"`
`"I am the witch teacher of that child.`
` My old name was Beatrice.`
` When that child succeeded me, I gave her that name, so I do not have a name."`
`"You already said it, but your disciple's been a real pain to me!`
` Please, take responsibility and do something!`
` No, wait!! `
`I don't believe in stuff like this!! `
`As if witches and magic could exist!!`
` I won't accept this messed-up battle!`
` You bastard, what should I believe?!!"`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho...`
` Just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` I'd expect nothing less from you, Teacher.`
` It looks like you ridiculously don't feel like opening your eyes even at this level...! `
`If you don't want to wreck the whole island, it looks like that'll be impossible, riiiiiight?`
` Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!"`
`In response to Beatrice's summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden.`
` And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens.`
` They stretched up to 100 {c:86EF9C:merute} tall, and each one had over 360 ports.`
` They were War Towers of the gods' army corps, which hadn't allowed even groups of ancient heroes to invade their precincts.`
` As Beatrice elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two-headed towers, she looked down on her teacher, sneering with an absolute superiority.`
` With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small,`
` like a butterfly dancing through a large tree.`
`"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!!`
` Don't think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, alright?`
` The density of the twin towers' barrage wouldn't just make you a pinned bug collection, it'd make you a madly stabbed pincushion, right...?"`
`Over 720 ports opened on the towers, and godly soldiers readied their multi-shot ballistas.`
`"Is your turn over with this?"`
`"Heh, are those your last words?!! `
`Blast awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`The ballista shots that numbered a little over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death.`
` The boorish sound as the bowstrings were played was probably even deeper than the sound of a death god swinging its sickle.`
`"Come, arise, Fallen Tower.`
` Split the single language, and make known the sin."`
`The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down.`
` That massive falling tower and its rubble, `
`sucked in the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them approached the body of the witch who had summoned it.`
` That's right, no one could approach the mysteries of heaven.`
` That was the reality of the fallen tower.`
`"As I would expect from you, Teacher! `
`If you do something, you always do it big!! `
`Kuhhuhuhuhuhyahyahya!!"`
`"My turn isn't over.`
` Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy spear."`
`As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a terrible gold-colored explosion, `
`from inside those flames, a massive spear showed itself, so tall, like a tower, that you had to look up to see all of it.`
`...It was even too large for a giant's hand.`
` It was a divinely beautiful Spear of the Gods, so massive that it gave the illusion that the tower which had fallen had turned into a spear of the same size.`
` A spear of certain victory that no one could escape.`
`"Looks like your twin towers are useless. `
`How foolish that you blocked off your means of escape on both sides.`
` You can't defend against even a single spear!"`
`When she snapped her fingers in command,`
` the massive tower-like spear shot at Beatrice like a lightning bolt.`
` It aimed right for the middle of the center of the Golden Witch's heart with extreme precision,`
` as she danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly,`
` slicing straight through the air like a flash of lightning.`
`"Hah!!`
` So, you use Gungnir in a place like this!!`
` You really are incredible, Teacheeeeeer!! `
`Explode, useless towers!`
` Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
` Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!"`
`The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold.`
` They became several billion gold butterflies.`
` Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers.`
` Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky, `
`and they lined up in front of Beatrice, protecting their master and holding massive shields which towered like windmills.`
` They were as massive as a mountain range.`
` The witch hiding behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains.`
` Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole giants regiment, `
`they had protected King Whilhelm's castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain,`
` and when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through.`
`"Foolish.`
` The misery of a witch who has forgotten to respect things sacred.`
` Did you think that giants could defend against a Spear of the Gods?!"`
`"......Indeed.`
` No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a Spear of the Gods.`
` A wonderful Epaulette Mate by Madam."`
`"No way?!`
` Beatrice-sama!!"`
`"Of course I haven't forgotten, Teacher! `
`Come arise, disciples of Hephaestus.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy shield!!"`
`A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers.`
` It was a group of countless butterflies.`
`...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror.`
` That was the absolute defensive wall given to the chief god by the goddess.`
` The Aegis Shield.`
` When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield,`
` there was a terrible thunderous roar.`
` It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens.`
` The Divine Spear spun around and around, and was sent flying in the direction of the sinking sun.`
`"Impossible... `
` She defended against the Divine Spear...!!"`
`"No, that is not correct.`
` She avoided the holy spear.`
` It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must not fight each other. `
`Although in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it."`
`"..................Your skills have improved from engaging in these fights all the time."`
`"Or rather, it seems that you are still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Teacher. `
`It's my turn to strike back.`
` I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear."`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released their holy gold shields.`
` The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake.`
` When they did, another gold whirlwind arose,`
` and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground.`
` At once, each of the giants lifted one of their legs high, and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles.`
` As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers' heads.`
`...They scattered into a golden splash and began to fall before the giants.`
` Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them.`
` The broken pieces numbered exactly 30, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the original, `
`which made 210 for all 7 of them, and all of those burst at once, `
`and each of those split into 30 thorns, so that there were 6300.`
` They became a barrage of thunderclouds drawing a beautiful geometric pattern, `
`and then each of those changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at Beatrice the Predecessor.`
`"It's oveeeeer!! `
`Beatrice-samaaa!!"`
`"I would expect nothing less. `
`......From Madam."`
`Certainly, a bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts should have reduced the teacher's body to dust.`
` But there was no impact.`
` Beatrice knew immediately that she had been fooled.`
` At that time, from the direction that the sun had supposedly sunk, she felt the impossible rays of sunlight.`
` A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile.`
` It was the figure of the teacher, holding aloft the Spear of the Gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago.`
`...She bore a sparkle like the sun on her back, and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness.`
`...As Beatrice watched, `
`she was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead-end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
` By now, the Predecessor Beatrice had seized a position directly alongside the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`"Now we are done playing, Beatrice...!"`
`".........Have I, `
`...exposed my flaaaaank......?!"`
`Her bold expression hadn't faltered once before now, but now it twisted for the first time.`
` And faster than Beatrice could click her tongue, the Predecessor Beatrice released the holy spear.`
` As it jumped through the air, it changed its form once more.`
`"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers.`
` Bestow upon me the giant-smashing Iron Hammer of heaven!"`
`"Giant soldiers, protect me!!! `
`What are you doing, you blockheads!!!"`
`By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air.`
` It was the legendary hammer that had shaken the King of the Frost Giants.`
` So the Giant Soldiers couldn't escape from that fear.`
` So no matter how much their master ordered them, they couldn't block the path of that hammer.`
`"Back Rank Mate! `
`Sleep in peace."`
`"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit......!!!"`
`Before the whirlwind of this massive chunk of metal, Beatrice was nothing more than a mere speck.`
` The instant the whirlwind started to suck Beatrice in, Beatrice's form turned into a massive War Tower.`
` The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattered tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it.`
` Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way.`
` Even the giant-smashing Iron Hammer couldn't break through the final tower protecting the witch.`
` However, this War Tower truly was the witch's last trump card.`
` It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once.`
` But this tower was impregnable.`
` No weapon could break through it.`
` At that time, the moon disappeared.`
` As Beatrice hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky.`
` When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death.`
` The Predecessor Beatrice rode the horse with him.`
` His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow.`
` And the Spear of the Gods was in his hand once more...`
` In other words, it was a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens.`
`"......*cackle*...`
` You got meee..."`
`"Smothered Mate. `
`It was fun, Beatrice!"`
`"Uuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name, was resolved.`
` The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground.`
` The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, wrapping the area in a gold-colored storm.`
` Then, the sound of thunder.`
` And the sound of the falling rain and wind.`
` If you looked around, there was nothing in the rose garden.`
`...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other.`
`.........But only Beatrice was different.`
` She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder, to her left buttocks,`
` unable to even reach the ground with her feet, `
`...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain...`
`".........B, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"...............`
` As expected, `
`...a fearsome person."`
`"It is decided.`
` Beatrice."`
`"......Ku, `
`......hihihihi, `
`......ouch...h..."`
`Beatrice wore a bitter smile of false courage,`
` but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful.`
`"The title and power of the Endless Witch.`
` Will you now return that to me as well as the name Beatrice.`
` ...You are too immature to be called the Endless Witch."`
`"............Stop...`
` Forgive me, Teacher...`
` I was just fooling around, okay......?"`
`"I will take my name back from you.`
` You should return to your original form.`
` Perhaps you should relinquish this power which is beyond you, and live a life suitable for yourself.`
`.........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`The Predecessor Beatrice began to recite the words of power.`
` When she did, small gold butterflies gathered around the skewered Beatrice, and began to swarm about her.`
` Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers...`
`...They began to suck the magical power out of Beatrice.`
` And it seemed that it caused her intense pain.`
` A cry of pain issued from Beatrice's mouth.`
` She no longer had any power to resist it...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` Try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
`.........Come, Beatrice?`
` Repeat it with me.`
` Let us sing a song together.`
` Then it will be over soon.`
` Let us end your pain as fast as possible."`
`"...Kuhihihi, `
`......ha, `
`...haha...`
`......You're right...`
` How long has it been, `
`.........since I have sung a song with you, Teacher......?"`
`"Come, together.`
` .........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have...?"`
`When the two of them began to recite the same song, `
`more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around Beatrice...`
`".........It's alright, Milady.`
` You will lose the fact that you are my disciple, `
`but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve.`
`...After that, I shall read a book for you again.`
` I shall bake you apple pies again.`
` Just like it was long ago.`
` ......Come, try to remember."`
`"......Hahahahahaha...`
` Yes, try to remember.`
` ...Are you finally starting to remember...?`
` .........Hey, Teacher.`
` Did you remember, `
`......that thing behind yooou...?"`
`"...What is this...? `
`..............................This is..."`
`When the Predecessor Beatrice looked behind her, `
`............there was a creepy hedgehog crouching there.`
` That's not it. `
`...It was, `
`......herself.`
` There was another Predecessor Beatrice, whose whole body was packed with ballista shots,`
` ......lying there like a pincushion doll...`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ......Is that wrong?`
`......Come, try to remember.`
` How were you killed? `
`......Kuhihihii, kuhyahhyahhyahhaaaaaaahh!!"`
`The Predecessor Beatrice was shocked.`
`...Instantly, her form began to grow faint...`
`"This......, `
`......when...did you............"`
`"In the beginning, I did not summon Shoulder Towers.`
` It was four towers.`
` Teacher, you nonchalantly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers, `
`which were lurking in the distance on either side of you.`
`......It was bad manners for me to say check so late.`
` Let me openly apologize.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The battle had been decided at the very beginning.`
` It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack Beatrice, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers.`
`...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides,`
` pinning and killing her.`
` However, Beatrice hadn't wanted it to be resolved with that.`
` She had wanted to make her teacher take her next move, and had continued acting as though the game was still on.`
` She had immediately revived her with the Endless power, `
`...and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened...`
` Then the Predecessor had slowly remembered that she had already been killed, `
`......and had begun to completely erase her form.`
` When she did, the spear which had pierced Beatrice also erased itself.`
` Beatrice finally fell and landed on her feet.`
`...There wasn't even a trace of a scar.`
`".........It was fun, `
`Teacher.`
` If you want to play again, I'll revive you any time.`
` Because once we've had some fun, I'll make you remember that you were a corpse again.`
` Okay?`
` I fully obeyed your instructions, right...?`
` Didn't you say to always put a toy back in its box when you are done playing with it? `
`*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"......Was it, an easy victory?"`
`"You fool, it was a difficult victory!! `
`............If I hadn't tricked her with the four towers, I would have been the one to die!`
` ......As I would expect from Teacher.`
` .........But this is heartrending.`
`...Now, I have completely surpassed Teacher.`
` Ronove.`
` Make Teacher's remains a little better.`
` ......I haven't lost my respect for her that much."`
`"Certainly.`
` Tonight's first twilight became a little too riotous.`
` It will require some cleaning up.`
` It shall be handled immediately.`
` Goats, it is time to clean up."`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness, `
`becoming goat-headed attendants, which appeared one after another.`
` One by one, they wordlessly stood at attention in a line behind Ronove's back.`
`"This time, what shall be done about the six corpses?`
` Another closed room pattern?"`
`"......I am not in a mood to think now.`
` I will leave it to you Ronove.`
` ...An extraordinary closed room to torment Battler, if you would."`
`"Certainly.`
` It shall be extraordinary."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahhhahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`A-lright, where is Battler?`
` Battleeeeer, did you watch my big momeeeeeeeeent??"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?! `
`Witches existing and everything!`
` After being shown that tremendous fantasy, `
`what can I deny now?!!`
` I don't get it anymore!`
` It was like that last time too, but how can I deny that awesome, wonderful magical battle?!"`
`"I~sn't that ri~ght?!`
` After watching this, you can't talk your way out of it, riiiiiiiight???`
` Alright, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, kuhhihhyahhyahhya!`
` Uhhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!"`
`"Milady, your laugh is undignified."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` But that isn't my fault. `
`After all, if Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth and shows me that ever so bitter expression,`
` it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee... `
`Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!"`
`"So, Battler-sama.`
` Why don't you return to the table without losing heart?`
` Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?"`
`"Quit messing with me!!`
` How the hell can I make a counterargument?! `
`In the first place, since about the time that the tower sprouted up out of the earth, everything was already screwed up!!`
` Should I say that, actually, underground on Rokkenjima, there's a secret laboratory for super-alloy combining robots or something,`
` and that by pushing a button, a strange tower sprouts up?!`
` Right, and then those huge giants must be the robots,`
` or maybe an evil secret association's mecha-monsters?! `
`I don't get it!! `
`Don't talk to meeeeeeeeeee, uuoooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"`
`"Look look look look, don't cry, alright??`
` Bang bang, it's magic!!`
` If you want, I'll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain! `
`I can even bury the whole island in those massive-breasted nee-chans you like so much, seeeeeeeeee??`
` Hihhihhihhihhi!! `
`Come come, look look look, my turn is over, seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Show me your response, counterattack!!`
` You can't, can yoooooouuu?`
` Accept that there's a quadrillion things you can't do!!`
` You're useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight?`
` You actually like this kind of fantasy, don't yooooouuu?? `
`I get it, that's been going around on the streets lately hasn't it?!`
` In manga and light novels, in anime and movies!`
` Some teenage brat gets a whole bunch of some strange special ability, and they go all out with the fate of the world at risk! `
`You love that too, don't you?!`
` I know, don't hide it, you love it, right, hi-hyahhyahhyah!!`
` Hasn't that thing that you love just displayed itself before your eyes? `
`Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won't believe in meeeeeeeeee??`
` Believe, believe, believe it!`
` You can't argue back, not after you've been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight? `
`Look look look look, answer,`
` you don't need to think, you can just obediently say 'sorry, Beatrice-sama'!`
` Look look, try saying it, 'sorry, Beatrice-sama', try saying it, say it say it, don't be embarrassed, `
`kukikikikakkakakahhyahhyaaaah hahhahhahahhhahahhyaaahh!!"`
