`A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating.`
` A so-called hygienic...emotionless white was the theme of that room.`
`...It was a hospital room of a certain university hospital.`
` Neither her doctors nor the person herself had any doubts that this room, `
`which an ordinary person wouldn't be able to afford just to spend the night, would be the last room she stayed in...`
` Was the person on the bed, `
`............Eva? `
`Even if someone told you that was so, she was unbelievably aged and worn out.`
` The well-built man in a suit waiting in the corner near the door was having a conversation with the outside on the intercom in a small voice.`
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person.`
` After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed.`
`...Eva had been awake for a short while.`
`......However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.`
`"......Ange ({p:0:縁寿})-san has arrived in the lobby below.`
` Should we let her pass?"`
`"........................"`
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer.`
` However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange.`
`...Eva had been the one to call her.`
` And she was right on time.`
` For Eva now, anyone who wanted a meeting without an appointment would be refused.`
` The room was dark, even though it was still light outside, because the curtains were closed.`
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.`
` They were all there to protect Eva's person...`
` Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.`
` Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems.`
` The door was unlocked, then opened, `
`.........and a high school-aged girl was standing there.`
`"Chairman.`
` Ange-san has arrived."`
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.`
` However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup.`
`......After being shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to small changes in smell.`
`"........................`
` So you came. `
`......Ange."`
`"......I came.`
` You did call me."`
`On Eva's face, you could not find the expression of one warmly welcoming their niece.`
`...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to meet with their aunt.`
` Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.`
` The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.`
`"......It's not only stuffy, but dark too.`
` Can I open the curtains...?"`
`"............Did you plan for that hit man you hired to shoot through the window......?"`
`".........I wish I could get hired to assassinate you.`
` All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."`
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha......"`
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.`
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking.`
`......At the very least, Eva believed that someone was after her life.`
` All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...It was said that this fortune also included the 10 tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have hidden.`
` It couldn't be helped that this vast wealth would fall into the cunning, sly, and extremely jealous Eva's hands,`
` ......but it was rumored that if it passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away at once.`
` By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants.`
`......If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.`
`...And if Ange were to be killed as well, `
`......that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie.`
` In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,`
` ...was in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for her life to be targeted by some unknown person.`
`......And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.`
` It was because she knew that, after losing her only precious son George, `
`......the inheritor of her own wealth would be none other than the girl who had been absent at that family conference 12 years ago,`
` and who had survived.`
` Eva shunned Ange, disliked her, and even hated her.`
` She isolated Ange in a special school and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to keep her as a pet until death.`
`......However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,`
` and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference 12 years ago.`
` Both Eva and Ange, ...hated each other.`
` Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...`
`".........And?`
` Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"`
`"......I don't have much time left.`
` ......These quack doctors still can't detect any of the poison that's filling me up.`
` .........I know.`
` I'm sure it's a secret assassination drug used by those Soviet KGBs.`
` ...Ooh, I'll be killed, I'll be killed...!!`
` Isn't that great! Very soon, I will die, and then you will be so relieved...!"`
`"........................`
`...What a pitiable person."`
`This always happened.`
`......They immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.`
` Eva, who was full of jealousy, believed that someone was always after her life.`
` In actuality, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,`
` she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, and had repeatedly made money by any means necessary, creating many enemies along the way.`
` With a massive supply of capital, she had plotted to aggressively buy businesses which were starting to have rapid growth, `
`making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.`
`......Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with 12 years ago...`
` She had repeated this constantly for 12 years.`
`......She had also earned a lot of hatred.`
` If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that this was because of the loneliness from losing her family.`
`......However, of all the people who knew her now, none would defend her.`
` For some time, Eva eloquently spoke of how her life was being targeted,`
` listing off names of people who held hatred for her,`
` and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed.`
` Even though Ange heard her own name included in that list,`
` her expression did not change significantly, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...`
`".........You know what? `
`............I really hate `
`you."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Same here."`
`".........I built this future for George's sake.`
` ......To think that it would be snatched away by you.`
` ...To think that it would be stolen by Rudolf's daughter...`
`.........I can't bear it. `
`......To think that, without leaving a child, `
`...even my fortune will be stolen, `
`.........that, `
`......I cannot forgive............!"`
`"......In that case, why don't you give all of your fortune to charity?`
` What about those religious people you've requested so many times?"`
`"............*cackle*cackle*!`
` They all say the same thing.`
` ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.`
` They always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.`
` ......Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Then I thought of something.`
` I stopped donating!"`
`For a time, Eva had searched for the founders of several strange and new religious cults, perhaps looking for peace in her heart.`
`...But in the end, they did not give her heart any relief, `
`and only further increased her jealousy...`
`".........If you have too much money, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"`
`"I've thought of something even more interesting.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've worried over it a lot.`
` What could I do to make things horrible for you?`
`......I thought about killing you.`
` I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and selling you off to a slave trader or something.`
` Wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` You would have your arms and legs chopped off and be made to entertain the guests until you died.`
` Aaah, that would be so wonderful, `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............Are you having fun?"`
`"Yes, I am.`
` It's fun to scare you...`
`......But very soon, I will die.`
` ...So I thought about how I can continue to cause you pain even after I die.`
` .........And then, ......*cackle*cackle*!!`
` It was surprisingly simple.`
` ......I called you because I wanted to talk about it."`
`"..................I have midterms coming up.`
` Keep it brief."`
`"...I have decided. `
`I will have you inherit all of my fortune."`
`"........................`
`...Huh."`
`"Not only that, `
`......I decided that until the very day that I die, `
`...I'll increase that fortune as much as I can, inflate it to massive proportions and have you inherit all of it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, can you even imagine what that would be like...?"`
`"......I don't get it.`
` Because it's stupid."`
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That's right, you don't get it, do you...?!`
` Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!`
` Every day, monsters from across Japan come to play.`
` From now on, your entire life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.`
` The media will criticize me no matter what I do or don't do!`
` If I donate, they'll attack me as a bourgeois, and if I hesitate, I'll be abused as a miser.`
` Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?`
` I realized that I would love to invite you to that kind of life, when you are so young and have so much ahead of you.`
` Isn't it truly wonderful?"`
`".........Looks like the public is right in its criticism of all that you've done."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Too true, yes, that is too true.`
` ...Go ahead, abuse me as much as you want.`
` And then you will be burdened with that criticism.`
` ......Japanese culture says that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should die.`
` No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be raised as a symbol of envy and hate from across Japan.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`I wonder how twisted your life will become after living this way...?`
` You have no allies!`
` No one will listen to your worries.`
` Abusing you will become a public sport.`
` And no one can stop that! `
`Oh, Ange!`
` Ehheheheheheh, `
`oh, I'm really looking forward to it.`
` ...I wonder how you will live your life, and how you'll end it...!`
` Fully enjoy a life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, being unable to love anyone, being unable to talk with anyone...!!`
` I'll be patiently waiting for you to take that story of hardship with you as you fall into hell.`
` Heheheheh, `
`ahahhahahahahahahaha, `
`wa-hhahhahhahhahhahhahhahha, `
`gkk, `
`*cough*cough*, `
`ghah!!"`
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.`
` Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned, `
`......Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.`
` Perhaps because he found the violent coughing odd, as he gave a short knock on the door, the guard flew in.`
` Ange glanced at him, wordlessly showing that she wouldn't move a step from where she was.`
`......Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death.`
` However, that was fortunately a needless anxiety.`
` As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.`
` As he did, Eva kept coughing, looking like she was in pain.`
` Ange thought that this would be the final form of Rokkenjima's witch that she would be able to see.`
` Eventually, the coughing subsided and Eva regained her normal breathing.`
`...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Now, I will give to you`
` the cursed mass of gold and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya head, `
`......as well as, `
`............the name of the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` ............Enjoy your insane, twisted life fitting for the name of the witch...!"`
`"I don't need that.`
` More importantly, tell me.`
` ......On that day, what happened on Rokkenjima?`
` .........I don't believe that there was an accident.`
` Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Father and Mother and Nii-san died......!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Oh, that must be the best way to harass you, right?`
` ......What happened on that day?`
` What happened on this day in 1986...?`
` ......You want to know what they said before they died, riiight...? `
`I won't tell yoooooouu, `
`aaahhhyahhyahhyahhyah!!`
` I'll leave behind the cursed gold!`
` But you know what? I'll take the truth you desire with me to hell...!`
` That's the best way I can harass you!! `
`Is that too harsh?`
` If you want to hear, try going to hell and asking your family there!`
` In that case, you better die right now, right?! `
`Ahhahahahahaha, why don't you just give up and die right now?! `
`Waaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again.`
` And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions......`
` October 4, 1986.`
` On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary and final family conference was held.`
` And on the next day, October 5...`
`'An extremely unfortunate accident' occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.`
`'Fortunately', Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that, `
`and succeeded almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune.`
` However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards, `
`and her unnatural actions at 'the time of the unfortunate accident', the public was in an uproar over whether this might have been a conspiracy to get all of the inheritance for herself.`
` Under pressure from the public, prosecutors repeatedly tried investigating, `
`and the media began tracing the outline of a conspiracy they called the Rokkenjima Suspicion,`
` but in the end, they weren't even able to find enough proof that this 'unfortunate accident' was a crime.`
` However, because the media continued to give the impression that the Rokkenjima Suspicion was Eva's conspiracy,`
` public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.`
`...Of course, that was also influenced by the bad impression caused by all that easily-condemnable overbearing financial activity,`
` which she had carried out using that vast wealth.`
` Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the media would bring back the Rokkenjima Suspicion, `
`blaming the justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason that she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.`
` So the impression that she was a great villain grew stronger and stronger...`
` Her heart eventually degenerated, `
`...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...`
` By now, Eva had no one she trusted, and no family.`
`......After her beloved husband had passed away, the talk shows occasionally mentioned his company, `
`saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.`
` Even her beloved son, George, `
`was dramatized as the stereotypical 'rich, lazy son' that the public expected,`
` ...and no one even wanted to know what a simple and honest character he had possessed.`
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one was interested.`
` The public was only interested out of curiosity,`
` about how a super-rich evil woman who killed her whole family lived her pitiful later years.`
` So that happened more and more, `
`...and eventually...`
`...Eva's personality was transfigured until she was called a lunatic......`
` It was said that she sometimes remembered that this was exactly the same way her father, who she had once admired, had been in his later years,`
` and laughed at herself with scorn...`
` And, on the day of that final family conference...`
` Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated.`
` At the age of 6, she had lost her family and had gained Eva as her guardian.`
` Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative,`
` Eva 'took very good care of her'.`
` She had imposing guards always surrounding Ange's person, to prevent her from coming to harm.`
`...Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen.`
`'So that she can live a full and pleasant school life',`
` Eva had sent Ange to an elegant boarding school which took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.`
` She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.`
` She was never given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends or stuffing her mouth with crepes,`
` ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.`
` Ange did not have a single friend.`
` If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.`
`......All of them were strictly ordered not to let shabby humans approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.`
` During that time, the talk shows were always talking about Ushiromiya Eva, and always spreading rumors about her many financial evil deeds.`
`......Those who knew about her 'daughter' naturally began to keep their distance.`
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and any time something bad happened,`
` even though there was no proof, it was whispered as truth that the school had done something out of concern for her feelings.`
` The environment makes the person.`
` By now, she had a heart as wild as those around her feared.`
`...No one trusted her, so she didn't even try to believe them.`
` No one loved her, so she didn't even try to love.`
` And on top of all of this, when Eva had caught an incurable illness,`
` it was whispered that this too was a conspiracy, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...`
` Everyone whispered that the witch girl was a witch.`
` Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.`
`...So Ange also, `
`definitely, `
`no, `
`as though it might as well be true, accepted it.`
` Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch, `
`when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she only felt like saying 'you just figured that out now?'`
`However, she was at least sure of one thing.`
` This title of witch that she had inherited would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.`
` She would be the last head of the Ushiromiya family, and the last isolated, Golden Witch......`
` Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.`
` Compared to the winds of the world which had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.`
` Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.`
` It was supposed to be clear out that night.`
`...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.`
`...However, the light from the ground was too bright, so you couldn't see them at all.`
`...Ange couldn't really imagine that the thing she really sought could be in that unseen starlight.`
` The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.`
`...She could imagine that this place was the closest to the world she really should be in.`
`............There was only one thing that Ange cursed.`
` Why had she not been able to go to that family conference, on that day 12 years ago? `
`Even though, if she had gone, she would probably have been able to be with her family forever.`
`...She repeated this thought over and over, ...and dreamed about her family.`
` Myself as I was 12 years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.`
` But both Dad and Mom are too far away, and my hand won't reach them.`
` Battler nii-san has always really loved me, and his hand always pats my head, `
`.........but even though it looks like that hand will reach me, even it does not reach.`
` For some reason, I started having that dream over and over again.`
`......Every time I saw the same dream, `
`I tried to stretch out my hand even more forcefully, but my useless effort continued to repeat inside my dreams.`
` Even if it had been only Battler nii-san, who lived...`
`.........Then perhaps, at least we would be able to live by supporting each other in my cold and lonely reality.`
` But his hand never reached me.`
` So even if I climb to the roof of this tall building, `
`......I am distantly separated from all of them.`
`......A mysterious girl appeared in my dreams and urged me.`
` That girl in my dreams urged me to arrive at the truth of what had happened 12 years ago.`
`"........................`
`......Everything that happened to Father and the rest of them on that day, `
`...if only I could learn what that was, `
`............would they come back?`
` At least one of them...!"`
`There was no way, `
`...that someone who could answer those words existed.`
` I understand.`
`.........In this world, I have no family or friends.`
` Therefore, `
`.........let's go.`
` ...Let's go home.`
`......To where my family is.`
` From the beginning, ...Ange's figure had been on the far side of the fence.`
` The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it actually did not give rise to fear.`
` Because if she faced down, she would surely be taken to the world below.`
`......I faced upwards.`
` Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family is.`
`.........Who cares about vast wealth.`
` Who cares about cursed gold.`
` Who cares about the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
` What I really want...cannot be obtained even with a mountain of gold...`
` What I need for that...is to take a single step forward...just that much courage.`
`............At that time,`
` ...I definitely heard a voice.`
` I knew that voice.`
` The voice that had always, ......called to me in my dreams...`
` Before my eyes, ......in other words, in mid-air above that jet black nighttime scenery...`
`......There was the figure of that girl I had seen in my dreams...`
` She spoke again, with the same voice I had heard inside my dreams.`
`".........Your assistance is needed."`
`"...My, `
`............assistance......?`
` Who needs it......?"`
`".........Your family needs it.`
` ...Your family is being imprisoned for all eternity from this day 12 years ago until the next day."`
`"I, ...if I save them, `
`......does that mean my family will come back?!"`
`When I asked the question I had most wanted to, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.`
`"......I cannot promise that.`
` The enemy is the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
` ...A mighty opponent.`
` I cannot oppose her.`
` ......But, another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."`
`".........I, I don't know...what you're talking about."`
`"......The only one who can oppose the Beatrice of 1986...`
` is the final Beatrice of 1998.`
` .........In other words, you.`
` Ange.`
` ............{c:86EF9C:ANGE} Beatrice."`
`"That witch from 12 years ago, `
`......took away my family.........?"`
`"That's right.`
` She is your foe.`
` ............The source that always leads to your future of isolation."`
`"........................`
`......My, `
`......family's, `
`.........foe."`
`"......In exchange, I will search for the Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, the world where your family comes home.`
` .........I won't promise you that your desire will be granted.`
` ...Beatrice's game board in 1986 is quite perfect.`
`......I had planned on bringing you that ideal Fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it.`
` ............It's a very firm fate.`
` I haven't seen the likes of it since I fought with Lambdadelta."`
`"..........................................`
` I, `
`......I don't know, `
`...what you're talking about."`
`".........I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` In exchange, if it is possible for you to receive it, I promise to search for the happiest resolution for you."`
`"........................Revenge......"`
`"......It may be a fruitless effort.`
` Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return.`
` Even with a miraculous probability, you may be able to bring only one person back."`
`...Ange understood the meaning of that dream.`
`......That dream where it seemed that, with just a little bit more, her hand might at least be able to reach Battler nii-san.`
`"A miraculous probability, ......is still higher than zero, right...?`
` Is it 1%...?"`
`"......Trying to read any probabilities before the result is useless.`
` So I cannot tell you that number."`
`"But unlike if I don't do anything, there definitely is a small possibility."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as you do not throw your desire away.`
` But prepare yourself.`
` It is extremely close to zero."`
`"..................`
` Alright. `
`I'll take you up on that offer."`
`"......Are you sure?`
` You probably won't be able to come back here again."`
`"This is not a world that I'm supposed to be in.`
` ......And, I'll find the world that I am supposed to be in myself.`
` Tell me your name."`
`"The Witch of Miracles, Bernkastel.`
` And by that name, `
`I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, ANGE Beatrice.`
` ......As of now, you are a true witch."`
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...`
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.`
` At that time, I heard a *clunk*.`
`...It was the sound of the door that went from the staircase to the roof.`
` There were Eva oba-san's guards.`
`...'Guards' was only a name. Aren't they the cage that's closest to me, shutting me in? `
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.`
`"20, target found.`
` Requesting assistance on the roof."`
`"Ange-san...!`
` We were looking for you!`
` It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"`
`".........Wha-t's that?"`
`"......That's my fan club.`
` ...I'm pretty popular."`
`"No point in getting caught.`
` .........Let's go."`
`Looking annoyed, Bernkastel turned on her heels.`
` ...In the jet black sky.`
` Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.`
`"Ange-san!!!`
` Wait!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"`
`"Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless.`
` Well, <see you again> next time. `
`Please send a limo to get me.`
` 'Cause everyone else will be there too.`
` See you."`
