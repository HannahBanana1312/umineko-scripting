`...30 minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse.`
` By any measure, their return was too late.`
`...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who were waiting by the entrance, were reaching the limits of their patience.`
` The chain was set on the door.`
` That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked, and the master key stolen from them.`
` For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...`
`"......They really are too late.`
` You don't think something happened to them...?"`
`"............Hmm..."`
`Krauss glanced between his watch and the door, struggling to keep his composure.`
`"If, ...something happened to prevent them from returning......"`
`"...A terrible thought, but it looks as though we should ready ourselves for that possibility.`
` ......It really was reckless, after all."`
`"Th, that is what I said...!`
` Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...!`
` How foolish!`
` Why go outside, even though Rosa-san had just been attacked...?!!"`
`".........Nothing will come from saying that now.`
` ...Anyways, this way, there are three adults in the guesthouse.`
` Me, you, `
`......and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever."`
`At that time, there was the forceful sound from the hallway of a door being opened, and they heard Eva's panicked voice.`
`...That voice kept calling Hideyoshi's name.`
`......It seemed as though, while down with a high fever, she had had a bad dream or something and was calling her husband's name.`
`"Eva-san..., `
`what is it, are you alright...?"`
`"Wh, ...where is my husband?!`
` My husband isn't here!!`
` Even though he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time!`
` Even though he promised that he'd grasp my hand the whole time!!"`
`...Krauss was struck dumb by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.`
`"......C, calm down...`
` Hideyoshi-san is with Rudolf-san and Kyrie-san, and they're outside right now."`
`"Outside?!?!`
` Wh, wh, why, `
`why did he go outside, `
`after he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time?! `
`You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"...Eva, calm yourself.`
` ......Hideyoshi-san returned to the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie-san."`
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!`
` Why did he go outside, even though it's safe here?!!`
` Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"`
`"............`
`......They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.`
` ...Hideyoshi-san was worried about your health, and he told us so..."`
`"When will they come back?!`
` When will they come back?!`
` Don't go outside, don't go to the rose garden, don't go to the mansion!!`
` The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking around!`
` If she finds you, you'll be killed, you'll definitely be killed!!`
` When will my husband come back?!"`
`".........They left here thirty minutes ago.`
` We are waiting for their return."`
`"Th, thirty minutes?!`
` Isn't that strange? Why would it take so much time for them to go to the mansion to get food and come back?!`
` And why are you two just standing around here?!`
` We have to get them!!`
` We have to quickly go to where they are!!`
` Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"`
`Eva probably had quite a nightmare.`
`...And because it had continued even after she had woken up, she could no longer hide her confusion.`
` Natsuhi tried calming her down, but all it did was make Eva's emotions explode even more.`
`...Maybe it was because they heard that disturbance.`
` Battler and the kids, who should have gone up to the second floor, were peeking their faces through the slightly open lobby door.`
` Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.`
` And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.`
`...Everyone in the guesthouse was gathered by the entrance, and understood the current situation.`
`"I agree with Mother.`
` We should go to check on Father and the rest."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` There's also the chance that their load is too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it.`
` They should welcome some extra hands."`
`"......R, Rosa-san was attacked not long ago.`
` ...There's a possibility that this is a second disaster.`
` We should act with caution here and..."`
`"Don't be a fool!!`
` What do you mean, caution?!`
` Are you saying we should watch my husband die, even though he might be begging for help?!`
` I'm going to look, and the cowards can stay here!!"`
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.`
` Judging by her features, it would be useless for anyone to try and stop her.`
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head.`
`"I'll go too.`
` You will too, right, Battler-kun?`
` The more people, the better...!"`
`"S, sure!!`
` Eva oba-san, we're coming even if you tell us not to."`
`"...I, I'm coming too...!`
` I can't be the only one to hide in a safe place...!"`
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!!`
` Stay here with me.`
` Alright?!"`
`It was like they were implying that those three had already been killed anyways, so it was pointless to go outside.`
` Natsuhi also realized that Eva felt like her heart had been gouged out, but she said that strongly as Jessica's mother.`
`"..................You're right.`
` That should be fine.`
` Let's have Nii-san's family keep an eye on the guesthouse. `
`This is my family's and Battler-kun's family's problem.`
` And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would come too.`
` Just in case."`
`".........In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo `
`found the corpses of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."`
`".........The fourth twilight through the sixth twilight?`
` Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"`
`"Yes. `
`......The demon stakes were buried into them, one in Rudolf's forehead,`
` one in Hideyoshi's chest,`
` and one in Kyrie's stomach.`
` The clothing on all three was disordered, and because of this, it is thought that they had been fighting or running away.`
` Since the three corpses were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."`
`".........With stakes, in the forehead, chest, and stomach.`
` ......Horrible, just like usual..."`
`"........................"`
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he thought that maybe he should tell Battler.`
`...In actuality, the witch had killed them in a much more horrible way.`
`......Beato had advised the witch to restrain herself, which was why the corpses had been left in this manner.`
` The new witch, thinking that it would fit as long as she gouged with a stake,`
` ......would probably have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a human.`
` Rosa's and Maria's corpses were probably especially striking.`
`...If they had been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the exposed corpse have been? `
`Beato had changed that into the 'still better' kind of killing Battler had spoken of.`
` And wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about that.`
`...But in Battler's eyes, that might do more harm than good.`
` To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.`
` While saying that she had changed it to a better way of dying, and that he wanted Battler to understand Beato's feelings, might have made it possible for a demon to pardon her, `
`......there was no way it would work the same way for a human.`
` Understanding this, Ronove remained silent even though he knew of Beato's modest effort...`
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead.`
` ......Ronove, please, declare it in red."`
`"........................"`
`"Hey, can't you hear me?`
` ...Please, declare it in red.`
` Repeat it.`
` 'Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead'."`
`"............My apologies.`
` Allow me to decline from repeating that."`
`"What's that...?`
` That's so sudden...what are you planning...?"`
`By now, proclaiming that the victims were dead in red was almost a given in this battle.`
` Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.`
`...So when Ronove refused as part of his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.`
`"My apologies.`
` Someone speaking in Milady's place such as myself must relinquish his turn at this point.`
` ...Accordingly, 'I' cannot repeat that in red.`
` ......The only one qualified to repeat that, ...is Milady."`
`"..............."`
`"...It is a correct point.`
` Ronove is but an agent for Beato's side.`
` ......If Ronove steps down from the position of agent, and Battler-kun will not accept Beato as an opponent,`
` ...a new agent must be created."`
`"......There is no new agent.`
` ......Please, Battler-sama.`
` Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."`
`"............Sorry, `
`but that's advice I can't listen to.`
` ......I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, cruel bastard as my opponent.`
` ...I won't give up in this game because I don't accept her."`
`"Regarding your point about her being unpleasant, I apologize in Milady's stead.`
` Allow me to pledge that Milady will not take unpleasant actions again."`
`"...................`
`......I wonder about that."`
`"...Battler-kun.`
` I also apologize as that child's teacher.`
` She has listened well, so would you please forgive her just this once?"`
`"......Hey, hey, quit it please.`
` You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy. `
`...And no matter how much you guys apologize, it won't reach my ears.`
` ......If Beato can say that from her own mouth, `
`............well, it's not like I won't listen to her."`
`"............Understood.`
` If that is your only condition for accepting that child again, let us have that child apologize. `
`.........Ronove.`
` Call for that child.`
` Is that alright, Battler-kun...?"`
`"............Sheesh.`
` ...Do whatever you want.`
` Still, don't expect that I'll forgive her.`
` ......Call for that irritating witch."`
`"...You have my thanks, Battler-sama.`
` ......I will now call her. `
`......Milady, Battler-sama is calling for you."`
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form.`
`...It was much more docile than the way she had appeared before now.`
`"............Did you call, Ronove?"`
`"...I believe you heard.`
` ......Is there something you have to say, from your own mouth...?"`
`"........................"`
`"....................."`
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze.`
` Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well,`
` ......and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with frozen hands...`
` Even as she did that, the game board was proceeding...`
` In the hall, they had just found the corpses of the new victims, and had broken down crying...`
`"......Dad, `
`......Kyrie-san..., `
`...oooooooooooooooooohhhh..., `
`oooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh..."`
`"Dear, ...deeeaar..., whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"`
`"...Mother, `
`......get a hold of yourself......`
`......I'm also, `
`......crushed, `
`......and sad......!"`
`"...............They probably died instantly.`
` ...I'm sure that, even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, it would have been too late..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` They were definitely alive!!`
` His chest was stabbed with something like this...!`
` My husband must have died in extreme pain...!! `
`If we had come faster, ...surely they would have been saved!`
` They would surely have been saved!! `
`Uuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh..."`
`"......It must be tough..., for you too, Battler-kun, .........so stay strong......"`
`"............I'm alright, ...it's alright, Aniki...`
` Let me cry just a little bit longer...`
`......I've got it the best...`
` I should be the least sad...!`
` So if you let me cry just a little longer, ......I'll be fine..."`
`"That isn't true...`
`......I can understand how much it must hurt your heart to have lost both parents...`
`...I still have Mother.`
` ...That's much better than it is for you, Battler-kun..."`
`"No, that's wrong!!`
` It's got to be toughest for you, George-aniki...`
`......I understand, Aniki... `
`...In this group, ...you are the saddest, and the one who has it toughest!!`
` I understand that..., `
`so I can't keep on sobbing like this...!!`
` Oooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`"......Why, ......do you say it is toughest for me......?"`
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie-san, ......were people I would eventually split up with when I grew up and became independent.`
` Since they're parents, it is fated that they would die before their children.`
` ...It's just that it happened a little early...!`
`.........But it's different for you, Aniki.`
` You wouldn't have split up with your parents someday.`
` .........You should have lived your whole lives together,`
` .........and you've even lost Shannon-chan too, right...?!!"`
`"........................"`
`"It's not like human lives have different weights.`
` Whether it's a baby or an old person, they should all be respected the same...!`
` ......But still, the longer the life of a person afterwards,`
` ...the longer the future you've built together, ............the sadder the fact of death is......!!`
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon-chan, right?`
` You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, right?!`
` .........Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,`
` ......stuff like my pain doesn't even come close...!!`
`.........So you should be forgiven for crying much, much more, Aniki...!!`
` And yet, ...just because you act like a big brother for us cousins, `
`.........you forcibly act like you're composed......!"`
`"............Stop it, ...Battler-kun."`
`George was trying to make a calm smile.`
`......But already, .........he couldn't stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.`
`"......There's no way I wouldn't, `
`.........be sad, right...?`
` .........Together with Shannon, I painted a picture of many futures in my mind.`
` We talked of dreams that couldn't all come true even in a thousand lifetimes.`
` ......Of those dreams, `
`even the very first one, `
`............having her move into my family register, could not be granted, `
`.........so there's no way I wouldn't, `
`............be sad, right.........?"`
`"Compared to that, I, ......I...!!`
` Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!`
` When even you're holding back, Aniki, I have no right to shed any more tears!!"`
`"......We're the same.`
` ...We both feel the same sadness from losing those close to us.`
` .........so there's no rule that you can't shed any more tears than me, Battler-kun.`
`.........And,`
` ......for me too, ...there's no rule, ...that says I have to hold back my tears any longer."`
`"...Aniki, ......Anikii...!!!`
` Ooooooooooooooooooooohhhh!!"`
`"Shannon, with whom I talked of the future, died.`
` Father is dead too.`
` .........How sad, ......how sad...`
`......Oooooooooooohhhhhhh!!"`
`As Battler and George tightly hugged each other, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for those people important to them...`
`"............Do you understand why I'm saying that George-aniki has it the toughest...?"`
`"I, ......I was listening, so I understand.`
` ......The sadness is proportional to the length of time that would have been spent together in their lives after that..."`
`"......Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though.`
` .........We humans aren't like you witches.`
` ......From the time we're alive to the moment we die, we live in that limited period with our utmost strength.`
`.........I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that.`
` ......Furthermore, I definitely can't forgive anyone who sneers at people and toys with them.`
` ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that."`
`"........................"`
`"......It isn't just the time we would live afterwards.`
` ......Sneering at the lives of people living with all their strength...`
` That's what I can't forgive the most.`
` George-aniki lived his life by recklessly doing his best.`
` ...He must have shown up today heroically prepared to marry Shannon-chan.`
` ......It's completely different from me, since I was happy just to be able to meet my cousins after a long while."`
`"...B, .........but still..."`
`"Beato.`
` For now, stay silent and listen."`
`"............H, ...hmm."`
`".........In a way, I understand your excuse.`
` ...You say that you need to continue murdering according to the epitaph for your own resurrection.`
`......So judging by the circumstances of your position, `
`......I can just barely understand your murders.`
` ......Because to you, that is a necessary action.`
` ......In that case, all further unnecessary actions are because of your meaningless brutal hobby.`
`......In other words, if killing the six people for the first twilight was a 'necessary action' for you, `
`...then all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets was completely unnecessary,`
` and just your brutal hobby.`
` .........I definitely cannot forgive this aspect of you."`
`"............H, ...mm......"`
`"When you repeatedly killed Rosa oba-san in that horrible way,`
` ......I heard that you were saying something like `
`'in the very end, I will bring them back to life, so it doesn't matter how I kill them, right?'`
` I heard from Virgilia."`
`".........Well, that, `
`......well, `
`...umm........."`
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end,`
` is a completely unnecessary action of toying with a life, isn't it?`
`.........If you're going to kill, do it instantly!`
` Don't toy with them!!`
` If you won't kill them, then don't tease them!!`
` You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life.`
` So I can't accept you...!`
` I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the weight of a life, and the sadness when that life is lost!"`
`"............That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.`
` ...The Endless Witch has no concept of limitations.`
` ......She has no concept of the limitations and losses caused by breaking and killing.`
`...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes start playing by jumping over the gap between life and death `
`like it's a game.`
` .........That is a very, very frightening thing.`
` So as an Endless Witch, and out of my own desire, `
`I never reached your level."`
`Virgilia had wanted to tell Beato that for a long time.`
` But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.`
` She had been too wild.`
`...She had been possessed by that detestable pleasure.`
`"......I have been told not to break vases.`
` ...But that's why I wanted to break them. `
`.........Then I gained the Endless Magic.`
` ...When I knew that I could fix it back to normal no matter how badly I broke it, `
`......I was surprised at how fun it was to break a vase..."`
`"That is called the forbidden honey.`
` People are not captivated by what's inside.`
` They are captivated by the sealed lock.`
` .........It truly is deplorable."`
`".........I want to ask you, Virgilia.`
` Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
` ...And for what purpose does it exist in this world?"`
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.`
` ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world. `
`......After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler-kun, ......but in order to bring blessings to the human world, `
`we witches are supposed to become a bridge between humans and those who are not human, and continue to study."`
`"......How does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"`
`"When a vase that is an important memento is broken, `
`if by fixing it, everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.`
` However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.`
` ......I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."`
`"In that case, `
`............Beato.`
` You fail as an Endless Witch."`
`"........................H, ......mmm..."`
`"......By now, I have, at times, vaguely thought about something.`
` .........Why do I keep going on with this strange game against you?`
`......This isn't a game to make me surrender.`
`......Couldn't it be a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch, in its true meaning?"`
`"...I, .........I don't know about that.`
` ...The reason I proposed this game to you was, umm, ......simply as a way to kill time...`
` No one was anticipating it."`
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from Virgilia.`
` By that definition, you, Beato, `
`are not even a witch.`
` You'd be an apprentice who's in the middle of her training, and who misunderstands her own power.`
`......This was supposedly a fight between a witch and a human.`
` In that case, someone like you, who isn't a witch, is not qualified to be my opponent.`
` .........Understand?"`
`"......You say, `
`......I am still, `
`............only an apprentice...... `
`Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?`
` ......When can we resume this game?"`
`"............Who knows.`
` ...At the very least, it isn't now. `
`......When you fully understand what I've said, and become a real witch,`
` ...I will probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."`
`"I, I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that...`
` Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."`
`"No, I've said enough.`
` You think about the rest.`
` .........That's all I want to say.`
` ...If you can't understand it, try talking with Virgilia and Ronove.`
` ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say.`
`............Virgilia.`
` Suspend the game for now.`
` Now that Ronove has stepped down as representative, `
`all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."`
`"......Understood.`
` ......Until Beato has been accepted as having gained those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.`
` Is that alright with you too, Beato?"`
`"...I, ......I have no objections. `
`.........I want time, and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.`
` ...May I leave my seat for that?"`
`".........Yeah, that's fine."`
`"...Well then, see you, later."`
`"Wait.`
` ......Don't make that dejected face."`
`".....................Sorry about that.`
` Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.`
` I cannot deceive."`
`"In that case, there's still room for improvement.`
` .........Let me promise you one thing.`
` In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.`
` ......If you don't come back, it'll probably be a victory by default for me."`
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.`
`...Then he spoke forcefully.`
`".........However, I definitely won't be the one to step down.`
` I definitely won't give you a victory by default.`
` ......I will keep on waiting here for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."`
`"......Battler-sama..."`
`"............Thank you, `
`Battler. `
`...I will definitely, come back and be accepted by you."`
`After showing a hopeful smile for a very short while, Beato hid herself.`
`...Looking at that expression, Battler strongly believed that her face wasn't lying...`
` The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.`
` By now, it was clear that those who had gone outside would not be able to return alive.`
` Rudolf's group had gone out holding two guns and one master key.`
` But those had been lost.`
` It was already clear that those had been stolen by the culprit.`
` Because the shutters were closed on the windows, they wouldn't open even if the culprit had the master key.`
` The front and back doors that led to the outside were all sealed by chains,`
` and they were further blocked with sofas and tables.`
` Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them.`
`"......At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.`
` If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."`
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.`
` I'm not sure you can call that a cloud's silver lining."`
`"......Eva-san, how do you feel?`
` Please, try to take it easy."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I still feel a fever, but now isn't the time to talk about that.`
` ......Now is not the time to fall asleep, for the children's sake as well."`
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's corpse,`
` Eva had felt a strong self-awareness that she was a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.`
`...Actually, her fever still hadn't gone down.`
` And she was aware of that.`
` If she didn't keep a strong hold on herself, she felt as though the fever would make her mind hazy again.`
` By this point, the first floor was a final line of defense made by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.`
` The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to carelessly go downstairs.`
` If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from the second floor.`
` But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an insecure position.`
` The second floor was safe compared to the first.`
` Battler and George had hoped they could also remain on the first floor, to fight in the worst case scenario, but Eva had rejected that.`
` In her mind, George was now the only member of her family.`
` It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.`
` Krauss and Natsuhi could also understand that feeling.`
`......Since this siege began, a great deal of time had passed.`
` In the second floor cousins' room, Battler, George, and Jessica were dazed, `
`and didn't even listen to the TV that had been left on.`
` For a while, Nanjo had been with them, and had tried to send them words of encouragement,`
` but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he had hid himself in his own room on the same second floor.`
` George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.`
`......It was from that time he had taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.`
` Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photographs.`
`......George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind, `
`and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken as clearly as though it had been yesterday.`
` So to George, they weren't simply photos,`
` but a door to bring back warm memories...`
` In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing,`
` ......it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her and her laughing voice that reached his eyes and his ears...`
` George had strived to be reborn after meeting Shannon.`
` He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been, `
`easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him.`
`......He had resolved himself to become a strong man who would make her life even more joyous.`
` Therefore.`
` ...If he hadn't met Shannon, `
`......the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.`
` And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he is now.`
` Even though I now exist for Shannon's sake.`
`......Even so, now that Shannon is gone, `
`...why do I exist? `
`It's completely meaningless, isn't it?`
`...A deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.`
` That feeling should have tormented him the whole time.`
` ......However, until Battler had told him, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself.`
`......He finally remembered, ...that he should have cried much, much more.`
` So he cried.`
` Just like Battler had, he had cried himself dry.`
`......By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he could not cry any more.`
` So George did his best to change his way of thinking.`
` He was not meaningless now, ...and he should be grateful that Shannon had given him such a character.`
` Dead lives are not revived.`
` He would have to get over being separated from his most beloved person.`
` If he were to chase after Shannon and kill himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.`
`......It worked the other way around, too.`
` If he had died, and Shannon had chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't have been able to forgive it himself.`
`......So he had chosen to surpass his emotions of sadness and anger,`
` .........and had decided to thank her.`
` He had met with Shannon, who had made his days rich and full,`
` ...and who had taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes.`
` As a result, she had shaped him into the person he had admired.`
`...He thought he should thank her for that.`
` By doing that, he tried to quell his sadness.`
` But each time he did, he remembered Shannon's face...`
`.........He understood the reasoning.`
` Even though he understood that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven, `
`......he couldn't stop his sadness...`
`"Why is it, `
`.........that when people die, `
`......it's so sad like this..."`
`Battler muttered.`
`...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.`
` He probably hadn't been asking anyone, but Jessica answered.`
`"......No matter how you say your farewell, it's always sad. `
`...But, when, for example, the person is old, or there's some time,`
` ...when it's expected in advance, and you know it's a farewell that must come sooner or later, `
`that sadness can grow fainter over a long period of time.`
` ......Sudden misfortune is probably sad, ...because you aren't allowed even that..."`
`"............I see.`
` So, if they get sick or something, and end up bedridden in a hospital, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit, `
`...but when it happens suddenly on some day, you don't have that much free time."`
`"...The sadness which normally should grow weaker over a period of several years closes in on you all at once.`
` .........That's pretty tough.`
` ......Sometimes, it might even cause a great sadness that leaves a scar for life..."`
`"......Enough to leave a scar for life, ...you say."`
`"......It's like Grandfather's occult hobby.`
` People whisper about it.`
` ......That Beatrice was his mistress, who died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together.`
` ......Some people whisper, `
`......that this is why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to research of the occult, in order to revive the dead."`
`"In that case, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.`
` ......The culprit is the revived Beatrice, and Grandfather was reunited with her at the moment he was killed.`
` Pretty ironic that he revived her, and was then killed by her."`
`".........Even so, Grandfather was probably able to meet her.`
` ...He gambled half of his life and, even though it was only for a short time, `
`he was reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."`
`"...Although he was completely roasted.`
` Feels like that result doesn't quite add up to the cost of researching for half of his life."`
`"That's not true.`
` .........Even if it was only for an instant,`
` ......Grandfather should have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved.`
`.........Even if his crime of going against divine providence was punished by God,`
` and his body was burnt and sent down to hell, `
`...even if that reunion only lasted a very short time, right...?"`
`"George nii-san......"`
`"......It doesn't matter if I meet with the wrath of God and have my body burned.`
` .........Even if it's just a short amount of time, `
`......if I could revive Shannon again,`
` ...............I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather.`
` ......Five minutes would be enough, `
`......because I want to talk with Shannon again...`
`......Even one minute would be fine......`
`......In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind, ......sacrificing the rest of my life......!"`
`".........Aniki......"`
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was giving George painful feelings, they could do nothing more than shut their mouths...`
`......George directed his thoughts at Kinzo's life.`
` He had sacrificed half of his life to research that no one could understand.`
`......And, on the last day of his life, he had revived the person he loved most, `
`......and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.`
` George didn't know how much time they had spent together.`
`...He didn't know whether they had been given an hour, ...or just five minutes.`
` However, ......in that moment, all of that time he had sacrificed for his research should have been rewarded.`
`...Even though he spent dozens of years to gain it, that small amount of time was probably enough to reward him.`
` Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.`
` Somewhere in my heart, `
`...I even made fun of Grandfather's research as nothing more than a pastime.`
` However, `
`......I won't make fun of it anymore.`
`...No, to the contrary, I strongly believe that it does exist.`
`...If the power of belief can become miracles, `
`I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today, `
`and spend the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.`
`.........Give me the power of magic.`
`...And, a miracle which lets me meet Shannon again...`
`"........................`
`......Haha, ...ha.`
` ...Sorry, you two.`
` What am I talking about?`
` ......If you could revive the dead with magic, `
`......people would probably be studying it everywhere around the world.`
` ...But things like that don't exist in reality.`
` No one studies it.`
` .........That's because, ...they know that the dead can't be revived with magic.`
` ............Sorry for saying something so weird.`
` It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.`
` ...Sorry for making you worry, even though this is tough for everybody."`
`...Even though I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.`
` If I keep talking about something so weird, I'm sure it won't heal their sadness...`
` But, just because of that, ...it doesn't mean that I can withstand this silence.`
`"......I'll go downstairs, and get another cup of coffee. `
`......My mother is obsessed with making coffee.`
` Does anyone want a refill?"`
`Battler-kun and Jessica-chan lightly shook their heads.`
` Without being any more persistent than that, I took my mug and left the room.`
` Because the shutters were all closed in the hallway, the corridor was very dim.`
` I tried visiting Doctor Nanjo's room and asking whether he needed more coffee,`
` but he said that he didn't need any more either.`
`......It seemed as though my mother's orthodox method of making coffee wasn't universally appreciated.`
` One time, I had Shannon drink it, `
`...but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong...`
`............Shannon.........`
` That's no good...`
`......even though I left the room to change my mood, `
`...that image of Shannon's face that's filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest...`
` The fun days with her are repeating vividly, `
`............and it's saddening that I haven't even been able to see her dead face.`
` According to our parents, it seems as though she was killed with something like a gun or spear.`
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ......but they had said that her dead face had been very beautiful and peaceful.`
` I wonder if she put the engagement ring I gave her last night, ...on her finger?`
`......If she had accepted my engagement, she should have put it on the ring finger of her left hand...`
` Last night, we were both on the edge of losing it, and not calm at all.`
` Shannon had accepted the engagement courageously, `
`but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.`
` She might have taken the ring off.`
`......I wonder if she has the ring on now.`
`......I at least want to be sure of that much.`
` I want to know...her final feelings......`
` However, ......even if I do check that, ...she won't be revived.`
`............I wonder what will happen to her body.`
` After the autopsy, ......it will probably be immediately cremated.`
` Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...`
`"............`
`.........Haha, ...because of the shock of losing Shannon, `
`......am I going a little crazy...?"`
`I don't want, ......to burn Shannon's body.`
` If she is burned, she'll turn to ash, ......and never again will it be possible for her to revive.`
` They say that cremation is disliked in western tradition.`
`......Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.`
` Because of that, it seems that great criminals in western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,`
` and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...`
` In other words, to western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.`
` It is essential that the corpse is left after death.`
`"In other words, `
`that's because, `
`......western people, `
`......knew of the existence of a miracle to revive the dead. `
`.........But because that miracle doesn't exist in Japan, we burn them."`
`Now I understand.`
` ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the western occult.`
` From the beginning, it had all been only for that reason.`
`...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the western occult.`
`.........Now, the situation surrounding us is abnormal.`
` Grandfather revived his beloved Beatrice.`
`...And, that Beatrice has carried out a terrible serial murder, `
`with linked closed rooms which forced us to think that magic had been used.`
`......The Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` The incarnation of the miracle of the western occult.`
`.........And also, the culprit who killed Shannon......`
` I should hate that being, ............and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to her.`
` I wonder, ...if Shannon could be revived with the magic of miracles, which Grandfather bet his life on...`
` According to the legend of the Ushiromiya family, Grandfather met with her long ago, and was given a vast quantity of gold.`
`...Then if I also meet her, `
`......instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life? `
`As collateral, she could impose any kind of devil's contract.`
` For that, I could sacrifice all of my remaining life...`
` George probably couldn't believe or notice that his voiceless wish, `
`...was heard by the witch herself, standing right behind him.`
` Beatrice had been listening to the children's discussion just now in the cousins' room the whole time.`
`......Battler had told her that she didn't know the value of a human's life,`
` ......and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, and listened to their discussion.`
`"..................`
`......That is your wish, you say...?`
` If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"`
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.`
`...She had handed over most of her previously surging magic power when the new witch had succeeded the name of Endless Witch.`
` Of course, her current magic power still made her worthy of being called a witch, `
`...but it did not even compare to her previous strength.`
`"......Hmm.`
` Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has been thundered for a thousand years.`
` Reviving the dead is no trouble at all."`
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical steps she could take to revive the dead.`
`......Even magic that should have been easy in the past would be difficult with her current magic power.`
` She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, and repeated this several times.`
` In the end, ......she finally thought of a single magic.`
` But that was a magic that she couldn't use by herself.`
` It was a magic that witches with weak power used, that relied on the aid of others.`
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.`
` Therefore, she frantically tried to think if there wasn't any other possible magic, `
`.........but in the end, she couldn't think of one, and slumped over in self-derision.`
` And then, ......careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.`
` Softly, to George's heart...`
`".........Ushiromiya George.`
` ...Can you hear my voice...?"`
`"......I can hear.`
` ......Who are you...?`
` Are you really the witch, Beatrice...?`
` ...Or else, are you an illusion created by my sadness...?`
`.........If it's the former, I want you to hear my wish.`
` ...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..."`
`Their conversation in a mental world was a lot like having one in a dream.`
` When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience...`
` of casually accepting something that would have been absurd in the real world?`
`......The conversation in this world was like that.`
` So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...`
`"Hmm.`
` ......I am...the Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
` .........Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together like this.`
` ...However, you are strongly conscious of me, and wish to have a discussion, `
`...so both of our channels are able to match like this."`
`"............I don't care whether the person who killed Shannon was...`
` you, or someone else taking on your name.`
` ......As long as you exist as a real witch...`
`............I would pay any compensation.`
` If you desire my life, you can take it right now.`
` ......Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...`
`.........If that's impossible, I don't mind if you just let me talk to her for a short while......`
`......Please........."`
`".........I require no compensation.`
` I shall grant that wish."`
`"...Really......?`
` Really, for Shannon.........?"`
`"Hmm.`
` ......However, my current magic power is not sufficient to use resurrection magic.`
` ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."`
`".........If there's something I can do, I'll do anything.`
` ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."`
`"...I'm telling you that I don't require something like that.`
` ............I will chant the magic.`
` Then, a gap will open in the door to Hades.`
`...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap.`
` .........However, if it were you, who has strong feelings for Shannon, `
`those feelings should change into magic and bring her soul out without fail.`
`......What do you say?`
` Will you help me...?"`
`"...I will help.`
` .........If Shannon's life will be revived, `
`......I am not afraid to lose everything......!"`
`George's fists shook in silence.`
`...Then he slowly regained consciousness.`
` He had been absent-mindedly standing near the window in the hall the whole time, his mug still in his hand...`
` And......, `
`............the witch from his dream, ......was still there.`
`"Wh, ......what the, .........i, it isn't, ......a dream........."`
`"......Be quiet.`
` I am very fragile now.`
` If any more humans appear now, I will not be able to preserve this form.`
` ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.`
` ...Is that alright?"`
`George covered his mouth with both hands, forcefully nodding several times.`
` In that instant, it looked as though the mug he was holding was about to fall.`
` George frantically juggled it around and caught it.`
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,`
` the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping.`
` He softly set the mug on the floor, ...and stared at the witch in front of him again.`
`.........Her form didn't disappear.`
` It wasn't a dream......`
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.`
` With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."`
`"Y, you say go, but how...?`
` My mother and the rest are downstairs.`
` There's no way they'd let us go outside.`
` ......And, didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another human appeared?"`
`"......Come to think of it, that is true.`
` So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.`
` ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down. `
`......Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going down to the first floor, right?`
` It's simple."`
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.`
`......And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.`
` When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.`
` Then the window opened without a sound.`
` The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.`
` The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.`
` The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.`
`...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.`
` Because of that, for a while, `
`George felt as though this entrance opening to the outside was a dream or illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real.`
`"Come, let us go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato gently floated upwards.`
` It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.`
`......It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did, `
`you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming in the water.`
`...No, George did believe that.`
`......So without thinking, just as she had done, he also..., `
`...gently, `
`......as though swimming in the water, his feet......`
`"......ah, ............aaaaaaahh........."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Not bad.`
` So you learned how to dance in the sky faster than I could explain it."`
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.`
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who shouldn't have been able to use magic, had learned how to do that just by instinct.`
`".........To be able to, `
`......fly in the air, `
`......swim in the air......"`
`"...You must not think of the reason.`
` Accept it as a natural thing.`
` ......You must not think back upon the human doctrines, such as those from Newton and Einstein.`
` Especially when flying high in the sky.`
` ...Inexperienced witches sometimes fall."`
`"...I, I accept it as true...`
` I accept it as true......"`
`George repeated those words over and over.`
`......He must not deny magic, no matter what.`
` Denying that would be like throwing away what might be `
`his first and last chance to revive Shannon.`
` However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements were clearly similar to someone underwater.`
`...Therefore, if he didn't act like he was kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he would be caught by the force of gravity bit by bit.`
`"I shall praise this as being a better performance than the first time I danced in the sky. `
`......Here we go.`
` Come with me."`
`When Beato beckoned to George, she gently flew into the stormy sky.`
`......It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.`
` The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.`
`"......Being able to fly is, ......incredible, ......but so is the wind and the rain..."`
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?`
` ......I could teach you magic to block against that, `
`but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."`
`"..................Yes.`
` ...The magic I need...isn't that."`
`Without losing to the wind and rain, George wore a strong-willed gaze.`
`"The mansion is coming into sight.`
` ...Hold out just a little longer.`
` If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden."`
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes.`
` This illusion-like scene no longer surprised George.`
` Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.`
`"Shannon, .........wait for me...`
`......I will definitely...revive you......!"`
`At that time.`
` ......The cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.`
`"............Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` Just two more, and my obligation to that predecessor granny is finished.`
` .........I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` A close couple."`
`"Nihi.`
` Whe-re is the target nyeh?"`
`"......In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, both targets and Ushiromiya Eva aquired.`
` Anti-Magic Power Measurement.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410 Data Received.`
` Anti-magic power is extremely small.`
` If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board.`
` Nihihihihi...!"`
`"What do you think, great Lady Beatrice?`
` If you give the order, we will snipe right away...!`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"...You guys re-ally are convenient furniture. `
`Very different from old, second-hand furniture, which only has enough talent to gouge corpses.`
` Right?"`
`"........................Ku..."`
`"Siesta Sisters, please show me your skill again.`
` ...Firing Preparations!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Carry the corpses out again, alright?`
` 'Cause I'll play with them a lot. `
`No complaints, right Ronove?"`
`"......Correct.`
` Certainly."`
`"Nn......"`
`At that time, the witch noticed something.`
`......As though some presence had disappeared...`
`...was it her imagination......?`
`".........Did you feel some kind of presence just now?`
` Did anyone feel it?"`
`"M, ...my apologies, I haven't noticed anything..., please forgive me......!!"`
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was set to off. Nihi. `
`...What about you, Lucifer-chaaan?`
` Did you feel a presence?"`
`".........Nn-"`
`For just an instant, Lucifer sent a glance at Ronove, asking whether she should answer honestly or not.`
` Ronove gave a small nod in response.`
`"No.`
` ...My apologies, Beatrice-sama.`
` Nothing from us. `
`.........Forgive us for this stupidity, as we are only second-hand furniture."`
`"........................"`
`"........................"`
`"........................`
`......I see.`
` If a great demon like you says that, then it must have been my imagination."`
`The witch persistently stared in the direction the presence had disappeared to.`
`......That was the direction of the rose garden.`
` And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette creating by lightning.`
`......It took her quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside, `
`and once again faced the guesthouse.`
