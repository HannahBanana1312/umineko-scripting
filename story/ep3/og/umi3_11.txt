`".........This way?`
` ......Go this way............?`
` They are, ......inviting me to go this way........."`
`......!!! `
`My heart leapt.`
`...Because there, ............gaping wide, ...was an opened mouth in the eerie darkness.`
`"Wh, .........what's this...`
` What is this......?!"`
`When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.`
`......In addition, there was a switch with open and close written on it.`
` When I resolutely pushed the switch, `
`rough lights, like you'd find in a coal mine, turned on sporadically, `
`making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into vision...`
` It was creepy how it now looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.`
` Other than the light switch, there was also a switch with open and close written on it.`
`...It would probably open or close this, but on the slight chance that the open part might be broken, `
`I might be closed up in this creepy underground area for all eternity...`
` So for the time being, I didn't touch the open/close switch, `
`......and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.`
` Because the ceiling was very high, it didn't feel cramped.`
` On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and that creepiness even felt like an aura...`
` As I readied my gun, and carefully stared forwards, ......I went down the stairs......`
` The walls, the stairs, the lights, ...all of them were very old-fashioned.`
`...It's easy to suspect that this had been made at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on this island.`
` There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.`
` That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.`
` As though it was telling me to go faster...`
` The staircase kept turning back on itself.`
` I don't know how far down I've gone, but I think it's much deeper than one floor.`
` And eventually, ............a rough, metal door showed itself.`
` And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.`
` ...They had probably been written a long time ago.`
`'{p:1:At the tenth twilight, the journey shall end, and you should reach the village of gold.}'`
`My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I recognized those deep-red characters...`
` There's no mistake...`
` This is the last stop.`
`.........Father's, ......Golden Land...!! `
`I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied the gun again.`
`...But since, in the end, I couldn't open the door with my gun held in both hands...`
`......I lowered the gun, carefully erased my breath, and opened the door......`
`"..................Th, ......this place, ......is......?!"`
`My first impression when I saw the room, `
`......was that it might be related to one of the rooms in the mansion.`
` That's right, it had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the sealed VIP room on the second floor.`
` But this was underground, so there were no windows.`
` There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.`
` But even though it was dimly lit by the faint light, `
`the quality of the interior was more than enough to take your breath away.`
` A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be comfortable to sit in.`
` An extravagant sofa and carpet.`
` The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...`
` And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows, `
`how could you say it, it felt like it could be the hidden house of a witch.`
` I had never swallowed the legend of Beatrice, witch of the forest.`
` However, ......after being shown this room, `
`......it certainly became hard to doubt that she actually had existed,`
` and had lived in this room.`
`".........Is someone, `
`..................there...?"`
`Even though I was completely shocked by this room, I carefully, `
`...no, timidly searched the interior with my gun raised.`
` And, ......in the center of the room, I found it.`
`"............Eeek, ............"`
`My gasp came out strangely, as though a bunny was being choked.`
`...Because, ......after finding something like this,`
` ...no one would be able to stop that kind of stupid voice from leaking out...`
`"It's here......`
`......I, it's really here.........`
`......Father's, ......gold......!!"`
`On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...`
` It was a mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!! `
`Of course, they weren't piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.`
` A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold, `
`creating a beautiful three-colored mix between the red, the gold and the black of the deep darkness...`
` It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,`
` the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.`
` Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.`
` It was attentively piled there with an imposing air...`
` When I tried to grab a single gold ingot, I was surprised at its weight.`
`......It was probably about 10 kilograms.`
`......Just this ingot would probably be worth more than 10 million.`
` The Ushiromiya family crest, the One-winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.`
` It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place, `
`but it was certainly the crest of the One-winged Eagle.`
` Just how many ingots were piled up here? `
`By just going from one part to another randomly and judging by the height, there was surely more than several hundred.`
` My mind is already blank, so I can't do a good calculation.`
`......Even a moderate guess would put it above several billion yen.`
`"That's right..., of course...`
`...After all, there's 10 tons of gold, right...?`
` At the current value, that's more than 20 billion yen of gold, right...?`
` I, ...I found it, ......before anyone else, .........I found it!!`
` Ahaha, wahahahahahahaha, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.`
` A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.`
` I had no intention of laughing in a weird way, `
`...but, but, I couldn't hold back the happy feeling that flowed throughout my entire body.`
`......My older brother probably wouldn't accept his loss just because I had found this gold.`
`...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find the gold...! `
`To steal the headship of the family, I would still probably need some subtle tactics.`
` But after everything I've gone through until now, that's a completely trivial problem.`
` Even if I lost out on the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family and everything...`
`...I already have 20 billion yen worth of gold!!`
`"Hahahaha, a-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!`
` I did think that money was such a worthless thing.`
` I'd thought that there are many things in this world that you can't buy with money.`
` ...But now I understand that that's just a lie!`
` That's just an excuse that those who don't have it make for themselves!! `
`In front of this mountain of gold, I've finally realized something so obvious...!!`
` By using this money, I can give birth to all the happiness in this world!`
` With this money, my husband's company is already fine.`
` We will always be happy as a family.`
` And I can even leave a vast amount of money to George...!! `
`The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.`
` At that time, George will use this gold, `
`and just like Grandfather did,`
` he will revive the Ushiromiya family's lost honor.`
` ......George is the true successor of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`It happened!!!`
` My wish was granted!! `
`That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva, has been granted completely in this very moment...!! `
`My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.`
` And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!! `
`There's no way I'll waste it on foolish pleasures!! `
`My older brother has chewed up the Ushiromiya family, but George and I will revive it! `
`And that means that I truly have succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family!!`
`"I was successful...`
` I did it, ...dear..., George...`
`......I, ......finally succeeded, ......as a mother...`
`......After this, we won't be threatened by anyone...`
` Whaaaaaa, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`That's right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.`
` Congratulations, me.`
` Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`......Right here, right now, the sad half of our life will have its heart's desire granted.`
`"It's all thanks to you...`
` I was given this chance because of your magic.`
` Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"`
`...Thank you.`
` But my magic couldn't have been granted if we both didn't believe in each other.`
` So it isn't just the power of my magic.`
` This is our victory.`
` Because of that, congratulations,`
` 'us'.`
`"Thank you, me...`
` Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...`
`......I'm glad I didn't give in before now.`
` I'm glad that I didn't drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling...`
`.........No, this is my magic.`
` Our magic!`
` Your magic was the real thing.`
` Beatrice, the witch of the forest, is nothing more than an illusion.`
` You are the real witch, who can use real magic.`
` ......That's right.`
` Right now, you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!"`
`Eva decided to leave that place for the time being.`
` When she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...`
`......She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.`
`"..................Who is it?!"`
`For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real Beatrice, had appeared.`
` It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.`
` The two of them were pointing guns at each other.`
` And eventually, they each realized who the other was...`
`".........Rosa.........?"`
`"...Nee-san...`
`.........What are you doing in a place like this...?"`
`"That's my line.`
` What business do you have in a place such as this?"`
`"......I shouldn't have given you that hint, Nee-san.`
` If I hadn't, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.`
` .........Too bad."`
`It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went, `
`and what was waiting ahead of her.`
`"So you say.`
` .........Even though I reached this place before you."`
`".........I worried too much about the sweetfish river.`
` The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?"`
`"That isn't true.`
` It was an excellent hint, wasn't it? `
`Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.`
` ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."`
`"......What is inside?"`
`"Why not see with your own eyes?`
` It definitely won't betray your expectations."`
`"............`
`......Don't be afraid, Nee-san.`
` I never had any interest in who became the head.`
` I don't even care about the Ushiromiya family name.`
` ......Honestly, I actually feel good about you stealing the position of head from Krauss,`
` who was always swaggering around because of it."`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.`
` ......Even if Father had named me as the next head,`
` there's no way Nii-san would accept that.`
` I try not to have such naive dreams."`
`"........................"`
`"Let me see too.`
` The proof of your victory, Nee-san.`
` ......As long as I receive the proper portion that the siblings agreed upon,`
` I plan to actively accept you as the true victor in this 'game'."`
`"............If you shoot me, then you would have this gold all to yourself, right?"`
`"It's the same for you.`
` If you shoot me, this gold would all be yours."`
`"........................"`
`For a tense moment, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.`
` Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other's eyes, they lowered their guns.`
`...Eva removed her finger from the trigger, and held the gun upside-down.`
` It was a position that she couldn't quickly shoot from.`
` When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.`
`"......That's right.`
` That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is fascinating for both of us. `
`...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it's isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.`
` ......If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn't be found easily, but that isn't for certain."`
`".........No matter how many billion yen worth of gold is on the line,`
` it isn't worth the risk of committing murder.`
` In the end, that would become an excuse for Krauss nii-san and the others to take advantage of us."`
`"I agree.`
` ......It may have been a blessing in disguise that you were the one to show up, `
`......instead of Nii-san or Rudolf.`
` ...I trust you the most of all the siblings."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I also trust you the most of the siblings, Nee-san."`
`"........................"`
`"............I want to see the gold too."`
`"Do you?`
` Now I also want to see it again.`
` Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn't feel real.`
` ...Unless I see it together with you and check once more that it actually exists,`
` it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."`
`Eva started descending the staircase once more.`
`......However, she didn't carelessly expose her back to Rosa.`
` Even though, at a glance, it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn't show any signs of carelessness.`
`......And they reached that room of the witch once again.`
` Rosa also gasped, made speechless by the vast amount of gold...`
`......Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.`
` They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned.`
` They had to regain their sense of tension soon.`
`"......Congratulations, Nee-san."`
`"Thank you."`
`"You decided it, didn't you Nee-san?`
` 50% goes to the title of the successor to the head.`
` ......It sure did work out well for you.`
` Now, that portion isn't Krauss nii-san's.`
` ...So your share is now 50% along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen.`
` Isn't that an incredible share?`
` ...I'm satisfied with 2.5 billion.`
` Rudolf nii-san won't complain either.`
` Krauss nii-san will probably be the only one to complain."`
`"......Yeah, you're right.`
` ...After all, Nii-san is the practical manager of Rokkenjima.`
` And since the gold was on these premises, `
`even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don't handle it skillfully."`
`"It won't get complicated.`
` Didn't we give it our all in that discussion last night with that in mind?"`
`"............I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.`
` I've already completely gotten over my excitement.`
` How we regulate everything from here on is the real problem."`
`"...That is a problem for the new head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` You should enjoy that problem, Nee-san.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"Hmm, so you say..."`
`"......I'll support you as the second person to find it.`
` If you would at least give me the early payment we decided on.`
` I'd like 150 million yen by March."`
`"Yes, that's fine.`
` ......If you support me, I can graciously pay you that much.`
` I am not Nii-san."`
`"Anyway, why don't we go and shock Nii-san and the others?`
` Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii-san's shocked face as soon as I can."`
`"............`
`............Wait a second, Rosa.`
` Wait a while before telling everyone about it."`
`"...............HuhHuh?`
` ...Why?"`
`"...You idiot, isn't it obvious?`
` ...This is that haughty Krauss nii-san and that sly Rudolf we're talking about.`
` Even if we announce it eventually, it's still too early now.`
` Unless we carefully investigate how we should move things along first, `
`it's possible that all of the gold we've finally found will be snatched away by Nii-san."`
`Eva had tried to say it as though it was completely obvious.`
`...So when she saw Rosa's expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.`
`"......What are you unsatisfied about?`
` You should also know what kind of a person Krauss nii-san is."`
`"............`
` Nee-san, that's against the rules."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"......Didn't we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?`
` If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed, `
`and that could lead to something worse in the future.`
` ...With Krauss nii-san as crafty as he is, `
`that violation of the rules will grow worse with time."`
`"That's stupid.`
` This is Nii-san's island.`
` And that gold just now wasn't cash.`
` We're talking about the liquidation of a vast 10 ton mountain, right? `
`It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.`
` And that will only work in Nii-san's favor, since he has practical control over this island.`
` Don't you even realize that?!"`
`"..................I don't like it when you search each other for weaknesses like that.`
` I just want to clearly specify my 2.5 billion portion.`
` Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now, `
`whatever you did next would be up to you.`
` But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings' rules."`
`"You're so naive...`
` You don't understand Nii-san's craftiness at all!"`
`......It wasn't that Rosa didn't understand the craftiness of her older siblings.`
` In that sense, Rosa more or less understood Eva's caution.`
` But in her heart, `
`she couldn't clear away her suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.`
`......Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings.`
` In other words, Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself, `
`by quickly informing the siblings of the gold's discovery...`
`"............`
`......Rosa.`
` Sorry, but at least listen to me this once."`
`".........Are you saying that if I don't listen to what you say, you won't be able to prepare the 150 million?"`
`"............`
`...That isn't the way I wanted to say it.`
` ...But if you really need that money, it's more realistic to support me.`
` ......If you talk to Nii-san and Rudolf, even that natural portion of yours might disappear.`
` You don't want that, do you?"`
`"....................."`
`For a while, a severe expression that she had never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa's face.`
` There wasn't even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.`
`......There was just the ruthlessness, `
`no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.`
` Eva made light of it, chuckling.`
`"......My, my.`
` How careless we must be to stand around here talking like this,`
` even though a frightful murder case has just taken place, and the culprit still may be on this island."`
`"I'm sure it's just the servants' farce.`
` No murder case ever occurred on this island."`
`"......Oh.`
` So you really do think that?"`
`"It can be clearly explained by the manner of the six deaths.`
` The closed room with those six people definitely couldn't be created by a crime from the outside.`
`......Doctor Nanjo said that they were all dead, but that was also a lie.`
` This is all a complicated act that Father plotted.`
` All of the servants are just pretending to be dead.`
` ...A murder never occurred in the first place.`
` There's no way that there's a murderer prowling around."`
`"...Aha.`
` I'm surprised that you would notice that.`
` You looked fairly frightened, so I hadn't thought that you realized that much."`
`"......I'm a person who can read between the lines in that kind of situation.`
` Thanks to that, I've been well trained."`
`That's right.`
` Come to think of it, now that the servants are 'dead', everyone on this island is a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And after Nanjo had proclaimed the 'deaths' of the servants,`
` when the relatives had begun to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he had disappeared off to the second floor as though he was in the way...`
`"Everything...`
` is an act to get us to challenge that epitaph.`
` ......Therefore,`
` you need to proclaim that you are the victor, Nee-san.`
` There's no way that burnt corpse is really Father.`
` ......He prepared a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere, and went to all the trouble of burning it for his nasty hobby."`
`"......I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, watching to see how we'll behave.`
` ...I'm sure he already knows that you have reached the Golden Land, Nee-san.`
`......Therefore, you should proclaim that you are the winner soon.`
` I'm sure Father will appear out of nowhere and proclaim that you are his successor while clapping his hands."`
`"............................................."`
`"...Well, still.`
` ......I have to pester you for 150 million, `
`so I can't work against you in anything."`
`".........So you'll listen to what I say, and be quiet about this to Nii-san and the rest...?"`
`"........................"`
`"......Make your position clear.`
` ...Rosa."`
`"............I want to tell them.`
` We just made that rule last night.`
` We shouldn't just throw that away."`
`"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.`
` ...However, I want to closely inspect the situation first.`
` Carrying out 10 tons of gold, converting it into money,`
` and a fair distribution.`
`......Until I have proof that I can carry that out without Nii-san getting in the way, I want some time to think.`
` I only want to hold off my announcement until then.`
` .........I'm definitely not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."`
`"............`
`...You'll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"`
`"...Yes, of course.`
` I also want to rub it in Nii-san's face as soon as I can."`
`".........About how much time will you need to think?"`
`"I won't know that until I've thought about it."`
`"............Would one night be enough?"`
`"I can't promise you that it will take only one night...!"`
`"Out of respect for the next head, I will support you for one night.`
` ......This year's family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.`
` ...That's right, when the seagulls cry.`
` ......I will remain silent until then.`
` If you think that you need more time to think after that, ...let's talk about it again at that time, alright?`
`.........I will support your position `
`as much as possible."`
`"...........................You, ......really are cunning, aren't you?`
` ...I'm surprised.`
` Were you always this sturdy?"`
`"......It's true that women become stronger when they have a child.`
` I realized that in myself when I had Maria."`
`"............`
` Understood.`
` I thank you for your cooperation for the time being.`
` ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......I believe that you will be a fair-minded successor to the head, who wouldn't even think of taking all of the gold for herself."`
`"...Isn't that obvious!`
` ......I will split the gold evenly among the siblings."`
`No way. I found this.`
` Because I, we solved the riddle of the epitaph! `
`So this gold is all mine...!!`
`"I won't give it up to anyone! `
`I am the head of the Ushiromiya family! `
`I am, "I" am!!"`
`The witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession in a loud voice.`
`...Of course, that didn't reach even close to Rosa's ears, and it probably didn't reach Eva's either.`
`"......Hmm.`
` I shall acknowledge that.`
` You are the true head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch's epitaph.`
` Now, I shall acknowledge that upon my name."`
`"...Y, `
`.........you are.........?`
` That outfit, `
`you couldn't be, `
`......really, `
`...Beatrice......?"`
`Maybe Beatrice was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.`
` She cackled pleasantly.`
` In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies crept up as though a storm of gold dust was spinning around the room, `
`and the room shone the color of gold...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`......*cackle*cackle*, there is nothing that should frighten you so.`
` I am praising your exploits.`
` ...Truly excellent.`
` Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...`
` It is worthy of my admiration...!"`
`"...You were the one who sent that letter?`
` So I'll succeed all of the gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance, right...?`
` You wrote that in your letter.`
` And I overcame that challenge...!"`
`"Hmmm.`
` I shall acknowledge it.`
` Now, all of this piled up gold, everything of the Ushiromiya family, is for you to do with as you please.`
` After all, from this moment on, you are already the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"R, ......really?`
` It's true, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Do not be agitated.`
` I am openly praising you.`
` As proof, I shall grant you this."`
`Beatrice took a ring off of her own finger, `
`and held it out to Eva.`
` She fearfully accepted it, `
`......and realized that it was a ring.`
`"......C, `
`......could........., `
`this be............"`
`"Hmm.`
` It is the proof of the Ushiromiya family headship, returned to me from Kinzo, the Golden Ring. `
`From now on, it is yours.`
` You may put it on your finger and display it high before your siblings.`
` No one should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance."`
`Eva stared closely at the ring.`
`...It certainly wasn't a fake.`
`...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.`
` She had dreamed of receiving this ring someday, `
`focused on this day over and over again, and it was now finally a certainty.`
` This ring, `
`had now designated her as the head, `
`......and had been handed over to her......`
` And `
`timidly, `
`...she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...`
` In that instant, ......she felt a deep emotion piling up inside her that she had never felt before.`
` Her mind grew blank.`
` Both eyes were opened.`
` That ring, ...was on her own finger.`
` Not in a dream, in reality............!`
`"That ring is also pleased.`
` Because it was able to come to you and fit itself on your finger as it dreamed of doing."`
`"......The ring...`
`......Father's`
`......ring............!"`
`"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your own finger as you have done now?`
` ......The strength of those feelings became your magic and materialized itself.`
` Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a great witch."`
`"............W, ...who are you?`
` ...Are you really, ......Beatrice......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*. `
`I am the Golden Witch Beatrice!`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist! `
`Following my contract with Kinzo, I will now pass everything on to you.`
` ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.`
` And all of the wealth he built up through that.`
` And the honor and inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And, I will pass on my power and the title of the Endless Witch."`
`"......The title, `
`......of the witch......"`
`"I will pass on all of my magical power, and the title of the Golden Witch, the Endless Witch.`
` ......Following my Predecessor, I will hand over my name, Beatrice, along with that title. `
`......You may now call yourself by that name!"`
`Eva gulped.`
` The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.`
`"By my name, I shall now carry out the succession of the Golden Witch...!"`
`The instant that Beatrice made that proclamation, everything was buried by a golden sparkle,`
` ......and changed into a majestic place that looked like an audience hall.`
` In the audience hall, there was a crowd of Beatrice's minions and brethren, `
`as well as countless gold butterflies celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.`
` When she looked, she saw Beatrice in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff, `
`reigning with a dazzling dignity.`
` Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...`
` A goat attendant respectfully handed Beatrice a golden staff in the shape of the One-winged Eagle.`
` After Beatrice stood up and received that staff, `
`she lay the tip of it on Eva's shoulder and spoke.`
` It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.`
`"Ushiromiya Eva.`
` You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch's epitaph, and reached the Golden Land.`
` ......I praise that accomplishment, `
`and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden and Endless Witch.`
` From this point on, you may take my name, `
`Beatrice...!`
` Come, raise your face.`
` Then stand and accept this staff...!"`
`"I, ......I am most grateful..."`
`Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from Beatrice's hand.`
` Her hand was trembling slightly.`
` As soon as she grasped that staff.`
`......She was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.`
` As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.`
` In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.`
` To describe it in a word, it was energy.`
` Energy with a gold color.`
` It felt like she was waking up, `
`......as though she had been half asleep since she had been born and was opening her eyes for the first time.`
` It felt as though her true eyes inside her eyes were opened for the first time in her life.`
`".........Hmm.`
` A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch. `
`Come, you may show yourself to all of these people.`
` You may show them that you are now the new witch...!"`
`Eva, ......no, the new Beatrice turned around timidly.`
` When she did, the witch's minions, which filled the vast audience hall,`
` honored her with an applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea......`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Replace all of the portraits of Beatrice with the new Beatrice!`
` Lift up words of celebration for the new Beatrice...!!"`
`"New Beatrice.`
` Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a proud Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."`
`"Y, .........yes, ...I will do my best..."`
`"I expect a composure fitting for the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.`
` Hoh-hohohohoho."`
`"Teacheer, we're in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of that."`
`"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` New Beatrice-sama. `
`......I am called Ronove.`
` I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch.`
` If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, `
`please let me know at once."`
`"......Th, ......thank you......"`
`"Ronove is rude but reliable.`
` If you speak to this man of anything that confuses you in your new days as a witch, he should be able to help you."`
`".........And, predecessor Beatrice-sama,`
` it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this. `
`......These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.`
` I deeply thank you."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......One thousand years with you wasn't boring.`
` ...Please, take care of the new witch."`
`"Yes.`
` I, Ronove, `
`...will certainly listen to the predecessor Beatrice's`
` final order."`
`"Thank me, alright?`
` I signed to recommend you for the succession of the witch, alright?`
` In other words, if I hadn't signed, you wouldn't have been able to become the witch.`
` So thank me a little, alright?!"`
`"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` The recommendation of a witch from the senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.`
` Lady Lambdadelta recommended you, and became your guardian."`
`"Th, ......thank you......"`
`"......He-y, Beato-!`
` This kid isn't grateful enough!`
` I'll stop recommending her!"`
`"The person who recommended her shouldn't act like a child, right?`
` If you've signed, then just take responsibility."`
`"Lady Lambdadelta is also the Witch of Certainty.`
` ......The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.`
` She really liked and highly valued your efforts until today."`
`"Well, a misfortunate childhood, unrewarded effort...I can sympathize ju-st a bit with that.`
` It's not like I felt sorry for you or anything, don't be so full of yourself!`
` Tsu-n!"`
`"......From my point of view, your succession, well, it's more of a coincidence than a miracle.`
` It isn't worthy of my recommendation."`
`"*cackle*.`
` This is Lady Bernkastel.`
` She's a very hard-to-please person.`
` Still, you could say that just having her participate and celebrate is very fortunate."`
`".........I only came because this is a rare event after one thousand years.`
` And I heard that there would be some delicious sake."`
`"New Beatrice-sama.`
` Please, greet us as well."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ...I'm pleased to meet you..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were gathered in a line.`
` The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.`
`"These are furniture who serve me.`
` As a gift in celebration of your inheritance, I will send them to you. `
`......After you succeed the Golden Witch, you will also need to perform the resurrection ceremony for yourself.`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ceremony.`
` ......They're a villainous group, but they serve their purpose.`
` Have them do whatever you wish."`
`"We will always be by Beatrice-sama's side.`
` Please order us to do anything you wish.`
` We will certainly show that we can accomplish our task...!"`
`Even after that, various nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.`
` As she responded to them confusedly,`
` she felt as though she was getting light-headed due to lack of oxygen.`
`......She couldn't tell if this was something real or unreal.`
` But there was just one thing she could understand.`
` A feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.`
`...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...`
`"............What, ......is all this?`
` Of course, I'm not going to swallow this story, ...but what in the world does it mean?! `
`Eva oba-san is the new Beatrice?`
` Are you saying she's become a witch?`
` ......What the hell...!!"`
`"I was also surprised.`
` Imagine that someone would be able to solve that riddle. `
`......However, that is the rule.`
` I must follow it, and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."`
`"It is hardly something to be surprised about.`
` From the beginning, Milady wrote that rule in a letter and announced it. `
`......Eva-sama was the first to be successful.`
` That is all there is to say."`
`"......Virgilia, are you there?!"`
`"Yes, here I am..."`
`"What does this farce mean?!`
` Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!`
` ......Isn't this like Eva oba-san has become a witch?!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` She has simply received the title of 'Endless Witch', and might call herself that in the future.`
` ......This succession ceremony is certainly nothing more than an act to promote that child's 'explanation'.`
` Don't fall for the same move again."`
`"Th, ...that's right...`
` That whole grand ceremony was all phony.`
` But it's at least a fact that Eva oba-san solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......And at the same time, that means that she succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance.`
`......And by obtaining 10 tons of gold, `
`......it means that Eva oba-san might as well call herself the 'Golden Witch'..., is that it...?`
` Damn, it's as complicated as ever...!!"`
`"...My, my.`
` Is a boorish human unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?`
` ......Oh, well.`
` Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you human.`
` I pity you, but I do not blame you."`
`"Damn it...`
` Don't look at me like you feel sorry for me...`
`.........Still, for the time being, there's something I need to check.`
` And that's regarding this younger version of Eva oba-san,`
` ...in other words, the definition of this new Beatrice.`
` ......What is that?!"`
`"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, right?`
` So there's nothing in particular for me to explain.`
` You may believe that things are as you think they are."`
`"......The way I think things are...?!`
` Then, then how should I interpret this...?!"`
`"For now, grasping it as a visualization of a different being inside Ushiromiya Eva may not be a hinderance, I believe."`
`"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept it, but it is probably appropriate for you to think that way now."`
`"............I, in other words, I should think that Eva oba-san and her are the same person?`
` ......Damn, ...this is starting to feel bad..."`
`"In that case, from now on, my name is not Beatrice.`
` Because I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva. `
`......Which means that I am nameless!`
` Battleer, isn't there some name that is fitting for me?`
` I shall take your recommendation!`
` Isn't there a name that's refined, full of elegance, and make it a little cute if you can...!"`
`"...Just 'Beato' is good enough for you.`
` There's probably enough of a difference between Beato and Beatrice."`
`"M, ...muu.`
` Stay as Beato, is it...`
` It doesn't feel odd, but it's boring for some reason.`
` Muu."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku...`
` They say the temperature of black tea and a woman's heart are difficult in any time period."`
`".........Battler-kun.`
` Anyway, be calm after this.`
` Compared to when this child was Beatrice, `
`now that we can tell her apart from Ushiromiya Eva, the situation is advantageous to us."`
`"......And it's exactly because of that, `
`...that I like it even less.`
` ......What is she thinking of?`
` That Beato........."`
`Over there, the witches formed a long line to bless Eva oba-san,`
` who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name Beatrice.`
` It was like a witch's coronation.`
` The countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold-sparkling space.`
` They were all praising her.`
` As I stared from the distance, `
`I looked at the reborn Beatrice, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.`
`......Her expression, which had been confused at first,`
` seemed to be full of a happiness that she had finally become aware of.`
` In that expression, there wasn't a trace of the insane laugh from standing before the gold.`
` There was just an innocence which reflected upon her own joy.`
` Since I denied witches, I couldn't put on a joyful expression at this witch succession ceremony and accept her...`
`......However, when I looked at that innocent smile, `
`it made me feel like I wanted to bless that, just for now.`
` The moment when a strong effort is successful and rewarded is always beautiful.`
` Eva oba-san, who had always yearned to succeed the head, and had worked hard since she was young without being rewarded,`
` ......had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph, ...and had finally gained that position.`
` How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted? `
`I definitely won't accept witches.`
` But, ......Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.`
`*clap*. *clap*.`
`......It didn't reach her ears, ...but it did bless her.`
`".........Congratulations, Eva oba-san."`
`You spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph before anyone else.`
` It's your victory without any complaints.`
`.........I won't accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new head of the Ushiromiya family and I will celebrate honestly.`
`"............Hmph."`
`As though dragged along by Battler's applause, Beato also clapped.`
`...It was a slightly odd scene.`
` Because Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing next to each other, applauding for the same person.`
`"I'm not applauding for a witch.`
` ...I'm applauding for all of Eva oba-san's efforts up until now."`
`"I am too.`
` I am honestly applauding as a blessing to Eva, who spectacularly solved that epitaph."`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...I don't like applauding with you. `
`...But, well, I've decided that I won't worry about it now.`
` ...Divine punishment won't fall on me just because I applaud with you every once in a while."`
`"Hmm.`
` It isn't bad once in a while. `
`......Still, it is fun to applaud.`
` Even though it was Eva who was successful and not me, for some reason, I'm starting to feel happy too."`
`"That's because blessing someone means the same thing as sympathizing and sharing with them."`
`"I see.`
` Then, I have even shared this irrational happy feeling with you.`
` ......Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other surrender, it is an odd experience."`
`"Well, ......just for now, let's have a truce and clap, alright?"`
`Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,`
` as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.`
` Battler went along with her, and clapped even louder.`
` When he did, as though some ceremony had ended, everyone applauded and highly praised the reborn Beatrice.`
` It was just as though Battler's and Beato's applause had been the final thing needed for her succession......`
