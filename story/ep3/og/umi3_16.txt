`The guesthouse lobby was wrapped in silence.`
` The strings of tension which bound Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened, they were completely tired, and their consciousness was beginning to waver.`
` Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, as though fighting their drowsiness.`
`".........Are you alright, Eva-san?`
` ...Please, do take it easy and rest."`
`"I told you, I'm fine......`
`...The three of us are now the only adults...`
` There's no time to rest...`
` No matter what the cost, we must guard this place until the end......`
`......Haah, ......haah......"`
`She spoke a brave line, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing.`
`...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a time, had returned.`
` It was very obvious that Eva's health was not good.`
`"Take it easy.`
` At least close your eyes.`
` Because if we have to wake you, we definitely will."`
`"I'm telling you that I'm fine...!`
` Leave me alone......!!"`
`"........................"`
`It seemed that she had already become obstinate.`
`......Krauss and Natsuhi realized that even if they talked to her any more when she was like this, it wouldn't reach her ears.`
` So without saying anything more, they decided to let her be.`
` To Eva right now, even an argument like that became a burden.`
` It would probably be better if she just sat there with her mouth closed.`
` Actually, Eva was already being beaten down by drowsiness.`
`...She might have talked back with a temper because she was trying to encourage herself and throw off her sleepiness.`
` The clock would be pointing to 6:00 in the afternoon very soon.`
` Because she had been snacking over and over again to fool her drowsiness, she didn't feel hungry, `
`but instead, her lack of sleep made it feel like it was 6:00 in the morning, not the afternoon.`
`......Even if they supposed that the boat came at precisely 9:00 in the morning tomorrow, `
`......there was still more than 12 full hours to go.`
`...That was an overwhelmingly long stretch of time.`
`............Long.`
`.........Painful......`
`......Hot...`
` Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.`
` In times like this, ......when that person puts his hand on my forehead, the fever fades at once.`
`...But that person no longer exists.........`
` As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...`
` She had already cried herself dry.`
` Even so, the sadness from losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...`
`"............I, `
`......made a mistake..."`
`"...Why?"`
`From the start, the new witch had been the same being as Eva.`
`...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...`
`"......If I could only gain the position of family head, ...that should have been enough.`
` ......But then, as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.`
` ............I was struck with a desire to have that mountain of gold all to myself......"`
`"That's nothing to be embarrassed about. `
`After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya family head.`
` How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"`
`"............I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.`
` ......While you are a young girl version of me, `
`......at the same time, you are also my self-centered evil heart.`
` ......You sprouted because of that mountain of gold, and because of my foolish greed,`
` ......the shell of that egg which is my heart split, ...and you were born into this world...`
`.........It's my responsibility that you were born......!"`
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria, `
`and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, that was your responsibility too."`
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?!`
` Why......?!!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"`
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi.`
` He was just so annoying and persistent.`
`...And that's our, no, your fault.`
` It's your fault for choosing a husband like that."`
`"A child like you cannot understand how good that person was!!`
` Oooooooooooooooohhhh..., dear........., oooooooooohhhh!"`
`".........Come on.`
` Our dreams were made real with magic, right?`
` We solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Then we found the gold and got the Head's Ring.`
` All of our dreams came fully true, right?`
` What more could you want...?"`
`"Just that wasn't all of my dreams...!!`
` Living a wonderful life with that person, and entrusting George with an excellent life...!`
` There are still many dreams that still haven't been granted for me, ...as a wife, as a mother...!!`
` And yet, ......and yet......!"`
`"...Those are just extra dreams you gained after becoming an adult.`
` They aren't my dreams."`
`"That's because you are a child...!!`
` As long as it's good for you, you're happy?!`
` ......That's right, everything is my fault...!!`
` Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?`
` Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I had found the gold...?`
` ......It's all because I'm ugly!!`
` My evil heart, which sprouted when I wanted to have all of the gold all to myself, ......caused you to hatch!!"`
`".........Looks like you really hate me.`
` Even though both of us are Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"No, that isn't true anymore.`
` And it was you who said it.`
` I am Ushiromiya Eva.`
` And you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!`
` So just disappear!`
` Witches are a delusion, an illusion that only exists in fairy tales...!!`
` Things like you should just disappear!`
` Never appear in front of me again!!"`
`"...Yeah, ......you're right.`
` ...I understand.`
` I'll disappear from in front of you. `
`...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.`
` From now on, I'm the Golden Witch Beatrice.`
` ...So now I can play however I want.`
` I don't even know you.`
` Why don't you just give up and die?!"`
`After having a very childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva hid herself.`
`......Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.`
` And she questioned herself...`
`"Me......?`
` I, ......killed them......?`
` Did I kill...that person......?`
` ......Did I, ......kill...him............?"`
`She could no longer answer that question herself......`
`"..., *cough*cough*cough*!! `
`*cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`It seemed that, half-asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.`
`...Eva suddenly started coughing.`
`"Are you alright, Eva? `
`...Please Natsuhi, some water."`
`"Y, yes..."`
`"I, ......I'm alright, okay...`
` *cough*cough*cough*! `
` *co-ugh*cough*!! `
`I just, ...choked a bit......!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!"`
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back, and unsteadily rose to her feet.`
`".........I'm going to wash my face.`
` ...Sorry, I fell asleep.`
` ......When I get back, I'll make some more coffee. `
`.........Extra strong, so that I don't get drowsy until tomorrow morning."`
`"Hmm, please.`
` ......Because the coffee you make fits my tastes more than the coffee Gohda makes."`
`"Even though you're flattering me, I'm pleased... `
`*cough*cough*! `
`.........I'll be back soon."`
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the lavatory.`
` Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...`
`"......So you do sometimes care for Eva-san, even though you have always been so much at odds with her."`
`"...............`
`...Fundamentally, isn't this what an older brother should do...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I believe that is correct."`
`"Not just Eva.`
` ......Rudolf, and Rosa too.`
` ...Instead of acting like an older brother to them, I have only ever spoken arrogantly and bullied them.`
`.........In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like my father.`
` ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...`
` However, that is no excuse.`
` ...I probably gave Eva scars so deep that they still have not healed.`
` ......I regret it, but if I apologized after all this time, that would not heal those wounds..."`
`".........If you hold on to that emotion, and not just for right now,`
` ...I'm sure that feeling will be transmitted to your siblings."`
`"......By now, my only sibling left is Eva."`
`"............If only, the family you and your siblings were born into had not been the Ushiromiya family......`
`......you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."`
`"...You mustn't say that...`
`.........Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.`
` And she has a right to. `
`...I intend to resign myself to that and accept it."`
`"..................Dear......"`
`"......Eva, `
`.........I am sorry.`
` ......Of course, you don't have to forgive me..."`
`Of course I won't forgive you. What are you talking about, after all this time?`
`"If you don't like it, why don't you just give up and die right now?! `
`Do it, Siesta Sisters!!"`

`Nihihihihi, Firing!"`
`Together, the sisters released the readied magic bowstring.`
` A beautiful tail trailed the gold arrow, and it drew a beautiful curve as it flew.`
` It was just like a gold snake.`
` It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.`
` Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.`
` The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.`
` Right before it was the door to the lobby.`
` When it flew into the key hole, Krauss and Natsuhi were already...`
` For an instant, Krauss thought he saw a gold-colored sparkle in the keyhole on the door.`
` However, at the same time he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked, `
`wrapping itself around Krauss's neck.`
`"............Ack, .........ah, uh,"`
`Just looking at it, the gold snake looked very supple.`
` However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck.`
` And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck.`
` Without even the chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.`
`"45, Hit and Kill Confirmed.`

`We got both of 'em nyeh, nihi!"`
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's bodies back.`
`......They slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the bodies, gradually increasing in speed, `
`and rapidly pulled them outside the guesthouse.`
` So the lobby was still, as though nothing had happened.`
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had not been there since the beginning.`
` Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as though feigning ignorance and pretending that they were the only ones there......`
`"......Sorry, I'm fine now.`
` ...Now, I'll go make some coffee."`
`Eva returned from the lavatory.`
` But no one was in the lobby.`
` Even though they had supposedly been in that sofa until the moment she had choked and gone to the lavatory, `
`they had gone, as if they had been an illusion from the beginning.`
`"...How careless...`
`......Where did those two go off together?"`
`Like she was pretending to be in a detective novel, Eva put her hand on the sofa.`
`......She felt a warmth which meant that they had been sitting there until a short while ago.`
` Maybe they had gone to do the rounds or something.`
` For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...`
` Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.`
` George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying...`
` His face was serious, and there was even sweat on his forehead.`
` However, Beato was the same.`
` Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.`
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.`
`"......Fine.`
` Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand.`
` ...Call to her with the voice of your heart, and seek her with the hand of your heart.`
` ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul."`
`"........................ha."`
`George kept praying earnestly and silently.`
` He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.`
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body, and searching for her as she wandered through hell.`
`......Beato turned that strong force into magical power, supplementing her own magic.`
` It was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help.`
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's help, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.`
`".........I have forgotten after several hundred years...`
`.........Was magic, `
`......was resurrection, `
`...always this difficult of a magic......?"`
`An even more strained expression rose to Beato's face than George's.`
`...It had slipped her mind, but originally, the magic to revive a life was the ultimate hidden art.`
` It was her previous magical power that could be used over and over with a snap of her fingers that was abnormal.`
` Therefore, the heavy burden to her body and mind was, fundamentally, extremely fitting...`
`"......However, .........this person's power, `
`...even though he doesn't know magic, it's nothing to be laughed at.`
` ......I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..."`
`The strong power pouring from George was large enough to act as magical power.`
`...At first, Beato thought it was due to the blood of the magician Kinzo.`
`......However, that was probably wrong.`
`...She had a feeling that Battler had taught her that.`
` It had been born from the power of George's sadness at the death of the person he loved, ......and from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life, `
`from the warm time spent together with Shannon, and the size of the dream they swore to protect in the future.`
` Are humans able to live this seriously during only one single life?`
`......Of course they could.`
` To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.`
` If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.`
` However, it was just like that broken vase.`
`......To humans in a world without magic, where they cannot return it to its original form,`
` ......it is very, very natural for them to bet their life and soul.`
`".........Is an Endless Witch, who can do as she wants even with life and death, `
`......inferior to a limited human who can't even surpass the mountain of death......?"`
`This time, the witch acknowledged it.`
` He was able to hold a magical power that could not reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life.`
`......Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
`...Even though I called myself the Endless Witch,`
` did I forget what the Endless Magic means for one thousand years.........? `
`She looked at George's expression again.`
`.........His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.`
`...Right now, even if George's body was burned or smashed by a waterfall, `
`he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.`
` For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.`
` So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical power in its perfect form......`
` The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
` Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`......But that just made me want to touch it.`
` But the vase easily fell and smashed into pieces.`
`...Like it was a bubble that had popped,`
` it felt as though the time when it had possessed a form was just an illusion.`
` Lives are that fragile, that easily, ......lost.`
` I realized that my foolish curiosity had caused something that couldn't be taken back.`
` No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
` The smashed vase wouldn't return back to its original form...`
` A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.`
` I was frightened that even though my careless actions had been thoughtless, `
`...they had stolen a life that would never be revived again.`
` Then, I pitied the lost life, and cried.`
` I was frightened of myself, who had made it become lost, and cried even more.`
` I'm sure that Grandfather also cried at the loss of his precious vase.`
` I'm sure that all of the people who valued Grandfather and saw him like that cried.`
` By just the loss of a single life, the whole world would be filled with so much sadness.`
`......I cried even more at how terrible that would be.`
` Beatrice appeared, and spoke.`
`"Then, Milady.`
` Let us revive that vase with magic.`
` If that will make everyone happy, the vase and the magic and the spirits`
` should be happy to lend you their power, and return it to its original form. `
`Come, Milady.`
` Close your eyes, and say the chant with me..."`
`"Come, try to close your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Those words of power forcefully knocked on the door to Hades.`
` Her previous magic forcefully knocked on the door to Hades in the same way.`
`......However, that way was horribly violent, ...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...`
` However, this time was different.`
`...It was very forceful, ...but it was very gentle and loving.`
` The dead near the door opened their eyes,`
` ......and called out to the other dead that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.`
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead, `
`and trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul...`
` And then, `
`.........they found it.`
` They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.`
` It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.`
`......Inside the casket that was covered with rose flowers frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...`
` The dead silently lifted that casket up.`
`...While at a glance, it looked like a funeral march, it had the complete opposite meaning.`
` It was solemn, but filled with joy.`
`...The long-forgotten dead were made to remember `
`that they were loved after their deaths,`
` ......and they were all given a warm sense of peace......`
` Then..., as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket...`
` The dead watched her go.`
`......They squinted at that warm light, `
`giving their respect to this unknown member of the living who had continued to hold onto his love for a person even after death...`
` Shannon's body was sucked into the light in the heavens and began to disappear...`
` In the jet-black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.`
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...`
`".....................ah!"`
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.`
` However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump into his throat.`
`......Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly.`
` Then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.`
` Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still wrapped in the fog of the land of the dead.`
` However, ......the human world's, ...no.`
`......The lover's warmth which had called her soul back slowly dissolved that fog,`
` .........and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.`
` Then, .........her eyes moved, ...and recognized George.`
`"......George......san............"`
`As her lips shook weakly, `
`......Shannon definitely said that.`
` The words were very faint.`
` So much so that they normally wouldn't have reached his ears.`
`......However, George clearly heard them.`
`.........He had heard the person of his thoughts, his fiancee, the one he loved most who should have been dead,`
` call his name once again...`
`"Shannon, `
`.........Shannon............, `
`do you, `
`......know who I am.........?"`
`"......George-sa...n......`
`............Is this, ......a dream.........?"`
`"No.`
` This isn't a dream.`
` ......C'mon, look, ......even if I pinch, you don't wake up."`
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek.`
`......It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.`
` When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek...`
`......And when George realized that the warmth of a living person had already returned to his beloved person's cheek...`
`......They both cried.`
`...What words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate with when they are reunited?`
`......The words of the human world are not enough to celebrate that.`
` In short, they had no need of the words of this world...`
` George simply hugged Shannon, who was sitting up, without talking.`
` Shannon's strength was still feeble, and putting her arms around George's back took all she had, `
`......so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.`
` To stop each other from going once more to a place the other's hand couldn't reach,`
` they hugged each other very tightly, and yet very gently......`
` On Shannon's fingers, which curled around George's back,`
` ......on her ring finger, the engagement ring George had given her definitely shone.`
` That strong sparkle definitely wasn't only the sparkle of diamond.`
`......There definitely was a magical power that only the two lovers could possibly feel.`
` It was because that strong light existed, ...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.`
` Beato understood.`
`......That ring, ......no.`
`............The feelings of the pair, embodied in that ring, were a miracle made real.`
` In that moment, George had definitely used magic.`
` Beato had done nothing more than help him along.`
` That magic had a magical power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life and trying their hardest.`
` It was the power of a miracle, which the Endless Witch could not know, ......and that only limited power could give rise to.`
` By now, she had no choice but to accept it.`
`......She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...`
`...exists in the place farthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.`
`".........Beatrice...sama......"`
`"......She brought you back to life... `
`Thank you, Beatrice...!"`
`"No.`
` I did not do anything. `
`......The thing that revived Shannon...was your magical power.`
` It was your magic.`
` ............The Ushiromiya blood, which succeeds in miracles, ...definitely saw you through."`
`".........George-san did, ......for me......?"`
`"...Hmm.`
` .........He had an incredible magical power, so much so that I could not reach up to his feet. `
`......So I still have not left the level of apprentice.`
` ...Now I finally know my place."`
`Beato staggered backwards.`
`...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.`
` She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.`
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single life, `
`which she had been able to play with however she wanted in the past.`
` The couple kept on embracing each other tightly.`
`...By doing that, their feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words, were communicated...`
`"Thank you, Beatrice.`
` ...We are in your debt..."`
`"...Thank you very much, Beatrice-sama.`
` ......I definitely will not forget that it was you who let me meet with George again."`
`"......Stop that, stop that.`
` Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as an extreme heretic. `
`......Don't worry, ...about me.`
` ...Celebrate your reunion together, .........as much as you can........."`
`Beato, who was leaning on her back against the wall, slid down with the wall still on her back, and sat.`
` How many centuries had it been since she had last grown this tired from using magic?`
`......I probably haven't been this tired since the time I first succeeded in magic.`
`.........Didn't Teacher praise me that time? `
`Oh, but didn't I kill that Teacher who praised me myself?`
`......Don't be naive, Beatrice.`
`...In the end, killing something isn't like that, right...?`
`"......Finally.`
` ...It seems you've remembered how to use magic."`
`"............My head...feels parched and suffocated, ......and I can't even remember...`
`...More importantly, ...didn't I kill you?`
` You shouldn't be appearing..."`
`"You have let me live until now.`
` That is why I can appear like this.`
` ......However, I did not come just to pat your head."`
`"......Did you come to sneer at how pathetic I am? `
`......And after all this time, ...if I have my head patted by a retired witch, the other witches will laugh at me......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Not only are you not a full adult, but you boast about avoiding your duty,`
` and the fact that you only learned how to use magic now is so embarrassing that you can't tell anybody."`
`"............That's right.`
` ......Keep it a secret, Teacheer..."`
`Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other with a sense of pleasant despondency.`
`"Love, is it. `
`............I'm no match..."`

` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake arrow fired by the Siestas, `
`weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden, `
`weaved its way through the hedge, `
`and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance, `
`aiming for the keyhole.`
` It weaved through the corridors, `
`and flew into the keyhole on the door to the parlor...!`
`"......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"`
`It had happened in an instant.`
`...It would have been difficult for Beato, who was completely worn out, to notice it beforehand.`
` Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake that flew in through the key hole...`
` surrounded the two lovers, `
`and pierced the two hearts in a blink of an eye.`
`......Furthermore, the gold snake faithfully pierced the hole in Shannon's chest once more...`
` The two hearts were pierced with the gold snake, `
`...no, with the gold sewing thread used by the new brutal witch's furniture,`
` .........and in an instant, so unfitting for the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...! `
`In front of Beato's shocked eyes, the two fell over and landed on the floor...`
`".........G, `
`......George......, `
`.........Shannon............"`
`"......Thank you, `
`...Beatrice......`
`...For letting us meet, `
`...even just for a short while, `
`......thank you........."`
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato, and died side by side with the one he loved.`
` The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.`
`.........It was searching for further prey in that room.`
` Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze...`
` In that instant, Beato was prepared to die.`
` At that time, Virgilia stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a mark.`
` In that instant, gold-colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.`
` It was like a blizzard of gold...`
`"Beato, escape while you can!! `
`No one can escape from the Siestas' golden bow!!!"`

`Prey that the Siesta Sisters' golden bow aimed at did not escape.`
` It could not be blocked.`
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.`
` The weak point during the instant of confusion caused by Virgilia's deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape.`
` And, it was the only chance to make the sisters confuse Virgilia for Beato.`
` As Virgilia spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through her heart...`
` The snake, which had snuck in through the keyhole, had shot through George and Shannon, and had then shot through Virgilia in an instant, `
`completely failed to notice as Beato escaped...`
` As soon as Virgilia saw that Beato had gotten away, she expired.`
`......The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...`
` Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,`
` became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside......`
`"...............Damn it, `
`.........damn it, damn it...`
`......You bitch, `
`......you biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...!!"`
`Beato felt regret from the bottom of her heart.`
` Why? `
`Because she had been attacked by the new witch? `
`Probably not.`
` Of course losing her teacher was also regrettable.`
` And even more, Beato was enraged at the barbarism which had boorishly stolen the union between the two reunited lovers.`
`......Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.`
`...Even though the result had been a miracle, `
`......it had been such a short time before that gift had been stolen...! `
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty which had ended it too fast.`
`......And it was also the true form of the actions she had committed up until that point...`
` So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she looked at her previous self with disgust.`
` But now she had to escape...`
`......If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.`
` It wasn't even funny that the chess player had descended like a god,`
` and had been attacked by the pieces.`
`"45, Impact Confirmed, Target Scattered.`
` ......W, without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor-sama...!"`
`"Our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger o-nce again nyeh.`
` Nihi!"`
`"What was that about loving couples?`
` You get to enjoy tearing the two apart by death, reuniting them, and then tearing them apart again, right? `
`*cackle*hihihihihihhihi! `
`Along with that, I feel great about getting to say goodbye to that damn fussy granny.`
` ......Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?"`
`"......I do not, `
`Beatrice-sama."`
`"That person interfered with the ceremony of the witch's epitaph, you see?`
` She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, and interfered with my ceremony.`
` No one has any right at all to complain.`
` Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!`
` But it sucks that she didn't leave a corpse behind.`
` ......And I thought I'd be able to torture that granny to death over and over again endlessly.`
` Kuhhihihyahyahya...!!"`
`"........................"`
`"G, George did...?!`
` He didn't show up, when did he go down?!"`
`"......Wh, when, you say...`
` What time was that, again...?"`
`"I think, ...it was probably around 4:00 or 5:00.`
` ...At the very least, it was more than an hour ago..."`
`"We got sleepy, and probably dozed off after that... `
`But I think it's probably like Jessica says.`
` About one or two hours ago."`
`"I, I also remember something from around that time.`
` Because I was asked whether I wanted more coffee..."`
`Something hard to believe had happened...`
` Apparently, when Eva oba-san had left for a second to wash her hands, `
`Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san had disappeared.`
` There's no way they went hiding somewhere.`
` Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.`
` Not one of them was broken.`
` And that wasn't just the first floor. The second floor was the same.`
` Again, all of the doors and windows possessed locks which had been designed so that they couldn't be set from the outside.`
`...In other words, there was no way that Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san had gone outside.`
`......And yet, they couldn't be found.`
` Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared. ......Even George-aniki had.`
` George-aniki had left saying that he was going to get more coffee, `
`and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.`
` We had been under the impression that he was having a conversation with Eva oba-san and the rest, `
`......but Eva oba-san, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.`
` Since all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside,`
` ...it was unthinkable that they had gone outside.`
`......However, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect closed room......`
` In a situation like this, we couldn't imagine that this was because they were playing hide-and-seek and trying to scare us with a prank.`
`......It was probably appropriate to think that they had been caught up in this crime...`
` When Eva oba-san had learned that her only son was missing,`
` she had gone half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name loudly.`
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, had chased after her.`
` Cries of 'George, George' and 'Mom, Dad' continued to echo through the guesthouse for some time...`
` I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's dead face.`
`......It would be reasonable to imagine that he had snuck out of the guesthouse and gone to the mansion.`
`...However, I don't know about Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san.`
`...Did they notice that, and go to the mansion to search for him...? `
`Without even telling Eva oba-san...? `
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start talking about leaving the guesthouse to search for them.`
`.........When that time comes, I'll agree.`
` Since shutting ourselves up inside the guesthouse should have been safe, `
`we should have been a big, happy family of 12 people and stayed shut in since this morning.`
` And yet, now there were only four people here.`
`......In other words, it means that being here is not safe...`
` However, ...before that, there was something that we must not forget.`
` That was the fact that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.`
`......This is a closed room.`
` How had they hid themselves away from this place? `
`We searched around thoroughly.`
` However, we couldn't find any traces of someone hiding.`
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.`
`".........I wonder how they did it...`
` You don't think, ......there might be something like a hidden door?"`
`"A hidden door...?"`
`"...The doors and the windows were constructed so that it is impossible for them to be locked from the outside.`
` Even using a fish line, it would probably be impossible with the way it is constructed. `
`In that case, it may be appropriate to think that they left through somewhere other than the door or a window..."`
`".........You're right.`
` That does make logical sense.`
` ......No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist.`
`...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."`
`"And, ...what would that be......?"`
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening the shutters, and checking outside,`
` and repeating this for each window.`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...This window sure is quiet. `
`...I see, unlike the other windows, the building was constructed so that the wind doesn't blow into this one."`
`"It appears that way...`
` It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...When I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......No, I did not notice it...`
` I believe it is well oiled."`
`"In other words, `
`it is possible to slink through a window in the hall when no one is looking.`
` Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window, `
`so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.`
` It'd be quiet."`
`Battler leaned forward and looked at the ground below.`
`...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.`
`......But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.`
`"......There might also be a window like this on the first floor.`
` It is possible to go outside without anyone noticing."`
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too are all locked, and the shutters are even down as well, correct...?`
` It is possible to go out, but closing them is impossible..."`
`"They can be closed, right?`
` Just like this, *click*"`
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.`
`"............B, ......Battler-san, you aren't saying..............."`
`"If someone inside locked it in the end, this closed room is as easy as pie."`
`"B, but that means, `
`.........that means, `
`......ooooooohhhh......"`
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.`
`...Because the thing that Battler said had hit him as a fact that was frightening even to imagine...`
`"......It's just a trick I thought of, right? `
`However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."`
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time, `
`only Nanjo, ...and Eva could have done it.`
`"I, ...I did not do anything of the sort...!`
` Y, yes, I can swear it...!!"`
`"......In this case, it becomes a battle between Eva oba-san and Doctor Nanjo for an alibi.`
` ...We just have to suspect both of you, `
`and confine the two of you separately.`
`.........To say it the other way around, the more survivors there are, the more effective this trick might be, `
`but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't effective at all."`
`...No, to the contrary, there would be a chance of having your own neck strangled.`
`......It should have been more expedient to make it look like the culprit was outside,`
` and to intentionally leave a door unlocked, or break a window...`
`"............If this disappearance theater had taken place midday today,`
` I'd have probably announced this theory with full confidence.`
` ...However, at this stage, I'm not confident at all.`
` ............What's going on here?`
` ...What in the world does it mean?`
` .........This 'closed room'......"`
`"Y, ......you don't think, umm........."`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Doctor Nanjo? `
`...Even if it's just a thought, please say it."`
`Because Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words, even though it seemed that he had thought of something, I urged him on.`
` After Doctor Nanjo refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.`
`"......No, umm,`
` ............you don't think this actually might be, `
`......the work of the witch...?"`
`"R, ...ridiculous. `
`There's no way witches exist."`
`"......The witch is trying to make her case to us.`
` ...And because she is doing things that humans cannot do, `
`...she must be trying to make us accept her as a witch.`
` ...To me, this disappearance from the closed room of this entire guesthouse, ......feels like that kind of message from the witch......`
`............I must not think of it.`
` Surely, it cannot mean anything.`
` ...Oooh, ......I, ...I am frightened......"`
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining one after the other.`
`......When we went down the stairs, Eva oba-san and Jessica were enraged, `
`and were each persistent in their desire to leave this place and search for their respective families.`
` It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.`
` Eva oba-san told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.`
`".........I've been shut up inside for a long time already.`
` ...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air."`
`"Sure, if you're going, let's go quickly...!!`
` There's no way I'm gonna keep myself shut up in a place like this any more...!!`
` Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii-san quickly...!!"`
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head.`
`...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma.`
`"Anyone who wants to stay can just stay.`
` Anyways, we're searching outside...!"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Will you watch the place by yourself...?"`
`"N, no...`
` Allow me to join you..."`
`Rather than holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed, `
`it would be better to be in a danger zone as a group of four people.`
` Eva oba-san was holding a gun.`
` Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.`
` In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.`
`......Even though it should have been safe to barricade ourselves here, we did that, ......and then lost eight people.`
` It was almost as though it was a holding room so that the sacrifices could be killed one after another.`
` We removed the chain, unlocked the front door and opened it.`
` It was already pitch black.`
` While there were some lights outside which dimly lit the pathway, `
`......they didn't have enough power to shine into the darkness that some suspicious person might be hiding in.`
`"I'm going...!`
` If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!"`
`Still holding her gun, Eva oba-san dashed out without an umbrella.`
` Jessica followed after her.`
` After looking at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.`
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island? `
`I've just been shut up in the guesthouse with the rest of the cousins since yesterday.`
` So I don't know anything about what's going on outside.`
` Just what is happening that I don't know about...`
` outside this room, in the mansion, on this island?`
`......Everything is happening, everything is proceeding, `
`...and everything is ending without my knowing it.`
` Somewhere in my heart, I have already begun to give up.`
`...Most likely, ......not one of us will see tomorrow morning.`
` When the seagulls cry, nobody will be left alive...`
