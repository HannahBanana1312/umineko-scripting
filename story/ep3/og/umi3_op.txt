`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
` Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
` Of course, that was a member of Grandfather's favorite collection.`
` So that I didn't make a mistake and destroy its fragile beauty,`
` I was always strictly ordered to never touch it.`
`......But that just made me want to touch it.`
` It was transparent and yet so elegant that just glancing at it gave it an indescribable sense of dignity.`
`...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that.`
` However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was something that shouldn't be touched.`
` Because something this beautiful shouldn't be touched.`
` It was a beauty that could only dwell in something that could break so easily.`
` Because of that, if someone like me touched it with their finger, it would happen quickly.`
` Just like how a fun dream disappears with a 'poof' when you wake up, `
`......it disappeared, fell, and broke into pieces.`
` I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
` No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
` The broken vase would not be returned to its original form...`
` I would probably be scolded by Grandfather.`
` Probably very harshly.`
` Frightened, I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing...`
` As I did, I noticed something, ............beautiful. `
` Lightly dancing golden butterflies, `
`were coming towards me.`
` As mysteriously glowing golden dots shone, the beautiful butterflies began to gather, one at a time.`
` Oh, it's Beatrice.`
` That reliable Golden Witch, Beatrice had arrived.`
` The butterflies gathered one after another and became a group. and there, became the witch's form...`
` She was always my ally.`
` Whenever I was in trouble, she would always appear and help me.`
`"Good day to you, princess."`
`"Beatrice!`
` ......Waaaah, hic, hic...!"`
`"Oh, my...`
` Why are you crying so on a day so perfect for a tea party, my princess...?"`
`"...I broke Grandfather's precious vase...`
` Waah, Grandfather will get mad at me.`
` ...I don't know what I should do...`
` Hic..."`
`"I see, that is worrying.`
` I believe the master really treasured this particular vase. `
`......Hohohoho, it's terrifying even for me, Beatrice, to think about what kind of punishment you'll receive."`
`Grandfather was a very frightening person.`
` And when you failed to follow something he said even once, he would become so mad, with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver.`
` Since I knew that so well that it pierced me to the bones, I couldn't do anything but shake like this and cry...`
`"I hold no magic to scoop up your fallen tears, princess, `
`but if you want magic that will make it possible for you to avoid being scolded by the Master, I might be able to do something."`
`"R, really...?"`
`"If you will believe in my power, princess.`
` The basis of magic power is the power of belief.`
` ......Miracles will only appear before those who strongly believe."`
`"I, ...I believe...`
` I believe in your power, Beatrice.`
` So please fix this vase.`
` Please...!"`
`"If that is what you want, princess.`
` ......Then leave it to me, Beatrice."`
`When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there, and changed its form into her favorite cane.`
` But even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at Beatrice's wonderful and great magic power.`
` She pointed her cane at the broken vase, and, just like a child's lullaby, she began speaking the magic words...`
`"Come, try to close your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Were they words, or was it a song? `
`No, it was surely magic.`
` After all, can't you see? ...The pieces of the vase are obviously gathering together,`
` and softly returning to the place where they had been displayed, ......returning to their original form.`
`"......Incredible..."`
`"See?`
` Now it's back to normal.`
` This way, you will be able to avoid being yelled at by the Master."`
`"Beatrice, you sure are incredible.`
` It was no trouble for you to repair a broken vase."`
`"That's not true.`
` Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing.`
` With my magic, I could do no more than make it remember what it was, for the time being."`
`"......?`
` But, the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?"`
`"That's right.`
` But that doesn't mean that the vase avoided its fate of being broken.`
` I did nothing but make the broken vase remember how it was before it broke for the time being.`
` Magic power that can repair a broken fate to its original form is at a very high level that I have yet to reach."`
`At that time, the high-pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion.`
` When I went to see what had happened,`
` ......I noticed that several of the servants had gathered, and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase.`
` From what they said, it seemed that a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere and had climbed up on the vase, causing it to break.`
` I understood the meaning of what Beatrice had said.`
`...At the time that I had broken the vase, 'the vase was broken'.`
` Beatrice had shown me that the vase had been restored, but that had been a temporary thing.`
` It didn't mean the fate that 'the vase was broken' had changed.`
` As a result, ......the vase had remembered its true fate, and 'had broken'.`
` But I hadn't broken it, instead, it had been a cat which had snuck in...`
` That's right.`
` Beatrice hadn't said 'Let's mend the vase'.`
` She had said she would make it so that I didn't have to be punished.`
` The fate of the vase breaking hadn't changed, but the fact that I had broken it certainly had...`
` Beatrice had skillfully saved me from danger with that magic...`
`"It is very easy to break something.`
` Just like how you, princess, broke the vase, but you didn't need magic to do it."`
`"...Fixing something is very hard...?"`
`"Yes.`
` So much that you were at a loss at what to do and started crying."`
`"......So it's easier to use magic to do horrible things?`
` To break, `
`......to kill is very easy, `
`......but fixing and reviving things is very hard, as you say..."`
`"......That's right.`
` With magic, it is much easier to do things like breaking and killing.`
` Therefore, weak witches lose to temptation and are intoxicated with gathering easy power to themselves, and neglect their real magic training. `
`......Real magic is the power to repair, to revive.`
` To call back happiness which has disappeared, to call back love which has gotten cold.`
` And it can call back a forgotten smile to a princess' face."`
`"Then, ......Beatrice, does that mean that since you could fix the vase, you are an incredible witch?"`
`"My days of training are far from over.`
` After all, I couldn't make the vase forget its fate for even an hour.`
` If it were my teacher, who taught me magic, `
`I'm sure that she would be able to restore the vase to its original form forever."`
`"If it broke and broke, she could fix it over and over again...?"`
`"Yes.`
` When one reaches that level they are considered to be an Endless Witch.`
` That is the endless level that all witches should reach.`
` We respect those witches the most and call them this."`
`"An Endless Witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......To witches holding the power to mend something endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn't even exist.`
` They are released from all of the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss."`
`Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss.`
` To escape that sadness, people pray to god, and ask for the power to withstand the sadness, believing it to be a test...`
` In other words, a human's life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness.`
` In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world.`
` ......In other words, it is eternal bliss...`
`"I wonder, ...if I could become a witch like Beatrice, and gain eternal happiness."`
`"You, princess...? `
`Hoh-hoh-ho..., that is a long, long, difficult path, you see?"`
`"I want to become a witch.`
` ......I want to be happy.`
` Beatrice, I want to become your disciple."`
`"...............`
` Do you have even the slightest doubt in that feeling?"`
`"No.`
` I also want to become a witch."`
`"......I understand.`
` Then, until you get tired of it, princess, I will allow you to be my disciple.`
` ...Will you call me Teacher?"`
`"Yes, Teacher."`
`"That's a good answer.`
` Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me.`
` I am also training.`
` Let us both learn magic the right way, and do our best to reach that blissful level."`
`"Yes, Teacher...!"`
`"..................`
`...Ah, a dream.`
` ......That face brings me back..."`
`An Endless Witch, was it? `
`A name that I had yearned for in the past as the highest achievement, and was now just another one of my titles.`
` No, you can even say it's my calling card.`
`"...Every once in a while, it's nice to feel satisfied by being called that.`
` Isn't it something that I gained as the result of many days of training? `
`...It's a little bit of a waste if I don't feel valued every once in a while.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`She shook her head lightly.`
` If it is called the highest level, that means that there is nothing higher.`
` An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom.`
`"Teacher said it once.`
` That when one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss. `
`......Which is why I think,`
`Teacher couldn't reach that level."`
`Eternal bliss means eternal boredom.`
`...That's the beginning of eternal torture.`
` But let's think about this.`
` Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn't run out of pages.`
` It means you can draw whatever you want, can try to have as much fun as you want.`
` Boredom is the worst poison that kills all witches.`
`......To the Great Witches who are given the title 'Lady', this is frighteningly true.`
` It is the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss that they have reached...`
`"Now that I have earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish to speak with Teacher again.`
` ......Was the result of our training really 'happiness'?`
` And now I want to talk with her about what true 'happiness' is."`
`'There is no end in training.`
` When you think you have reached the eternal level, that is the time to regret your immaturity.'`
`......I remember her saying something like that as though answering herself.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha... `
`I see, ......I am immature, am I?!`
` How nice, how nice.`
` *cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Some painfully shrill laughter could be heard.`
` It was from my furniture.`
` ...Did they break their toy again?`
`"Beatrice-sama.`
` This guy's stopped moving again."`
`"Even though I haven't played enough at all.`
` What a pathetic man."`
`"Even though I haven't played at all!`
` Let me play, let me pla-y!"`
`"Be silent, you filth! `
`Since you all devour him like starving dogs, no matter how well Beatrice-sama fixes him, he'll just break right away."`
`"Satan-nee broke him the most.`
` 'Cause she doesn't know restraint."`
`"My apologies, Beatrice-sama.`
` Please forgive my stupid younger sisters."`
`"Fix him quickly-!`
` I'm next, I'm ne-xt!"`
`"Couldn't you be silent, shut up!!"`
`"""""""Iiiee!!"""""""`
`Just from that single yell, the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes disappeared and hid.`
` They just mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him.`
` They only come to me to clean up afterwards.`
` ...Seriously, these furniture don't let me get bored.`
` What remained after the furniture hid themselves, ...was just the sloppy mess that was all that remained of the broken toy.`
` It had no form anymore.`
`"...It will be hard for me to make it remember its original form in this state.`
` It's better to make him remember for himself.`
` ......Oh, well."`
`I waved my golden pipe.`
` And I told.`
` I chanted.`
` I made it remember.`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ...After all, right now, all I can see is a huge lump of scrap meat. `
`I've no idea which part is the arm and which part is the leg.`
` If you don't remember, I won't even be able to remember your face.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`By the power of the magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been.`
` Which part should go with which part, `
`and where should join with where? `
`That's right, just like that.`
`...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand. `
`That's the right hand. `
`That's it, good, good, *cackle*.`
`"...Good morning.`
` Have you woken up, Ushiromiya Battler?`
` How truly ironic that being awake is even more like a nightmare."`
`".........*cough*, ...*cough*... `
`.........eck, ...owowow......"`
`"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you'll quickly awaken from this nightmare, and I'll send you to heaven.`
` I am the king of Mount Purgatory.`
` There's no way out of this hell without my approval."`
`"Heh, ...hehehehe.`
` You call this hell? That's just useless.`
` Aah, it's all useless."`
`"The pain of death, which humans only have to taste once,`
` has been given to you more times than I could count with all of my fingers, and yet, ...how can you keep talking like that?`
` *cackle*`
` That's why I don't get bored.`
` I don't get bored of you."`
`"Yeah, not bored at all.`
` Anyway, I get to pick and choose from those big boob Nee-chan's with dazzling asses in my harem.`
` Thanks to that, I'm not bored at all."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's great.`
` Otherwise I would be bored too. `
`So, my furniture.`
` I've fixed him, so you can play as much as you want."`
`"Thank you very much!`
` Kyaha, all mine!"`
`"Didn't I say you're done, you're done, I'm next! `
`Back off, waaah!"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` Wonderful, isn't it Battler-ku-n?`
` You're so popular, aren't you?"`
`"It's hard being a popular guy.`
` Get in line, you beasts."`
`"If you didn't bluff and stayed obedient, this would be much easier."`
`"It's alright like this.`
` His screams are more pleasant this way."`
`"Alright, let's not break him easily this time.`
` Come on, your answer?!"`
`"You aren't in control! `
`So, Battler-kun.`
` Let's continue where we left off, alright?`
` After they locked Jessica-chan's room with the master key, how did they return the key to the corpse's pocket, which was inside the room?"`
`"......For example...`
`...that's it, they used a fishing line or something, and just the key went back into the room through the crack of the door..."`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Wro-ng!"`
`"So naive. `
`{p:1:Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip."`
`"Wrong, wrong?!`
` Right, this time me, my turn!`
` Whe-re should I strike!"`
`"Me, back of the hand!"`
` `
`"That's me-an!`
` Then, the back of the opposite hand!"`
` `
`"I'll take the tip of the nose!"`
` `
`"Why, why, let me do it too, let me strike too!`
` Waaah!!"`
`"Levia-nee sure is slow, we've always done first one wins, right?!`
` Then, I'll take the top of his foot!"`
` `
`"Waaah!!`
` Me too, me too-!`
` I'll take his shoulder, alright!"`
` `
`"Keh...`
` You're sisters right? Be nice to each other...`
`...Gwaaa, ......oh, .........hh..."`
`"......How can you withstand that?`
` Why haven't you realized that your false courage actually makes us more excited?"`
`"Sorry, but...`
` false courage and being stubborn are my specialty.`
` No matter how you all try to speak in riddles, I definitely won't accept witches and magic...!"`
`"Even though you can't explain anything with human tricks?`
` Are you a moron?! `
`Know your place!"`
`"It's alright, we don't have to force him to accept it.`
` Right now he wants to accept it, crying. `
`Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!"`
`"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!"`
`"Aa-h, he's broken already!`
` Beatrice-sama!"`
`"......Ah, well.`
` Since they know that I can revive him over and over, my furniture don't even hesitate to break him.`
` How troublesome."`
`Giving eternal rebirth and eternal death at will.`
` Before the Endless Witch Beatrice, all death and life has no meaning.`
` Even death can't become the key to escape from my cage.`
`"So, Battler.`
` Remember your original form again.`
` I'll toy with you as much as I want, you see? `
`I see, I see, it's truly pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity.`
` ......I see, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level? `
`I see, I see.`
` This is surely a pleasant bliss.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I'll revive you over and over, kill you over and over!`
` Let's see, what kind of murder play will unfold on the next game board?`
` Come, bring the new game board. Why don't we begin the next game, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
