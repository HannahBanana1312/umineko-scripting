`"Hahahaha, wahahahaha!`
` I never thought that Lady Bernkastel's piece would barge in at the very end...!"`
`"......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.`
` ......I was sure that you'd like it."`
`"What's with that piece?!`
` Who was that person, who was it?!`
` She didn't say her name! That's mean!!`
` Hey, don't you think so too?!"`
`"...I have a general idea.`
` ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."`
`"Normally?!`
` I don't get it, it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?!`
` If she doesn't say her name, I won't, the players won't, everyone won't understand, right?!"`
`"............Beato, it's alright if you don't tell her.`
` Right?`
` Isn't she a funny kid?"`
`"H, ...hmm. `
`......Lady Lambdadelta's naivete truly is precious and funny.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Why, why, why won't you tell only me, you meanie!!`
` Then in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know!`
` So tell me!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` A special secret, you say?!`
` I want to hear, I want to hear...!"`
`"Bleah!`
` If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that girl really was!`
` The secret I know sure is awesome!`
` After all, it's about as awesome as knowing that Santa-san is actually daddy!`
` Huh?`
` *giggle*!`
` I said itâ˜† Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that it turned your world upside-down, right?!`
` Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!"`
`".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"`
`"He came...wait, what do you me-an?"`
`"...Lord Santa Claus only visits the homes of children with clean hearts.`
` He didn't come to your place, did he?"`
`"Well, Lord Santa Claus is gracious.`
` Unless you are a re-ally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present.`
` After all, he even gave them to me!"`
`".........As you grow and your heart is hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he?`
` How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"`
`"Hmm.`
` He stopped coming when I was about 12.`
` My maiden's heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord Santa coming.`
` After I wrote 'Thanks for everything, that's enough.`
` So make sure you splurge on the last presents', he stopped coming.`
` Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!`
` How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady Bernkastel?"`
`".........I was pretty wild.`
` ...It happened fairly early.`
` I think when I was about 9.`
` ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, trying to cut it off.`
` ............What a painful age."`
`"So, ......as long as she can remember, Lord Santa Claus has never come to see Lady Lambdadelta, is it?`
` ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."`
`"...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her.`
` I hear that being too precocious can have a bad influence on the growth of mind and body.`
` ...Yeah, there's definitely some of those.`
` ...Bad influences."`
`"Hey, wh, what are you guys talking about!!`
` Bleeeeah!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"`
`"......If you're talking about that level of secret, it looks like it isn't worth listening to.`
` Can I go now?`
` I have to prepare for the next game."`
`"Wha, hey, wait a sec!`
` Tell me who that woman really was!!"`
`"......Well then, tell me this special secret first.`
` If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!!`
` Alright, I'll tell you, 'cause it really is a special secret!`
` ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Just what kind of secret could that person have?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!`
` I noticed who that girl actually is.`
` Does anyone know?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` There was a hint in the way she talked.`
` Remember, that girl said it a lot, right?`
` 'Why don't you somethi~ng?',`
` right?!`
` Yes, that phrase is the main point!`
` {c:86EF9C:Ebaa~}?`
` Ebaa~?`
` Yes! `
`She was actually, Ushiromiya Eva!!`
` What do you think?!`
` Are you shocked?!`
` Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!!"`
`"Hoh...!`
` I didn't notice that! `
`...Muu, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."`
`"......Nice job playing along with her, Beato.`
` This kid's getting arrogant, so calm her down.`
` See you, I'm leaving."`
`"Wait, wait!`
` It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!!`
` Tell me who she really was!!"`
`"......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn't match up.`
` ...So in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret.`
` I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'."`
`"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, don't say it!!`
` I'm still playing i-t!!"`
`"......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahha...`
` See you, Beato.`
` The black tea was delicious.`
` However, the repertoire of jam on the crackers was lacking.`
` Add some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.`
` It goes great with Russian tea.`
` Later."`
`"Oh, I see.`
` I shall try it.`
` I shall call for some after preparing for the next game.`
` Until then, feel free to polish up your strategy at your leisure."`
`"Yes, I'll do that.`
` This last game was pretty interesting.`
` Later."`
`"He-y, wait a sec, tell me-!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` My, my, you two really are close."`
`"........................`
`......Yes, that's right.`
` ...Oh, I really like you, Bernkastel.`
` You could even say I love you.`
` ......I want to gouge out your eyes so that you can see no one other than me.`
` ......Oh, that would be truly wonderful.`
` It'd be wonderful to dunk them in black tea.`
` Aha!"`
`"To think that you would be so entranced, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ......I have a serious responsibility.`
` Still, this last game really was close!`
` I was a breath away from getting Battler."`
`"............Beato.`
` Can I ask you something?"`
`"What is it?`
` I won't tell you that girl's name.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...When'll you stop fooling around? `
`...Do you even feel like winning?"`
`Lambdadelta threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of Bernkastel.`
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.`
`".........You know, `
`I'm supporting you because you're supposed to be a witch who can win against Bernkastel.`
` If you don't have the power to win against her, `
`then I'll abandon you at any time, alright......?"`
`"............How harsh of you.`
` What about me dissatisfies you?`
` ...As you know, my Lady, my game board is perfect.`
` Lady Bernkastel will never be able to win..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Your board truly is impressive.`
` It truly is an impressive and perfect game board that Bernkastel definitely cannot win in even after spending one hundred years, `
`or even one thousand years.`
`......That's why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch.`
` .........If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a human.`
` ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` ...I am grateful to you..."`
`"Don't speak so casually.`
` I'll forgive that when Bernkastel's around, but I won't when she isn't.`
` Recently, maybe you've forgotten your debt to me."`
`"Th, that is, .........n, ...no, ......not so......"`
`"...Aah, you're as disgusting as I thought.`
` You can talk the same way as usual.`
` But be mindful of what you say.`
` ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"`
`"H, ......hmm......"`
`"Let's return to what we were discussing.`
` ...Your game board truly is perfect.`
` ......You should be able to defeat Bernkastel without any trouble.`
` ...But that kid won't surrender easily.`
` She'll challenge you over and over."`
`"That is no problem.`
` ...It has been certified by you, Lady Lambdadelta.`
` ......My game board is perfect."`
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect. `
`............But are you, the player, perfect as well?"`
`".........What do you mean by that...?"`
`"What do I mean?`
` That's what I want to hear.`
` .........You play a lot in your game.`
` ...At first, I thought you were speaking in riddles for Bernkastel's sake every now and then, as part of your tactics.`
`............But I get the feeling that's not quite true.`
` Rather than toying with the opponent in a match you can win, `
`......actually, you don't care whether you win or lose, right?"`
`"R, ......ridiculous...`
` How could that be..."`
`"You know what?`
` Your role is to make Bernkastel surrender.`
` In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.`
` ......As long as you keep trying to become the 'certain' victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.`
` ............However.`
` If you fight in a way that doesn't deny any possibility of your loss,`
` ...that's a different story."`
`"Of course, this is a game...`
` In the same way that Lady Bernkastel will lose if I win,`
` ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win.`
` The possibility of loss always exists.`
` Therefore, I will-"`
`"..................This is why you're useless.`
` There's no need for this to be a game board for you.`
` It's alright if this is a bird cage to lock Bernkastel up here for all eternity.`
`...What's the role of a bird cage?`
` Making sure the little bird inside certainly never escapes.`
` ......What's a bird cage worth if it has cracks that sometimes let a bird out?"`
`".........O, of course, games exist for winning.`
` So it is impossible for me to lose.`
` ...Therefore, I will continue to win......`
`...As you wish, for all eternity..."`
`"Good answer, that's alright.`
` ......I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.`
` It was sometimes useful in this last game.`
`............But you know?`
` If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,`
` ............at that time, prepare yourself wonderfully, okay?"`
`"I, I will not do such a thing...`
` I swear it...!"`
`"............Because originally, you weren't even a witch, and at any time, `
`I'll remind you what a truly shabby creature you were.`
` ............If you betray my expectations.`
` At that time, you can look forward to a fun, fun punishment game.`
`...In the world of billions of Fragments, ......I'll send you into the most miserable Fragment and seal you there.`
` .........You were miserable in the first place, so it'll be worth choosing a really miserable Fragment. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"........................"`
`"Oh, I love you Bernkastel.`
` ...Scrabble your feet in Beatrice's bird cage as much as you like,`
` and learn that you can no longer escape after one thousand years.`
`......And when you surrender,`
` ...I'll train you so that you can't do anything other than cry in the palm of my hand.`
`.........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
