`There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.`
` It wasn't a refreshing morning.`
` All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...`
`"......It's hard to imagine that it's morning.`
` This horrible weather reflects our hearts."`
`"Then isn't that pretty gentle?`
` At least falling rain is better than falling spears."`
`"Wahhaha.`
` Whether it's rain or spears, it's comin' down with a bang. `
`.........Is it already 6:00?`
` Fuaaaaaa...`
` Isn't this enough?`
` After this, we've got no measures we can take until the mystery 19th person, Beatrice, takes action."`
`"That is correct.`
` ......However, I believe we have thought of every trick they could use against us."`
`"That's right.`
` As long as a traitor doesn't appear amid the siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."`
`"......Haven't we talked about this enough?`
` We've stayed up all night.`
` ...I'm tired."`
`"You're right.`
` How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"`
`"...A good plan.`
` Staying up all night is trying at our age."`
`As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.`
`"I'll go wash my face or something.`
` We probably look horrible."`
`"...............?`
` What is that horrible stench?"`
`As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie openly made a disgusted expression.`
`"...What happened?"`
`"Hey, don't you smell something awful...?"`
`".........Hm.`
` ...What is this stench?`
` I can't stand it..."`
`Because of that disturbance, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.`
`...It was a faint stench, but after Kyrie had started complaining about the stink, they clearly noticed it.`
` Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...`
`"What in the world could it be?`
` Let us have Genji deal with it.`
` I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."`
`"Hmm, please.`
` It is at least difficult to imagine `
`that Gohda would make a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."`
`Rudolf and the others searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground,`
` from the boiler room.`
` But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside.`
` On the other side of things, as Natsuhi and the rest were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, they noticed something strange about the parlor.`
`"......What is this...?!"`
`"I, it's a horrible prank...`
` Who would do something like..."`
`On the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange...,`
` thing like a magic circle drawn.`
`"No one has come to the kitchen yet. `
`......Wh, what is, that?"`
`Eva's group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen, `
`had returned after checking that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.`
`......And they had noticed something unusual about the parlor.`
`"It's useless, the boiler room is locked.`
` Wouldn't it be bad if something's broken down in the boiler room?`
` Is there a servant anywhere around here?"`
`".........!`
` Is that vulgar scribble here too?`
` There was also one on the door to the boiler room."`
`"What's that?!`
` This creepy scribble isn't just here, but it's in other places as well?! `
`Haha, you don't think that this is the witch of the forest Beatrice's declaration of war, right?"`
`Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch.`
`...The dripping bright-red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more creepy.`
` Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it had been locked.`
`...As a general rule, the parlor wasn't locked.`
` Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.`
`"......What does this mean...?`
` Could it be that, while we were talking in the dining hall, someone secretly left this scribble?`
` On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"`
`"...I'm sure the servants are behind this.`
` We were together the whole time.`
` We all have alibis.`
` ......They probably received some strange order from Father, and did this prank."`
`".........Including the case yesterday with Maria-chan's letter.`
` It is very easy to suspect that the servants are acting on Father's orders and planning something. `
`......Anyway, where is everyone?`
` They can't be playing hide and seek.`
` Let's look for them."`
`"B, ...before that, I'm worried about the children.`
` They're alright, aren't they?`
` I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there."`
`"Then let's split up.`
` While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll investigate inside the mansion.`
`.........I don't want to think about it, `
`but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just where we've found them."`
`"......We might be wrapped up in Father's bizarre game.`
` ...I will go to him and hear the situation. `
`......Well, I don't think he will obediently listen to me though."`
`The adults split up.`
` As a result, they made sure that four children were safe in what they were calling the cousins room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.`
` It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing.`
` All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.`
` Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright.`
` It seemed he believed in the phrase 'early to bed, early to rise', and had awoken refreshed.`
` During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.`
` But they didn't find them.`
`...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.`
`"......The children are alright.`
` All of them stayed up too late last night."`
`"The servant room is empty.`
` I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift begins at 6:00.`
` They should have started workin' by now..."`
`"The nap room is also empty.`
` There were signs that a futon had been taken out, but it wasn't warm."`
`"Hey, ...isn't your reasonin' right on this?`
` ......This is probably a game planned on Father's orders.`
` Surely, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,`
` trying to make us do somethin'."`
`"......Are you saying that he's trying to see who is fit to succeed his wealth and inheritance?`
` ...Isn't that a bit..."`
`"No...`
`...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."`
`"After all, Father loves big tricks.`
` ......This might have been a polished plan since that epitaph was hung in the hall."`
`"...In that case, I wonder whether they will make an announcement of the game or an explanation for it.`
` ......Although it would be nice if an envelope with the crest, like the one handed to Maria-chan, were to appear."`
`"............That's right.`
` Maybe Nii-san and the rest have found that in the mansion."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` Have you heard anythin'?"`
`"......M, my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on. `
`And yet, ......yes, I see,`
` I could easily imagine that Kinzo-san is planning something big."`
`"...Shouldn't we go back to the mansion for now?`
` Maybe they found somethin' over there."`
`"If I will not be in the way, I will go too."`
`"I, I'll stay here.`
` ...The children are sleeping upstairs.`
` We don't know what is happening.`
` We cannot leave them alone."`
`"......That's right.`
` I'll stay with Rosa-san and watch over the place.`
` Would you tell that to my husband?"`
`Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.`
` Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion.`
` On the other side, in the mansion...`
` In a way that was hard to believe, ...or maybe we should say in a way that gave him a bad feeling...`
` Rudolf's prediction was right on.`
`...Because the same magic circle scribble that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple places throughout the mansion.`
`"Aniki...!`
` How's Father?"`
`"No, it was useless.`
` There was no response.`
` I tried putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone."`
`"...I cannot find the servants anywhere.`
` ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."`
`"This isn't funny.`
` Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.`
` ......What in the world is happening...?!"`
`There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.`
` There were two on the second floor, `
`and one on the third floor, for a total of five.`
` They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn't check inside.`
`"...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first.`
` It would be bad if something broke down and caught fire or exploded.`
` ...So we need the key."`
`"It should be in the key box in the servant room."`
`They fished through the key box in the servant room.`
` Because each of the servants carried their master keys around, those weren't kept here.`
` However, all of the individual keys should have been kept here.`
`"............It's so packed with keys."`
`"...It isn't here.`
` No matter how much we look, we won't find the key to the boiler room."`
`"Look, Aneki.`
` ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them, `
`aren't here at all."`
`"......It's true.`
` ...How troublesome......"`
`"It's as though someone didn't want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles. `
`......No, they went to all the trouble of making those magic circles obvious, so they wanted us to enter...?"`
`"I think it's the latter.`
` ...This isn't a movie, so breaking down the door is probably impossible.`
` It might work if we smash a window."`
`Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.`
` At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.`
` There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.`
` They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.`
`"Good morning.`
` ...I heard that something strange has happened."`
`"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."`
`"What is it?`
` Did you find a letter or somethin'?`
` I was sure you would have found somethin' like that by now..."`
`"......You're right.`
` I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father's... `
`But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that.`
` Like the letter that was given to Maria-chan."`
`"What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria-chan's letter?`
` The details of the game, 'try solving the riddle of the epitaph', have already been shown."`
`"Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean?`
` ...And the missing servants."`
`"......Natsuhi nee-san.`
` How many servants were there total today...?"`
`"Huh? `
`.........Genji, Gohda, `
`......five of them, but why?"`
`"......So, there are five servants.`
` There are also five magic circles.`
` ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."`
`"...Nii-san.`
` Let's break a window.`
` We should check and see what's inside."`
`"............We have no choice.`
` Do it neatly."`
`Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window.`
` And he decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.`
` They had hoped to peek in through the window, `
`but the curtains were down, so they couldn't see inside.`
` Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the window.`
` Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back.`
`"You don't have to smash the whole thing.`
` Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."`
`"Don't get your hopes up, alright?"`
`Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times.`
` Eventually, he succeeded in opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.`
`...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it.`
`"We should probably cover it with packing tape later.`
` The rain'll get blown in."`
`When he suddenly opened the window, the wind and rain made the curtain dance around violently.`
` The curtain was blown to the side.`
`...They could see the parlor they knew well.`
` They were a little relieved.`
`......Because they had thought that maybe, there would be another bizarre magic circle inside the room,`
` or possibly the traces of some creepy ceremony.`
` In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain,`
` so six people: Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo, entered the parlor as a group.`
`"......It seems, ...that nothing in particular has changed..."`
`".........Mu-"`
`"Wh, what has happened, Shannon...?!"`
`"Wait, wait, are you alright?!`
` What happened to you?!"`
`"Blood, blood!!`
` D, D, Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"`
`"Hey, Shannon-chan!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Answer me!"`
`"Y, you mustn't shake her...`
` I will examine her condition now..."`
`She had been in the shadow of the sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they had entered the room.`
` Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright-red with blood......`
`"He~~y,`
` Battleeer, where are yoooou? `
`Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, see~~~?`
` I won't bully you anymore, so come out.`
`......Hmmmm?`
` Oh, there you are.`
` What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"`
`"........................"`
`Battler was crouching under the table, holding his head...`
` His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything...`
` Had he heard Beatrice's sneering voice?`
`...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear? `
`In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell...`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
`......I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady.`
` After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument,`
` I can understand why he wants to mope around."`
`"Hey, Battleer.`
` If you can't argue back, resign, alright? `
`It's your turn.`
` If you don't make some move or pass,`
` or else give up, we won't get anywhere."`
`"........................et."`
`"......Huh?`
` What's that?`
` I can't hear you?"`
`"I said be quiet!! `
`Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!!`
` A witch? Magic?!`
` Can't you just do what you want, I don't believe, I don't believe any of it, `
`damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!! `
`Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, disappear, disappear, just disappear!!`
` Don't get that annoying face near meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"..................!"`
`Without thinking, Beatrice winced at Battler's sudden rage.`
`"......E, even if you say that...`
` If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come.`
` I'm trying to say that I don't want you to bore me but..."`
`"Who cares, be quiet, shut uuup!! `
`Who cares about your game,`
` I won't go along with iiiiit!!`
` If your turn won't come until mine is finished, then just wait for all eternity!!`
` Aaaah, I don't know I don't know I don't get it!!`
` I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that screwed up!!`
` Uuooooooooooohhh, I said don't talk to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`......I don't know what's what anymore.`
` After being shown something that screwed up, how could I resist...`
` I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.`
`......It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet.`
`...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.`
`"...............Maybe, `
`...I lost to that person's game a long time ago."`
`...Actually, in the last game, I wonder whether we hadn't reached a clear resolution.`
` After all, I had surrendered for a time.`
` So the world had been tinted with witches and magic.`
`......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic.`
`...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it.`
` Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.`
` I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender.`
` Just now, a terrible battle had unfolded in this rose garden.`
` I had seen it with my own eyes.`
` I kicked the ground.`
` ......Obviously, the ground was hard.`
` And a puddle splashed.`
` Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high-rise buildings.`
`......The more I kicked this ground, `
`.........the more it felt like that really couldn't be possible.`
` But, because of that, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore......`
`"......A closed room with the key shut up inside. That one again.`
` I know that that's often used to prolong detective novels.`
`......But, ......still...`
` That big flashy thing.......`
` Damn it........."`
`"............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."`
`"...Huh?`
` .........It's you..."`
`I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around, `
`...and in the rose garden arbor, `
`......was the Predecessor Beatrice, who Beatrice had supposedly defeated a short while ago.`
`".........I was sure you'd died.`
` So, you were alive."`
`"No, I died.`
` ...Now, I am nothing more than a defeated chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."`
`"You're Beato's teacher, right?`
` So, in other words, you're a witch too."`
`"......Yes, that is correct."`
`"Heh.`
` So, in other words,`
` ......that means witches really do exist?`
` And I'm not the one who can defeat her.`
` That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn't it?`
` ...I'm just useless now.`
` There's nothing I can do anymore..."`
`"............Oh, my.`
` Have you surrendered completely?"`
`"What do you mean, surrender?!`
` How should I explain that?!`
` Towers sprouting and falling!!`
` Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears! `
`Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel weird, now even reasoning's useless, isn't it?!! `
`We've left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahh, damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board.`
` After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything. `
`But you are that child's opponent.`
` Because as long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."`
`"Shut up!`
` Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!! `
`What do you mean, strike back?!`
` Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, and make me take part in that massive magic battle?!!"`
`"......If you wish,`
` I could teach you a bit about magic."`
`"Oh, just what I wanted!`
` Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!!`
` Hah, don't screw with me!"`
`"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain.`
` Do you know of it?"`
`"Rain ceremony?`
` That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance?`
` ......That's not magic.`
` They say that the fire causes an updraft, and as a result, rain clouds gather.`
` That's supposed to be an accepted scientific phenomenon."`
`"Oh?`
` ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic,`
` but it isn't magic?`
` I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,`
` so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."`
`"Maybe people did that long ago.`
` But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."`
`"Why do things burn?`
` Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"`
`"......No, things burn because of a chemical reaction.`
` Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."`
`"Why does heat transfer through objects?`
` Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?"`
`"...I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.`
` Heat is energy, not a substance."`
`"You have studied well.`
` Your knowledge is correct."`
`"...It's just some random facts."`
`"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and god's love.`
` ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation. `
`In the past, I was told that an apple falling from a tree `
`was thanks to god's love, so that humans would be given food."`
`"The love of god instead of gravity?`
` ...Well, that's probably the remnants from the period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."`
`"That is correct.`
` In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge, `
`......no, ignorance itself, magic.`
` ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about.`
` Did the people of ancient times realize that there was a scientific explanation, `
`that fire gave rise to heat to cause updrafts which called clouds?`
` Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."`
`"......That probably happened a lot.`
` That thing called knowledge of the ancestors.`
` Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would achieve a result.`
` ...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them."`
`Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn't understand the principles had probably believed that, `
`through the rain ceremony, their wish would reach the heavens and make rain fall.`
` To them, that was certainly magic.`
` As long as they didn't understand updrafts...`
`"If you push an electrical switch, a light turns on.`
` ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why a lightbulb lights up,`
` they only know the result when they push the switch.`
` If they obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn't that magic to them?"`
`"............That's pretty interesting.`
` ...Well, logically, that's true.`
` ...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture.`
` However, I think it's completely normal to see things shown on a TV.`
` Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that 'if I push the switch I can watch TV'.`
` ...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding updrafts.`
` ......In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as magic,`
` no, could you say it is magic?"`
`"Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed?`
` Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"`
`"......Nope.`
` I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue.`
` I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."`
`"That book was a fake.`
` Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes, `
`and they do their job with magic."`
`"Huh?!`
` That's stupid, there's no way...!"`
`"How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"`
`"......I've never looked inside, but I can state that small people like that definitely don't exist!"`
`"Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."`
`"Y, yeah, it is impossible to prove right now,`
` ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"`
`"So, in other words,`
` my 'magic theory', that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic,`
` is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, right?"`
`".........Erk, `
`.........what the hell, one of those?`
` Are you trying to say it's a 'Devil's Proof'?`
` That's your favorite trick, you witches."`
`"A 'Devil's Proof' is a form of underhanded sophistry formed by claiming that it is impossible to prove a negative fact.`
` However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes.`
` That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."`
`"......You're right.`
` It really isn't a 'Devil's Proof'."`
`"The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose.`
` ...One of those is the truth.`
` And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube.`
` However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories.`
` So while there is only one truth,`
` until you look into the Braun tube, you can make two conflicting truths exist at the same time.`
` ......A different universe where, in a case that only one truth must exist, two can exist at the same time."`
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead? `
`If you open the box, you will know the answer.`
` You will know the truth.`
` However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead.`
` Each of the two parties make a claim that is the 'correct' truth,`
` and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.`
` In other words, two truths exist at the same time.`
` Even though there can only be one cat in the box,`
` it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world.`
` That is what Rokkenjima is now.`
`......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.`
`...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself, `
`at a glance, it may feel as though this island had been sucked into a world of magic.`
` While that may be correct, it is not accurate.`
` Strictly speaking, it has been moved from the world of science to the gap between that world and the world of magic.`
` So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side.`
`......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds.`
`"......I don't really get it...`
` The gap between reality and magic?`
` A perfectly impartial world? `
`How's that?`
` Hasn't everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"`
`"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.`
` This is a trial.`
` Think of it as a court where you and Beatrice are laying out opposing claims.`
` It's like a Braun tube trial.`
` That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes.`
` And she explains one thing after another, `
`talking about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like, what type of magical power they have.`
` ......And you?"`
`"......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed."`
`"At that moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time.`
` ......If you listen to that child's claim, `
`you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth.`
` You truly were shown that."`
`"........................"`
`"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth.`
` ...However, until the moment that the cat's box is opened, that world is an uncertain wave function.`
` The entire situation can be explained by both sides at the same time.`
` However, there is one truth.`
` That truth is contracted by observation,`
` and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.`
` It is like when, in court,`
` the judge makes his judgement.`
` The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims,`
` are contracted by the judgement, and become one."`
`".........To say it in your words, `
`......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...?`
` Therefore, the science theory and the magic theory cannot be denied.`
` And since they cannot be denied, "`
`"Both can exist as truth.`
` Therefore, both witches and magic can exist.`
` ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies that also exists as truth.`
`.........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time.`
` And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.`
` .........Have you been able to understand...?"`
`"..................In other words, `
`......no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me, `
`...that is only a claim from the 'magic theory', and it doesn't disprove mine.`
` So, 'no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me,`
` in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists'."`
`"That's right.`
` That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic.`
` That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic,`
` and claim that she dropped it to the earth.`
` However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims.`
` None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim.`
` ......In that sense, this world is quite 'impartial' to both sides."`
`".........I, get it...`
`......Still.`
` By that argument, if I show a sound argument with my 'science theory',`
` and it collides head on with her 'magic theory', I also cannot win against her.`
` Furthermore, the final judgement won't come until we peek into the Braun tube.`
`.........Where is the Braun tube in this world?`
` ...It means there's no reason for us to argue.`
` ......Wouldn't it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube? `
`If there really is a tiny person in there, it's my complete loss.`
` Otherwise, it's my victory.`
` ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"`
`"That itself is the 'game' which that child has challenged you to.`
` Maybe, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.`
` Victory and loss is not determined by a judge.`
` You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."`
`"......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"`
`"In actuality, did you lose the argument, and surrender like this...?"`
`"...............Heh.`
` ...Heheheh."`
`"That is all the advice I can give you now.`
` If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."`
`"......Sure.`
` Thanks, that really helps.`
` ......I'll avenge you."`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho, thank you.`
` I am looking forward to it."`
`"What's your name?"`
`"...Beatrice used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name. `
`.........So, I shall take a temporary name.`
` ......Virgilius.`
` ...No, `
`what about Virgilia?"`
`"Virgilia.`
` {c:86EF9C:Valkyria}?`
` Wasn't that the name of a legendary goddess?"`
`"No.`
` It means the one who is a guide to Beatrice.`
` ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of the Mount Purgatory.`
` It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."`
`"To think that I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches.`
` ......I see. `
`If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works.`
` ...Ihihi, it's almost funny."`
`"I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix.`
` ......Your will to fight has already been revived.`
` ...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child,`
` ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at.`
` ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."`
`"Yeah, watch it.`
` ............I won't listen to her babbling anymore.`
` I'll cooly fight to the end.`
` I definitely won't get provoked by her anymore."`
`"Then let us return.`
` To the seat of the battle."`
`"...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...!`
` Where did you hide yourself?`
` *cackle*!`
` I thought the sore loser wouldn't show himself again, you see?"`
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've cooled my head a little."`
`"And?`
` Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Teacher and meeeeeeee?`
` Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy? `
`Hihhyahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah?!"`
`"...Milady.`
` Didn't you just promise to be kind and act refined?"`
`"Ahhyahahahahaha, oh no, oh no.`
` I just got in such a good mood when I saw Battler's face, you see?`
` Look look look, so Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it?`
` Hmmmmmm?"`
`".........................`
`...Battle?`
` Did something happen?"`
`"......Whaat?"`
`"Where in this rose garden?`
` Where did those spears`
` and towers that you grew fall to? `
`............Nowhere, right?`
` ......In other words, it's just like the insides of a Braun tube."`
`"......The insides of a Braun tube, you say??`
` *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"`
`"In this very moment,`
` there is nothing at all in the rose garden.`
` Towers may have sprouted with magic until a short while ago.`
` However, that's just because we don't know what's inside the Braun tube.`
` ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that's nothing more than a claim.`
` Right here, right now, there is nothing at all to prove that.`
` This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now.`
` Right now, there isn't anything here, which proves that nothing happened...!"`
`"..................`
`......Hahaha, hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!`
` You know, obviously I can't make a huge mess when it's only the second twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see?`
` To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier.`
` So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality."`
`"......That is your claim?`
` Well, I guess that works.`
` However!`
` At this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden.`
` So my claim that there was no magic hasn't been blocked!!"`
`"W, wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?!`
` It is impossible to prove that magic 'does not exist'!`
` It's a 'Devil's Proof'!!"`
`"At this point in time, this garden is the truth!`
` The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.`
` And there are no traces of magic here at all!`
` So that battle between you witches 'did not take place'!!"`
`"Wh, `
`......what the, `
`th, that counter......?!`
` That power, `
`...c, could it be...?!"`
`"...Have you forgotten, Milady?`
` It is the Multi-layered Worlds Contraction Technique.`
` The power of a finite witch in contrast with the power of an Endless Witch.`
` Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."`
`"Sch, 'Schrodinger's cat box'?! `
`.........Th, ......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled-for hint!!"`
`"We've lost time.`
` With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!`
` Let me check the scene.`
` I've been trudging along wasting time.`
` From now on, I'll speed things up, okay? `
`Take a seat, Beatrice!! `
`It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing.`
` Show me what you've got!!!"`
