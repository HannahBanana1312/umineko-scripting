`The true enemy of a siege isn't the fear of unseen enemies.`
` It's probably about whether you can keep that going over a long period of time.`
` Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV.`
` Since there was no TV in the lobby, we decided to return to the cousins' room on the second floor.`
` They probably expected that we wouldn't want to leave Maria all alone.`
` The adults told all the children to go to the second floor cousins' room.`
` George, whose heart was wounded by the loss of the person he was engaged to, led the cousins up to the second floor without any resistance.`
` At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby,`
` but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something sinister, `
`he said 'it seems I am in the way' and returned to his room on the second floor.`
`"............I'm starving.`
` If we just sit around, we'll get even sleepier."`
`"It's only natural.`
` Because we didn't sleep last night."`
`"...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours.`
` It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over-stressing ourselves."`
`"That's right.`
` My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."`
`"Our opponent might be expecting that, right?`
` While they couldn't defeat this many people, if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use it to their advantage."`
`"There are seven of us here.`
` We could take three hour shifts in pairs.`
` ......It's a long time until tomorrow.`
` We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough."`
`"Sure will.`
` Anyone sleepy?`
` Don't overdo it, and rest."`
`Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.`
`...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.`
`......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.`
`"......Nobody?`
` Well, don't overdo it, everyone."`
`"If we get tired, then we can think about it.`
` ......I certainly am tired, but I'm not in the mood now."`
`As Eva spoke sharply, she reminded everyone of the second letter from Beatrice, which had been found in the boiler room.`
` Beatrice had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up her assets and the inheritance if it could be solved...`
` Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.`
`"............Is that the epitaph?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Although it's annoying to do as the culprit says.`
` After all, we do have time to waste.`
` I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom."`
`"...Not a bad way to kill time.`
` Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?"`
`"......Can I borrow that?`
` I'll rewrite it just a little larger. `
`Natsuhi-san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"`
`"There should be paper in the servant room.`
` I will bring some."`
`Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.`
` Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.`
` Then, everyone quickly peered down at it.`
`...They automatically crowded around.`
`"I've heard about it, but...`
`...really, this is a tough riddle.`
` I don't have a clue what it's talking about."`
`"At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."`
`"If you did know, you wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.`
` After all, it's 10 tons of gold."`
`"............This is the first time I've read it seriously, but...`
`...roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?"`
`"...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really are a good thinker, Kyrie-san.`
` It's possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn't."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kyrie's sharp.`
` ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way without any strange preconceptions."`
`".........That's right.`
` Kyrie-san.`
` Will you openly tell us about your thoughts after reading the epitaph?"`
`"I think it probably won't be very useful to all of you.`
` You all give me too much credit."`
`"No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful.`
` Let us hear what you have to say. `
`......Because your hints always help me when I'm worried."`
`"Oh, so they were helpful?`
` It's nice to finally hear about this now."`
`"Come ooon, don't I always thank you?"`
`"You two sure are close.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints.`
` It's alright, we're just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"`
`Kyrie was disturbed at being praised for something so strange.`
`...But they had plenty of time.`
` She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role...`
`"......I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but...`
` well, I'll put forward my ideas."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, speaking roughly, it could be divided into three parts?"`
`Well, ...I just mean what I said.`
` I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts.`
` First, there are the five lines up until 'There sleeps the key to the gold'.`
` Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key.`
` And then there's the part formed by the 11 lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the Golden Land itself.`
` And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached.`
`"I see.`
` It can be divided into three parts about the key, the Golden Land, `
`and the Golden Land's treasure."`
`"Even we have been able to grasp that much.`
` The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."`
`"...Nii-san, don't butt in any more than you have to!`
` Let Kyrie-san speak her ideas freely."`
`"Kyrie.`
` Please continue.`
` ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said.`
` So then?"`
`"......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the 'beloved hometown', means.`
` Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather's hometown?`
` Since he went to all the trouble of telling us that it's beloved, I can imagine that it's a hometown he thought about very deeply.`
` ......Didn't Father come from Odawara?"`
`"............Odawara is definitely where he was born, `
`but I don't think this hometown Father loved was Odawara.`
` I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."`
`"...Right.`
` This probably isn't Odawara.`
` From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` ...Father's greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"......Probably.`
` Father really hadn't wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"So where is it?`
` And is there a river where sweetfish swim?"`
`"......Maybe they were there at the time.`
` By now, there has been a lot of development there, and the sweetfish might have disappeared.`
` It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."`
`"There is no single river, right?`
` I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense. `
`......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, right Eva?"`
`"That was only as a vacation.`
` ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father's time.`
` After all, it was caught up in the war, wasn't it?`
` It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived.`
` ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location, `
`by now, even he wouldn't be able to determine where it was that he lived."`
`"Because that place has had a remarkable revival..."`
`"............After hearing about a sweetfish river, does any place name come clearly to mind?"`
`"Well, I wonder.`
` After all, they're sweetfish, right?`
` People say they live in rivers with clean water, so there are countless rivers we could guess at.`
` Any stream that Father innocently went sweetfish-fishing in was probably buried by the development later.`
` It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."`
`"......It probably isn't something like that."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`".........My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key.`
` ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line.`
` ...Something is being presented with just these two lines.`
` What if the next three lines continue based upon that something?"`
`"What do you mean, something is being presented...?"`
`"......I don't know.`
` Anyway, these two lines aren't vague about the river, like they don't know which river it is.`
` It clearly specifies this 'river'.`
`......It may be that this isn't a 'river' with water flowing down it.`
` ...The 'sweetfish river' might be some kind of metaphor.`
` ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"`
`".........Sweetfish are like salmon.`
` They're freshwater fish, but they go out into the ocean right after they're born.`
` And when they get big, they return to the river to live there, `
`and then they spawn there and end their lives there. `
`Well, they leave their home at one point, but when they get big and return to lay eggs,`
` that might have a family prosperity type of image."`
`"Hmm.`
` They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the ocean?`
` I didn't know that.`
` I thought they were river fish, so they couldn't go out into the sea."`
`"And they are called sweetfish because they have a pleasant aroma.`
` I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when grilled with salt."`
`"Whoa, Natsuhi-san!`
` You've never eaten salt-grilled sweetfish?!`
` They're delicious!`
` You should try it sometime soon!"`
`"It is a food for commoners.`
` It isn't appropriate for your mouth."`
`"......This is just my wild idea, `
`...but the image I get from a sweetfish river makes me suspect a family tree.`
` The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?`
` .........It makes me think about myself."`
`"You're right.`
` By this point,`
` I can confess that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria-chan."`
`"I see.`
` ......If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village.`
` If you go down the family tree looking for a village, all you find is Maria's name [{p:0:真里亞}], which has a '{p:0:里}' [village] character in it."`
`"Isn't that right?!`
` ......But as you all know, Father doesn't like Maria, `
`and he has almost never spoken with her. `
`And, in the past, Father told me to give Maria a completely different name.`
` I just changed it to Maria on my own.`
` Father was very mad about that.`
` ......If you think about the details there, `
`it's very hard to imagine that he would reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would succeed his wealth and inheritance."`
`"Have you ever let Maria-chan read the epitaph?"`
`"Uh, yes, of course.`
` But it looked as though she didn't have a clue.`
` ......She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a resurrection ceremony for the witch."`
`"............A connection between Father and Maria.`
` ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.`
` ...I can't imagine it refers to Maria either."`
`"......What worries me is the fact that he went to all the trouble of adding the word beloved at the beginning.`
` ......Like you all said just now, `
`if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head, `
`would he yearn for that?`
` ...I don't think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya head family.`
`......I believe that this word 'beloved' here at the beginning `
`refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."`
`"............Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Well, that's fine.`
` It would be hard to pinpoint since we don't have a clue about a map from that time,`
` but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Father's hometown during his youth."`
`"That's if it's a river with water flowing down it, right? `
`And then?`
` Go on, Kyrie-san."`
`"......I don't really understand the three lines starting with 'If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village'.`
` ...That is probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river.`
` It's probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.`
` ...As long as we don't understand that, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."`
`"So we give up unless we know what the 'sweetfish river' really is...`
` And there's no guarantee that it even means a literal river. `
`...Seriously.`
` What does it mean, sweetfish?`
` Did Father like to eat them?`
` Or is there some special meaning?`
` Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"`
`"...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.`
` ......It might be better if you don't think too deeply and be flexible, `
`holding an abstract image of a river where fish swim, or something flowing, `
`...up or down."`
`"And the answer for the 'sweetfish river' passes through the next three lines and makes its way to the 'key to the Golden Land'..."`
`"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.`
` There's actually four parts.`
` ......'Go down the sweetfish river', `
`'find the key to the Golden Land', `
`'journey to the Golden Land', `
`'and the treasure of the Golden Land'."`
`"Hmmm......`
`...Truly interesting.`
` Good work. After that, would you tell us your opinion about the most central portion of the epitaph, `
`getting to the Golden Land, up until the tenth twilight?"`
`"......That's the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."`
`"Since it keeps mentioning the word sacrifices, `
`I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult ceremonies...`
`.........How do you see it, Kyrie-san?"`
`Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,`
` peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...`
`"..................`
`.........This is...very difficult.`
` ...By starting with 'He who lays hand upon the key', `
`it probably means that you won't be able to continue without understanding the key.`
` ...I'll have to give up, but I'll take a shot at trying to solve it anyway."`
`"......Just like how the 'sweetfish river' isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it, `
`it is also doubtful that this 'key' is actually something shaped like a key."`
`"Right.`
` There's also the possibility that it's a code or a keyword.`
` ......After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole.`
` It's something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight.`
` In that sense, we can state that this key isn't something to open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"......But it is a disturbing key. `
`A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."`
`"How would a key select anything?`
` ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"`
`"This key points towards a certain group of six people.`
` ......No, we should say it points to a certain group of six things,`
` ......if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.`
` For example, it could be an anagram."`
`"An anagram?`
` Do you mean playing with letters...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I've kept thinking about it since Rosa started talking about the family tree,`
` and about how village was a part of Maria-chan's name.`
`......It seems as though Rudolf-san, for example, has assumed that this has been talking about something related to geography or coordinates since the words 'beloved hometown',`
` but that might not be true.`
` This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` What is playing with letters?"`
`"Oh yeah, it's like 'sucker merry barrels'.`
` Wha-t do you get when you take out the e's and r's? `
`Like that.`
` Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi-san, so you probably don't know."`
`"...Merry?? Take out the e's and r's, huh?`
` ???"`
`"Stop it.`
` It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."`
`Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face.`
` It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified, `
`after hearing Rudolf and Eva's sniggers.`
`"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee-san, it's something like this.`
` This is just something from Maria's book of riddles, okay?`
` There's this thing called the Tanuki Notebook.`
` It's a notebook written like a code, with a lot of 'ta's mixed in,`
` and if you 'remove' all of the 'ta's, then the true paragraph pops up.`
` It's a game like that."`
`"Ah, ......oh, I see.`
` .........??"`
`Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.`
`"............So maybe that 'remove' part is actually represented by 'kill'...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I also thought that.`
` It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with six characters."`
`"In other words, ...the 'ta' from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?`
` Hmmm, ...this is getting complicated..."`
`"Playing with letters, is it...`
`......hmmm.`
` In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it seems that it a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in English speaking circles.`
` ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."`
`"......But by this point, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.`
` Until this part, while it did flow like a riddle, it was extremely sequential.`
`'Sweetfish river', 'go down it', 'then find the key', is all extremely sequential.`
` And as a result, we can guess that we gain a six character key,`
` ......but in that case, we now don't know 'what' we kill the six characters from."`
`"That's right.`
` Where do we pull the six characters from?`
` It doesn't tell us."`
`"...At the second twilight, there are 'those who remain'.`
` ......Which means that, at the very least, that 'something' has a limited number of characters.`
` You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the six characters are removed.`
`.........And yet, we don't know what this 'something' is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning.`
` ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"`
`"..................Hmmmmm..."`
`Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.`
` It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn't been able to before..., but they stumbled just one step before it.`
` At that time, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily.`
` The silence up until then was broken by laughter.`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` Strangely enough, by spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty.`
` Looks like I can't stand missin' breakfast..., wahahahahaha."`
`"Natsuhi.`
` Isn't there anything here?"`
`"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.`
` I will prepare it."`
`"I'm also starving.`
` I'll bet those brats above us are starving too.`
` ...But I doubt that there's enough for 18 people here, and for three meals, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` It'll be a long journey until tomorrow.`
` It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."`
`"There's nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them.`
` But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."`
`"That will be fine for now.`
` Would you prepare it for us?"`
`It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.`
` The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation team split up for the time being.`
` But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...`
`"............Playing around with letters was nothing more than my theory.`
` There is a chance that it's mistaken.`
` Eva-san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` This is something I've decided to do.`
` Would you mind leaving me alone?"`
`Eva spoke coldly.`
`...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.`
`"Nee-san.`
` Shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?"`
`"Then you go help.`
` I'm busy solving this!"`
`"S, sorry...`
` Th, then I'll help..."`
`".........Come on.`
` Why are you like that?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.`
` It seems as though you've given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you, `
`but if you could solve it, there's a chance even you could receive the inheritance.`
`"......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii-san.`
` Why aren't you seriously trying to solve it it for that once-in-a-lifetime chance?"`
`"...Um, .........umm, ......I......"`
`Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer.`
`...Too late, she regretted that she had carelessly spoken to her sister when she was in a bad mood.`
`"If you've noticed anything, say so.`
` Even though Kyrie-san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you?`
` Come on.`
` Isn't there anything you've noticed?`
` Come on!"`
`"............Uh, `
`.........umm, `
`.........`
`......Isn't, ...this strange?"`
`"...Strange?`
` What is?"`
`"Umm, ......this word, Golden Land.`
` The word Golden Land comes up several times."`
`"So what?`
` Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in 'Golden Land'?"`
`"Um, umm, that's not it.`
` ......Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?"`
`"............Huh?`
` ......ah."`
`"Even though they're all written the 'Golden Land' ({p:0:黄金郷}), for some reason, only this place has the 'village of gold' {c:86EF9C:({p:0:黄金の郷})}.`
` He went to all the trouble of mixing in the character '{p:0:の}'.`
` It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here... `
`.........ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything.`
` This is Father we're talking about.`
` It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."`
`"........................"`
`".........Boring."`
`"Oh, what is boring...?"`
`".........Boring, boring."`
`"My, my.`
` I don't have a clue what this child is grumbling about."`
`"She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler-sama various hints, Madam."`
`"......No-t really.`
` That's not unsatisfying.`
` I'm actually more satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho...`
` Were you a little too friendly with Battler-kun?`
` Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku..."`
`When Virgilia and Ronove giggled and cackled, `
`Beatrice's irritation meter finally reached its limit.`
`"Heeey, you're all laughing at me! `
`Ronove, hide yourself for a while!`
` Disappear, disappe-ar!"`
`"Certainly.`
` Then, I will rest for a while. `
`Pu kukukuku..."`
`Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself.`
` After that, all that remained was the figure of Beatrice, who was grumpy and irritated, `
`and Virgilia, who was cooly enjoying her tea.`
`"............When you said '{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}', you actually cornered yourself."`
`".........I thought so...`
`.........I thought it might have been a little too early, but...`
`......was it really too early after all......?"`
`"If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different,`
` but it really was a futile trump card.`
` You stirred him up instead."`
`In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch, `
`Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting someone of the 18.`
` Hadn't he been weakest when he had been tossed about by two opposing goals? `
`However, Beatrice had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people.`
`...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18, `
`.........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that.`
` Battler was stubborn, `
`but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china.`
` That itself should have been his greatest weak point, but...`
`".........Kuuuuuu.`
` ......Did I get a little too careless after my complete victory last time......?"`
`"Yes, you were too careless.`
` ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler-kun, `
`but it seems that this game will become `
`a difficult one for you."`
`"......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form.`
` ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces.`
`.........However, now that Battler has been instigated this much, how should I plot against him...?"`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho.`
` Your troubled face is an even better snack than Ronove's cookies."`
`"......Uu-.`
` You and Battler and even Ronove are making fun of me.`
` ...Even though I'm not naive at a-ll."`
`With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler, `
`Beatrice rolled her head around on top of the table.`
`"............Teacheeer.`
` .........At least a hi-nt."`
`"Oh.`
` What kind of hint?"`
`"If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him accept me, `
`I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm, `
`...even if it's just a hint."`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho, I can't.`
` I am acting as Battler-kun's ally, `
`so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."`
`"...You don't have to say it so stiffly...`
` Even though your disciple's in trouble..."`
`"I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your teacher, correct?"`
`".........Uu-...`
` Please act like an old person and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom...`
` Pleease...`
` It's mean if you only help Battleeer..."`
`"My, my.`
` You're still a spoiled child.`
`......But, it's true that I may have given Battler-kun a few too many hints.`
` It did serve as a scolding to you, `
`but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."`
`"Isn't that right, isn't that right...?`
` Please, Teacheeer, at least just a hint now..."`
`"...............This is just a hint.`
` Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"`
`"Yeah, yeah! `
`I'll think about it myself, so please!`
` Please, give me one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps."`
`It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn't around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him.`
` Virgilia took a deep breath at how Beato was still a child no matter how much time passed.`
`"Then just a hint.`
` ......Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"`
`"Of course.`
` It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` Violent or impatient methods aren't always necessarily the best decisions."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that.`
` I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."`
`"............`
` Think well about what this means.`
` And furthermore,`
` ......it seems Battler-kun had a slight misunderstanding, but it also seems that you are misunderstanding something.`
` Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"`
`"...What else is there, other than making Battler surrender?"`
`".........See?`
` At that point, you are already mistaken."`
`"How am I mistaken?"`
`"Your victory isn't making Battler-kun surrender.`
` ......Isn't it making Battler-kun accept your existence?"`
`"......What's this?`
` You want me to butter up Battler, asking 'Accept me as a witch, pleease?'!`
` How foolish!`
` I will not sink so low!"`
`Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled like a dog in a bad mood.`
` Virgilia shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short-tempered as always...`
`"That is my hint.`
` Now you should think deeply.`
` .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler-kun.`
` A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."`
`"...I'd understand even without you telling me.`
` ......I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun, `
`but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my objective.`
` ......I'll introduce a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Teacher...!"`
`"Hoh-ho-ho...`
` I look forward to it.`
` I wonder how Battler-kun will tackle that.`
` ......I am wishing you good luck as well."`
`"And Battler too, right?`
` Hmm..."`
`".........Are you going to give up and resign already?`
` If you're that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep...?"`
`...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,`
` 'I' scolded myself.`
`"......You also dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss, right...? `
`Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you're already throwing it away...?"`
`You could say that, but...`
`............This riddle is really difficult.`
` Even a wire puzzle would be better.`
`...At least in that case, you are assured that it definitely is solvable.`
` But I don't know if there's any assurance whether this riddle of the epitaph is solvable.`
`......I might just be fighting a useless battle.`
`...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time.`
` It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had looked at so many nights that I might have burned a hole through it.`
`......That, is truly a door.`
` On the other side, there is the 'Golden Land', which I had wished I could drag myself to since I was a child no matter what the effort,`
` ...and which I hadn't been able to drag myself to.`
` Am I touching the door with both hands,`
` ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, can I still not reach the other side?`
`"...That's right.`
` You have already touched the door with your hands.`
` Come, open it with all of your strength.`
` And read the characters written on the door."`
`".........Open it, `
`with all my strength.`
` ...Read, `
`the characters written on the door..."`
`Strain your eyes.`
`......See through to the thing beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...`
`"...The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations.`
` ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."`
`That's right......`
` Then what about the 'sweetfish river'? `
`There are several rivers where they swim, but it is suspicious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived.`
`...If we start wondering whether there was a nearby river on a map where sweetfish lived..., `
`things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to get specific...`
`"Didn't you say it yourself?`
` You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it.`
` ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...? `
`Think of a river.`
` A river.`
` Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.`
` Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"`
`......Not a river?`
` Even though the sweetfish can't swim in it if it isn't a river? `
`Oh, but maybe if sweetfish could swim, that means it's tied to the ocean......`
` Didn't my husband even say that, while they are river fish, they can go out into the ocean...`
`.........`
`....................................`
`............To the ocean.`
`.....................No, `
`...but, `
`...............Huh...?`
`"......Did you notice?`
` But that's just a faint memory.`
` There should be a book archive somewhere around here.`
` If you investigate, you can make sure."`
`......If that was the 'sweetfish river', .........`
`.........And if the key might be a six character word...`
`..................Was the key really resting in that river? `
`I, I don't know, I don't know.`
`...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...`
` But, even if I know that, I don't know 'from what' I should take the six characters...`
`"......You really don't know?`
` Think deeply.`
` .........We're pretty smart, so our ideas are solid.`
` Don't think of it like it's something as massive as the riddle of the epitaph, but like it's a child's riddle.`
` ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get.`
` Even if Father has advanced into old age, `
`that doesn't change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart.`
`.........Throw away your awe of Father.`
` ...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile game with riddles, like the one Maria suddenly brought up on the boat."`
`......Riddles.`
` ......Worthless, infantile.`
`........................`
`..................Huh, .........ah.`
`.......I'm sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......`
`...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ......that's probably, umm...`
` No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory.`
` I should be able to figure that out immediately by searching in an archive.`
`".........We've probably already noticed the answer.`
` ...All that's left is to research whether that's correct or not.`
` Come, Eva.`
` Let's go to the archive and make sure no one notices.`
` ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study.`
` ...I'm sure that we'll find a book that answers our question.`
` .........Quickly.`
` This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."`
`When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` It looks like I woke you."`
`"......Eva.`
` If you're sleepy, don't overdo it.`
` You rest first."`
`"Th, ......thank you.`
` I'm just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."`
`"You should take it easy and rest.`
` ...Is your body troubling you again?"`
`"I said I'm really fine! `
`I'll be right back."`
`After leaving only those words behind, I rapidly left the lobby.`
` The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.`
`......The archive was next to the servant room.`
` Father always owned a vast book collection,`
` but ever since he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, that collection grew even larger,`
` so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.`
` This archive was where those normal books were stored.`
` They were all thick, like complete encyclopedias for intellectuals,`
` but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something.`
` I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.`
` Then I locked it from the inside.`
` I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.`
`...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.`
` My heart had started jumping......`
`...I had been half-asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn't been able to realize how significant this thing I had noticed was.`
` But as I had become aware, ......my heart had started to feel like it was about to explode.`
`".........I, ...wonder if any of the other siblings have noticed this......"`
`I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will notice.`
`......But I don't know about Kyrie.`
` She has extraordinarily good intuition.`
`.........And I don't know about Rosa either.`
`"Rosa is also stupid.`
` She always has been, and surprisingly so."`
`Really...?`
` I think she was wise enough to make you think she was stupid, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice.`
`".........Here it is.`
` ...I wonder if we'll find it in this one."`
`I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......`
`"............Uu.`
` .........This is, `
`.........`
` a 'sweetfish river'...?"`
`I see...`
` This is what the sweetfish river means.`
`......Don't dawdle around, research further.`
`"Y, yes, I understand...`
` If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village...`
` By village, does it mean a town or something?`
` That's an area of dense population, so there could be many of those..."`
`Why have you stopped thinking?! `
`If you don't like it, why not quit...? `
`Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie?!`
`"I, ...I don't want to...`
` I will become the head.`
` ...This is, umm, my first and last chance...`
`......What is '{p:0:里}' (village)?`
` What does it mean?!`
` If you go down the 'river', there's a {p:0:里}......?!`
` ............ah, .........`
` aaaaaaaahhh......!!"`
`......In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of.`
`......It's 'shore' ({p:0:岸}).`
` Understand?`
`"Uu, ...*gulp*...`
` I, I, I understand...!`
` 'Shore', ......'shore'.........!"`
`Right before my eyes, ......the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all, `
`......began to *snap*, `
`......*snap*, `
`into place, all by themselves......`
` I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth.`
`...My throat grew completely dry...`
` Is it, ......really alright for this to be the answer? `
`R, really?`
` Really...?!`
`"...But this isn't six characters at all.`
` ...I'm absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"`
`Did you stop thinking again?`
` In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.`
` If you can't think of one, then research it.`
`......There has to be an answer.`
` You must not doubt that.`
` If you can't believe that, why don't you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die...?`
`"............1, `
`2, `
`3, `
`4, `
`5, `
`6...`
`......Oooh, `
`...s, `
`......`
` six characters...`
`"`
`......I, `
`......I found it.`
` ...This, `
`.........is, `
`th, `
`......the key to the Golden Land.........!!"`
`Yes.`
` This is, the key to the Golden Land.`
` ......The key, to our childhood dreams.`
`......The only keyhole to stick that key in, is that place.`
` That, is definitely what offers the sacrifices.`
` Now, do you understand............?`
`"Whaa, ..........whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
