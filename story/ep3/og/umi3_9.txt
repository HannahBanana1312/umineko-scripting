`......Forget what the adults expected.`
` At least for us kids, `
`these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where the cousins deepened their friendship.`
` However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us...`
`"............hic, ......hic......!"`
`"........................"`
`George-aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun's deaths.`
`......Right now, everyone who was alive was gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
` And there were 12 of us.`
`...Unbelievable, right? `
`There were 18 until yesterday.`
`...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives...`
` I eventually sobered up from my agitation, and, along with my lack of sleep because of what had happened so early in the morning, `
`I was beginning to feel like this was a little unreal.`
`......I want to think this is some kind of bad dream...`
` My cheap escapism keeps telling me that over and over.`
` Maria had gone back to sleep in the sofa Rosa was sitting in.`
`...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn't had enough sleep.`
` The adults were grasping members of Grandfather's collection,`
` short-barrel Winchester rifles.`
`...Apparently a remnant from a western-obsessed time, there were four guns altogether.`
` Those had been split up between the four siblings: Krauss oji-san, Eva oba-san, my dad, and Rosa oba-san.`
` Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading them.`
`".........It's a little scary.`
` Even now, if I touched one of these, `
`I get the feeling that Father would yell 'Don't touch that!' and hit me."`
`"Well, isn't that great.`
` ...No matter how much you touch them, you won't be hit again."`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` ...That Father...`
`.........would meet this kind of end..."`
`"I did think that when it came to Kinzo-san, he would probably not die normally in his bed, `
`......but even so, ......it is too horrible..."`
`"Hey.`
` I wonder if that really is Father...?`
` I think it might be a different person's corpse as a substitute to trick us..."`
`"......No, without a doubt, that is Father.`
` You saw his toes, right?`
` In general society, there aren't many humans with six toes on both feet."`
`"But, ............we can't say that there are none.`
` I've heard that polydactyly isn't a rare disease.`
` He was a man who liked big tricks, right?`
` ......He might have prepared a corpse from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet."`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Why would he do something like that...?!"`
`"......I'd agree if it was a normal person.`
` ...But this is Father we're talkin' about.`
` You can't say for sure that what Kyrie-san says is nonsense."`
`"............Because it's hard to tell whose body it is when the corpse is burnt. `
`However, there should be various ways to examine him from his teeth and his bone structure.`
` If the police investigated, of course they'd be able to know whose body it was all at once."`
`"The problem is that we need a telephone engineer more than the police right now."`
`"......The boats probably won't come in this typhoon.`
` ...So, will they come tomorrow?"`
`"Most likely, the boat will come again at 9:00 tomorrow.`
` Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police."`
`"......Both us, `
`and the culprit.`
` ...So until the typhoon passes, this island is closed off."`
`.........Just from the parents' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let's explain the situation anyway.`
` First, early that morning.`
` In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, of Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another.`
` First, Grandfather had been in the boiler room, completely burnt.`
` The servants had died, shut up in the various rooms throughout the mansion which had had magic circles drawn on them.`
` The cause of death for the servants was uncertain, `
`but according to Doctor Nanjo's diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear, `
`......or possibly shot by a gun.`
` That was why the adults had started arming themselves with the Winchesters.`
` And what made the situation even more chaotic was that the telephones had become unusable.`
` It was unknown whether lightning had caused them to break down or whether the culprit had destroyed it.`
` Anyway, since contact with the outside was broken off, we couldn't contact the police.`
` So until the typhoon passes and a boat comes tomorrow morning, `
`we will have to protect ourselves.`
` After all, Rokkenjima is now isolated by the typhoon.`
` And just like how we are stuck on the island, so is the culprit.`
` It seemed that the adults had stayed up the whole night, spending the whole time holding the family conference in the mansion's dining hall.`
` And even so, this crime had occurred in the mansion.`
`......So right when the adults had been in an uproar over money, `
`the murderer had been killing under the same roof...`
` They say that Natsuhi oba-san has been strict on locking the doors and windows for the night.`
` And yet, some suspicious person had entered the mansion.`
`...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large, `
`so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been.`
`.........Which brings us to the present.`
` George-aniki begged that he wanted to see Shannon-chan's corpse,`
` but the adults had refused, saying that he must not until the police arrived.`
` That wasn't just because they wanted to seal all the rooms to preserve the scene.`
`...After all, the culprit who had killed six people was wandering about the mansion.`
` To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion which should have been their home, `
`was like a danger zone that an unknown murderer had entered...`
` After all, the mansion is vast.`
` There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it is too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people.`
` In that sense, the guesthouse was a much smaller building than the mansion.`
` It was two stories above ground.`
` Were there about 10 rooms?`
`......Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a boarding house when the island was to be turned into a resort.`
` So it was easy to control, and easy to guarantee safety.`
` It was a good place to hole up in.`
`......And.`
` There was an extremely high likelihood that this mass murder of six people was a 'game'.`
` Because the culprit had proclaimed that in a letter.`
` I heard that a western-style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from Beatrice yesterday,`
` had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather's corpse had been discovered.`
` This was what the letter said.`
` So that there will be no misunderstandings.`
` The game I seek is for everyone to try and solve the riddle of the epitaph, `
`not for you to try and catch me.`
` If you don't solve the riddle of the epitaph, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number.`
` It would be more wise to spend your time solving the epitaph than searching for me.`
` If no one can solve the riddle of the epitaph, no one will survive.`
` If a person appears who can miraculously solve the riddle of the epitaph, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land,`
` the Ushiromiya family inheritance, and all of my power.`
` I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance from Kinzo-sama.`
` And, I look forward to seeing who will receive the inheritance from me.`
`――The Golden Witch, Beatrice.`
`...This riddle of the epitaph was, that thing.`
` That strange epitaph written on the portrait of the witch that was displayed in the hall of the mansion.`
` Grandfather was the one who ordered that it be written, `
`and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the inheritance or the hidden gold or something like that.`
` After it had been displayed there several years ago, even though the relatives had said it was stupid, `
`they had secretly challenged that riddle in the shadows.`
` However, up until today, no one had solved it.`
` We had once again been told to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we had been threatened that if we didn't solve it, we would all be killed.`
`......If this wasn't a game, what would you call it...`
` The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once.`
` However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there wasn't necessarily only one of them.`
` And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had stopped at 6.`
` In the end, the opinion that we should avoid carelessly antagonizing the culprit, `
`and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive won out...`
` After the adults had carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they had set up camp in the lobby.`
` And as they fingered their guns to distract themselves from the tension, `
`their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun...`
` There was nothing that I could do.`
` Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun,`
` to prepare for the off-chance that something would happen which led to an excess of guns......`
`......That's alright.`
` Just obediently stay there, me and the rest of you.`
`"............6 people in the beginning again.`
` And this time it's Grandfather and all of the servants put together."`
`"Most likely, `
`that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game.`
` And she surely made the best move by first taking the pieces she guessed that you were most likely to suspect."`
`"......That makes sense.`
` ...Both this time and the time before that.`
` The servants who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with keys are all the most suspicious people.`
`......A good example in the last game is Jessica's closed room.`
` If I had only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn't even have been a closed room."`
`"Therefore,`
` ......that child went straight for them.`
` She probably blocked the only way of escape that you are finally running towards."`
`"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island.`
`...Like, `
`...she's saying 'Give up'.`
`......Now I have to suspect one of the 18."`
`"......That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for the 18, and descending as a 19th person who shouldn't exist,`
` thereby making you accept that she is a witch.`
` ......That is because now that her intimidation strategy of trying to force you to surrender by showing you magic has failed,`
` she can only make a frontal attack."`
`"......Perfect.`
` Bluffing won't work anymore."`
`"Be careful.`
` Deception is a witch's strongest point.`
` ...No matter what that child says or shows you, `
`it definitely won't threaten the truth that you believe in.`
` Don't forget that."`
`".........Sure.`
` I'd hate it if the same moves worked over and over. `
`.........Come out, Beatrice.`
` Let's get started!!!"`
`"I am already seated at the table of the contest.`
` My turn is already complete."`
`"......Imagine that Madam would turn out to be our enemy.`
` How unfortunate, Milady.`
` ...Our moves will be read thoroughly."`
`"That is no problem.`
` Teacher's moves are all old-fashioned classics.`
` There is nothing to fear."`
`"...What moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you?`
` I am looking forward to seeing, Beatrice."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is that alright, Battleer?`
` If a person who denies witches such as yourself accepts a witch as a strategist..."`
`"That stupid provocation is useless.`
` This person is my advisor, no, my second. `
`That doesn't change one bit that this is a fistfight between you and me."`
`"I understand.`
` ......You're so wobbly that you probably need training wheels on your bicycle.`
` Do as you like. `
`Come, begin!!`
` It is your turn!"`
`"Let's begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene.`
` ......Virgilia, quickly please!"`
`"The first corpse discovered was Shannon's.`
` She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion.`
` The door and windows were locked, and a closed room was established."`
`"......Beato, give me an explanation.`
` Reconfirm the definition of a closed room."`
`"Hmm.`
` The term closed room refers to a room where the inside and the outside of the room are completely separated.`
` Obviously, for any form of intrusion or escape, no intervention is possible.`
` That comprehensively includes a denial of hidden doors, as well as all margin for intervention from the outside.`
`......Henceforth, this definition will be referred to as `
`'Beatrice's closed room definition!"`
`"Let me check the details.`
` ......What is your definition of 'margin for intervention from the outside'?"`
`"It refers to all types of direct intervention from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod.`
` In conclusion, there is no gap in the doors and windows where those tricks will work."`
`"I wonder.`
` Even if there wasn't a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?"`
`"Very well.`
` I add to this definition that it is impossible for radio waves and related methods of remote control to interfere."`
`"There's also an extension telephone in the parlor.`
` A device linked with that wouldn't count as remote control, right?!"`
`"Although the phones are already unusable.`
` ...Oh, that's a pain.`
` I'll include that too.`
` All direct and indirect methods of interfering from the outside of the room to the inside of the closed room are impossible."`
`"What about a voice or a knock?`
` Those should be able to interfere from the outside without entering the room, right?"`
`".........Even though it is a closed room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out.`
` Whether the room allows for a mutual understanding with the outside or not, it does not go against the definition of a closed room."`
`"In other words, you can't define it so that even methods of communication are interrupted?"`
`"That is the case."`
`"Understood.`
` .........So, Shannon-chan's parlor satisfies 'Beatrice's closed room definition'?"`
`"That is correct."`
`".........Closed room definition, understood.`
` Continue, Virgilia."`
`"Yes. `
`.........Shannon's corpse was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives who discovered her collected this."`
`"Beato, repeat it.`
` How many master keys this time?"`
`"...Hmph. The same as last time. `
`{p:1:There are five, one for each servant.}"`
`"Which means this still isn't a closed room.`
` There are still four master keys left.`
` It just means that after Shannon-chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it."`
`"That is correct.`
` .........And, it wasn't only a master key that was found."`
`"Yes. `
`......Alongside the corpse, there was a western envelope with the family crest.`
` Instead of a letter, the key to the guest room on the second floor was inside it."`
`"......The key to the second floor guest room...`
` The only key other than the master key that can open the door to the second floor guest room. Is that definition alright?"`
`"Hmm. There is no problem.`
` And, unlike the master keys, there is only one."`
`"In other words, in order to unlock that specific room, in addition to the five master keys,`
` this is the only one."`
`"......In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second floor guest room next?`
` So the adults moved to the second floor guest room?"`
`"Yes. `
`The door to the second floor guest room was locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it.`
` ......The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon's corpse. `
`Inside the room, Kumasawa's corpse was discovered.`
` The room was a closed room.`
` That definition is based upon 'Beatrice's closed room definition'.`
`.........Kumasawa was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this. `
`And like Shannon, there was a western envelope discovered alongside her.`
` Inside was the key to the third floor waiting room.`
` The relatives moved to the third floor waiting room."`
`"So there was a magic circle on the door to the third floor waiting room, and that door was locked?"`
`"Yes. `
`Inside the room, Gohda's corpse was discovered.`
` The room was a closed room.`
` Based on 'Beatrice's closed room definition'.`
`.........Gohda was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this. `
`And like up until now, a western envelope with a family seal was discovered.`
` Inside was the key to the second floor VIP room.`
` The relatives moved to the second floor VIP room."`
`".........What is all of this...?`
` What are you planning...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It isn't something worth glaring at me over, is it?`
` It is a closed room, but there are still several master keys that can open it, correct?`
` And in addition to the master keys, keys particular to each room have been presented."`
`"......I don't like how this is going. `
`......But I'm starting to see how things will turn out.`
` So it continues like this for all six people?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` Inside the second floor VIP room, Genji's corpse was discovered. `
`One master key was collected.`
` The key to the underground boiler room was discovered. `
`They moved to the underground boiler room.`
` Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo's corpse was discovered. `
`The key to the chapel was discovered. `
`They moved to the chapel. `
`Inside the chapel, Kanon's corpse was discovered.`
` One master key was collected.`
` The key to the first floor parlor was discovered.`
` ......With this, our reconstruction of how all six corpses were discovered is complete."`
`"A supplement.`
` Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the western envelope found near Kinzo's corpse.`
` The contents of the letter were as you saw.`
` It further urged the relatives to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`".........In that case...`
`...what's going on?`
` If the last place, where Kanon was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon was...`
` That makes six closed rooms, all tied together, right?"`
`"That is correct!`
` The six closed rooms are all tied together.`
` The keys to unlock each are all shut up inside the next room.`
` In other words, the six closed rooms form one massive closed room,`
` and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!`
`"`
`{p:1:Furthermore, all of the doors and windows in the six rooms are normal.`
` No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto-lock.}`
` *cackle*cackle*, what do you think, it's beautiful, isn't iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!"`
`"As I said, Milady, that is not dignified."`
`When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him shamelessly.`
`"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry.`
` I just got in such a good mood playing with Battler. `
`*cackle*, so, Battleer?`
` What do you think of my move?`
` If you can't think of anything in particular, I can show you how I made the goats carry the corpses, `
`and seal all of the rooms with magiiic?"`
`"Do what you want.`
` I'll listen respectfully to this 'magic theory' that you assert.`
` However, I can assert my 'human theory',`
` which is completely different from your claim, without any interference from your claim.`
` So, in other words!`
` There's no need for me to listen to your bullshit!!`
` Act out how you lock the door with your seven-colored magic by waving your magic staff or something as much as you like.`
` And while you're doing that, you can act out your toad oil and all-purpose kitchen knife! `
`Virgilia, let's reconstruct the crime scene!`
` Search for a weakness!!`
` Were they all definitely dead?`
` If one of them is just playing dead, this isn't a closed room at all!"`
`"Nanjo checked that all of them were dead.`
` However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis.`
` ......In other words, she cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked the fact that they were alive equal to zero."`
`"Here it is, that 'Devil's Proof'.`
` But there exists a sword which can carve that up...!"`
`"Wh, what are those people doing?`
` ......Looks like they're having a good time leaving me out of the discussion.`
` I am their opponent, right...?`
` Even though I told him to prepare himself..."`
`"Originally, as when competing in chess, communication with the opponent is not necessary. `
`......You spoke in riddles when you communicated and weren't making your moves, Milady.`
` ...Perhaps it has come to this because he does not want to be led astray."`
`"............Muu.`
` ......For some reason, I can't accept it."`
`"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not, Milady?"`
`"That's true, but...`
`...muu!"`
`Beatrice puffed out her cheeks, as though saying 'I don't know why, but I don't like it!'`
`"Because the police have not yet arrived at the scene, the human side's ability to prove things is limited.`
` For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend that you have her repeat it."`
`"Alright, that's where I'll strike, repeat it!! `
`'The six victims are all dead'!!"`
`"......Milady, he has told you to repeat something, has he not?"`
`"Hey, enough lazing around!!`
` Do you refuse to repeat it?!`
` This is where our battle starts!!"`
`"Wha?!`
` Owowowowoow!! `
`*cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry, that's fine, I'll answer.`
`"`
`{p:1:6 people: Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa are dead!}"`
`"Why are you so out of it? `
`...Alright.`
` So the first one has been removed.`
` That shortcut that they're pretending to be dead has been denied from the beginning."`
`"*cackle*!`
` I won't go easy on you anymore, come at me how you like.`
` I'll slice them slantwise one after another!"`
`"Then repeat this! `
`No one is hiding in any of the six rooms!`
` Show me that you can deny the existence of people we aren't aware of!"`
`"I'll answer. `
`"`
`{p:1:There is no one hiding in the six rooms!}"`
`"Alright.`
` Now I'm sure that it's only the six of them in the can.`
` And they aren't pretending to be dead."`
`"......What will you do, what will you dooo?`
` Even though there's already nothing a human could do.`
` Obediently kneel to the fact that I can control locks at will with my wonderful magic, alriiiiiiight?"`
`"Quit babbling.`
` Repeat this too. `
`'The six deaths were instant deaths'!"`
`"Instant death?`
` Hoh, what do you mean by that?"`
`"......It means there is a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room, `
`and after locking it from the inside to create a closed room, they passed away."`
`"...Hmph.`
` A classic closed room murder.`
` In the case where it is determined that the victim received the wound, and then died sometime after that.`
` It is possible that a closed room could be constructed unexpectedly if the victim holed up inside the room to escape the murderer,`
` and then died after locking it."`
`"In order to deny that possibility, `
`you will need to proclaim that 'the six people died instantly' with the red truth."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Very well, very well, I'll slay you with my red treasured sword! `
`"`
`{p:1:The six people died instantly!}`
` By instant death, I mean that as soon as they were attacked, they became incapable of action.`
` Well, in its full meaning, it could take several seconds or even minutes for them to die.`
` But no matter what, it would be completely impossible for them to take any action of their own will.`
` In that sense, I can state that they died instantly!"`
`"...Everything up until now has just been checking for a classic closed room.`
` My showdown with you over the closed rooms starts now, alright...? `
`If the culprit isn't on the inside, they are on the outside.`
` So they somehow killed them from outside the rooms."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Have you lost your mind?`
` Doesn't 'a closed room=murder is impossible from the outside'?!`
` Therefore, it's impossible for it to be anything other than a magical murder!"`
`"No, that's wrong. `
`The right thing to say is 'a murder really happened=it isn't a closed room'!`
` No matter how much you speak in riddles, this definitely isn't a closed room! `
`It's a sham that only looks like a closed room!"`
`"However, Battler-sama. `
`{p:1:Only the victims are inside the rooms, `
`and no other people exist inside the rooms.} `
`And by Milady's closed room definition,`
` remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?"`
`"Wait.`
` The definition of remote murders is vast, right? `
`It's not just about pulling a fishing line from outside the room `
`and strangling the victim inside the room. `
`For example, ......`
` a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!"`
`"A traap?`
` Hoh, what is that?!"`
`"Just as an example, let's say they were instructed to enter previously decided rooms, `
`and lock the doors from the inside to create a closed room themselves.`
` A trap is set up in those rooms that they don't know about, `
`and they are killed by that. `
`......How's that?! Now your contradiction doesn't work!"`
`"......There is no problem.`
` It corresponds to the existing state."`
`"...There is no problem on our side either.`
` It does not conflict with Milady's closed room definition."`
`"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's with that stupid reasoning?!`
` Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, right? `
`What form did that trap have?!`
` Where was it hidden and how did it operate?!`
` Explain that for all six people, in the parlor, the guest room, the waiting room, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel.`
` Well? You can't, can you?!?!"`
`"I refuse to counter that!! `
`There is no need for me to explain that!!`
` And even so, it doesn't damage my claim!!"`
`"Wh, what did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!"`
`"Beatrice, it is a 'Devil's Proof'. `
`The fact that he cannot explain the form of the trap, `
`does not in itself deny that there was a trap!"`
`"............Well done.`
` While overbearing, a wonderful move."`
`"...Ku!!!`
` This guy is getting completely used to this......!!"`
`"Check.`
` Due to murder trap X that they couldn't find, it is possible to establish this closed room murder."`
`"......Ah, I'll kill that check with the red truth!! `
`"`
`{p:1:The six people were not killed by traps}!"`
`"The definition of trap?!"`
`"Oh, `
`...umm, `
`...that's it!`
` Something invoked when a victim gets caught in it by their own actions. `
`Aaah..., that's not all!`
` Things invoked by remote control or by a timer,`
` ......everything like that is also included!"`
`"Pu ku ku...`
` All devices that can succeed in murder without the direct participation of the person who set it up.`
` I believe that definition may be appropriate."`
`"H, how's that?!`
` I've struck back!! `
`As though I could let a human defeat this closed room!!"`
`"............`
`............You are also frantic, trying to win."`
`"...Whaat...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"......You are also frantically fighting to make me accept that you exist.`
` Until now, I've thought that I was just being toyed around with by you one-sidedly.`
`...But that was actually wrong.`
` You are also frantically resisting my comeback, fighting to show that you exist...!`
` Now, `
`...I finally really feel that's true."`
`This isn't torture inflicted on me about whether I'll surrender or not.`
`"This is a fight between you and me on an even footing!! `
`......Alright, it's starting to get interesting, isn't it?`
` Six people died in closed rooms, and no outsiders were inside.`
` And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps.`
` If I were to continue in the same way I have been up until now, I would probably think this had to be the work of magic.`
`......And if you had acted out some strange magic, I'd probably even surrender.`
` .........It's that favorite strategy of yours.`
` ...You completely intercept all of my moves, and in the moment that I've tried everything and fallen to my knees, `
`when my heart's defensive power is at its weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!"`
`".........She has always had a short temper.`
` She still has that bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Because Milady cannot stand putting off a match."`
`"Heeey, shut up, shut up!! `
`It's Battler's turn, right?!`
` I have finished off the 'trap piece' that you have advanced!`
` What should I repeat next?`
` Show me what you've got!!"`
`"Right!! `
`Now that even a trap has been defeated, at a glance, this looks like a perfect closed room murder.`
` ......And that's why this is where I'll turn the chessboard over!!"`
`"...Here it is, your special technique!`
` What and how are you going to turn things over?!`
` Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll show you!!`
` It's not about thinking how to kill six people inside closed rooms from the outside! `
`Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless!`
` That's right, it's not about how to kill from the outside.`
` It's about how they died inside the room and created a closed room!`
`......That's it, this is the answer!!`
` If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit, `
`this closed room can be explained extremely easily!"`
`"Wh, whaaaaaaat?! `
`No way!`
` I believe I clearly said in red that the six people were dead......!!"`
`"6 people did die.`
` Five were victims who were killed.`
` If you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this closed room!!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` If the culprit locked themselves in the final closed room, `
`and threw away their own life, this closed room chain would be established."`
`"The culprit's suicide.`
` ...Normally, it is an unthinkable move, `
`but the argument that it doesn't exist because it is unthinkable, `
`doesn't exist.`
` ......And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive.`
` A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!"`
`"......Well, you cannot say for certain that there is no motive.`
` ...For example, it has been announced that Kinzo only had a short time left to live.`
` He did not regret losing his short remaining life, and he used his own death as a message.`
` ...It may not be impossible to attach that motive. `
`.........Milady.`
` It is our turn."`
`"U, ...urg!`
` Imagine that you would even trample on the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...!`
` What a heartless, cold-blooded man...!"`
`"Setting up the dead as the culprit.`
` ...This move is worse than inhuman, and it's one you used to attack Kanon-kun in the last game. `
`......Even though the games are different, I'm taking a shot back at you with this move,`
` as a tribute to Kanon-kun for that time.`
` Just now, I have freed that Kanon-kun from his regrets!!"`
`"Ku......, kuuuuuuu......!!"`
`"You have no duty to hold back here. `
`You should check whether suicide was not the cause of death for any of them.`
` I recommend that you have her repeat it."`
`"Right!!`
` But suicide is a naive word that won't corner her!!`
` Beato, this is the end!! `
`Repeat it!! `
`'The six were all killed by other people'!!"`
`"...............That is painful."`
`"Uguu...!!`
` .....................Ku, ooohh...!"`
`"Hmmmm?`
` What's wrong, six people were killed, right?! `
`I'm just checking the simplest premise from the very beginning, right?`
` Can't you repeat it?!"`
`"Fu, ......I refuse to repeat it.`
` ...Th, there's no reason in particular."`
`"Refusing to repeat this part is the same as resigning, right?! `
`Checkmate!!`
` One of the six was the culprit, and they decided on suicide after constructing the closed room!`
` That's all!!"`
`"...W, wait!`
` No, umm, ......I'll say it, I'll say it!`
` I'll use the red like you want! `
`{p:1:None of the six people committed suicide!} `
`How's that?!`
` Are you satisfied...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka!`
` I've struck back, I've struck back!!!"`
`"Heh, `
`......what the hell, so you can say it...`
`...But isn't that weird?`
` Why are you so panicked...?"`
`"......I, i, it's your imagination.`
` I am also frantic this time, right?`
` That's right, I don't have any leeway.`
` Don't pay it any mind..."`
`"......That which you demanded she repeat has been falsified.`
` Do not be fooled."`
`"..................Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` It seems it was useless, Milady."`
`"Th, that's right! `
`She didn't say 'the six were all killed by other people'.`
` She changed it to 'none of the six committed suicide'!`
` Which means that one of the people was not killed by someone else and didn't commit suicide. `
`.........Aaaaaaaahhh, `
`I've got it, I've got it!! `
`This is the truth!"`
`"After culprit X, who was hiding among the 6, committed murder, they constructed a closed room.`
` ......Then they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method.`
` However, there was an accident!!`
` The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn't expected, and constructed a closed room that even they hadn't desired!! `
`Now it's over, Beatrice!!`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"D, ......damn iiiit!! `
`Did you think I would be cornered by something like that!!`
` I would never scream my resignation over something like that!! `
`I'll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!!`
` An accidental death among the six people was, `
`Muga?!`
` Fugagaga, what are you doing, fugafuga!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Our side requests some time to strategize.`
` Please allow us a brief postponement."`
`"......It is a just request.`
` Is there any problem?"`
`"Nope!! I approve!`
` I've been given those a lot lately.`
` This time it's your turn to use it...!!"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Come, Milady, ......this way.`
` And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads."`
`"Fugafugafuga!! `
`Funohehe, funofe-!! `
`Fuga-!"`
`Ronove quickly covered Beato's mouth with his hand as she grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, and suspended the game.`
` He then called for a strategy conference and pulled Beato away...`
`"......Damn.`
` That demon butler.`
` When Beato got all hot, that was an ideal chance to corner her..."`
`Beato normally behaved elegantly, but she actually had a really short temper and got mad easily.`
`......Common sense is hidden once a person becomes agitated.`
`"Ronove is composed.`
` ...He probably gave that child some time to cool her head.`
` ......That child was stubbornly trying to remove your check, `
`and was going to easily let several large pieces go.`
` ...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish.`
` ......That child mistook her timing."`
`"......So, what does it mean?`
` Did I create a checkmate, or didn't I?"`
`"That child was going to proclaim it in red.`
` It probably wouldn't have become checkmate yet.`
` ......But, probably, `
`that child will proclaim her resignation once she has cooled her head."`
`"...Imagine that.`
` Even though she hates losing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try and minimize your losses.`
` ......The difficult part is measuring whether it is a losing battle or not.`
` ...It seems that that child's butler calmly made that decision."`
`"......Oh well.`
` In other words, in another second, she would have gotten away.`
` ......It's not like`
` I can get checkmate and deliver the final blow so easily."`
`"However, you should measure this as your victory.`
` It seems that they barely prevented a large loss, `
`but without a doubt, they received a large amount of damage.`
` ......You should be able to understand well the depths of that wound by watching her panic."`
`"Seriously.`
` Ihihihi, it feels like she'd start crying if I bullied her any more than this."`
`As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a mysterious expression.`
`...She didn't have the same bold smile as usual, but it looked like the blood wasn't rushing to her head anymore.`
`".........Hey.`
` It's your turn.`
` Did you decide your next move?"`
`"I resign.`
` ......For now, I will let you have your victory."`
`Beato told me that frankly.`
` It seemed as though she had taken a far-sighted view, as though saying 'if you want to laugh, then laugh'.`
`......It was a bit of a kill-joy, and I lost my desire to deliver the final blow.`
`"Well, now that you've resigned, in the end, `
`all that means is that we're even, since my theory and yours can't deny each other.`
` You should treat it more like a tie than a loss."`
`"......I don't need your disgusting compassion.`
` I say that this time, it is my loss.`
` ...When you find a dog drenched with rain, do you have the habit of whacking it with a stick or something?"`
`"Nope.`
` Unlike you."`
`"........................"`
`Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, she was so pathetic when it was her turn.`
` I think she's a pretty unfair person, but I decided to act with dignity as a winner and accepted it.`
`......Beato had resigned.`
` That was the only result of the first twilight.`
` Beatrice couldn't counter my move of 'one of the six was the culprit, `
`and that person died in an accident'.`
`...No, she probably could have countered it, but because of some strategic decision, she had given up.`
` Stronger than my feelings of victory was the sense that I had just escaped for one more step...`
` In my chess match with the witch, I had only been able to fight by advancing a piece X which didn't require explanation.`
` Thanks to the 'Devil's Proof', I could create as many strange fictions as I wanted, and use them to fight in the argument.`
`...But that only mattered for the chess match with the witch.`
`......In our human world, such an abstract story can't explain anything.`
` The first twilight today was a chain of six closed rooms.`
`...It certainly may be possible for a human.`
` Beato hadn't been able to completely deny everything.`
` However, I don't have a clue who committed the crime,`
` why, and how they actually did it...`
` Even if I won...`
`......I get the feeling that things would have been clearer`
` if Beatrice had been able to state that it was completely impossible for a human.`
` I had fooled her with an abstract piece called X.`
`............But I couldn't deny that some kind of unthinkable,`
` creepy intention was filling up this mansion...`
