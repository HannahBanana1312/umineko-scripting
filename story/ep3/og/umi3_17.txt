`"Dad..., ......Mom......!!`
` Who would do something like this...?!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...`
` Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.`
`...After Jessica had looked in the rose garden where Rosa oba-san and Maria had fallen and seen nothing, `
`she had gone to look in the arbor next.`
` Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.`
`......Unexpectedly, even Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san, `
`had their days where they relaxed and enjoyed their tea together there.`
`......In that arbor lay the corpses of Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san.`
` At least they aren't drenched in the rain like Rosa oba-san and Maria had been, `
`but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at the moment...`
`"......What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Str, ...strangulation, I believe. `
`...Come, take a look at this.`
` On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."`
`"Right. `
`......I doubt that these things were the primary cause for their deaths. "`
`...There lay two stake-like weapons decorated with an occult design, `
`which had been found driven into Krauss oji-san's thigh area, `
`and near Natsuhi oba-san's calf.`
` When we had found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest, `
`we had decided to leave them for the police and to preserve the crime scene, `
`......but Jessica didn't care about such matters and had immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies.`
`"......By now, bodies gouged in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg have been found."`
`"Oooooooohhhhh, damn it damn it damn it!!`
` I'll kill that murderer, kill him!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"......With this, the eighth twilight has been completed.`
` ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?`
` ......The witch shall be revived, and none shall be left alive."`
`"Bring it on...`
`......If the witch revives, `
`...that means the culprit is going to make his grand appearance, right?! `
`No one's going to be left alive? Bullshit...`
`......I'll kill him...!`
` I'll make sure I kill the culprit who killed Dad and Mom with my own hands...!!"`
`Jessica let her emotions flow out as she howled furiously.`
`......To avoid being crushed by her grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.`
`"......We still, ...haven't found George.`
` ...Jessica, you children better stay here.`
` I'll go in the mansion."`
`"E, Eva-san, we mustn't split up...!! `
`It is dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"`
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii-san or his wife. `
`But George may be still alive somewhere...!`
` I have no time to waste here...!!"`
`As Eva oba-san screamed this, Jessica glared at her.`
`...Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.`
` She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who had yet to be seen.`
`"Jessica-chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side.`
` I'll make a short trip to the mansion.`
` Battler-kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here as well."`
`After arbitrarily saying this, Eva oba-san rushed out of the arbor.`
` I called out to stop her, but there was no way she would listen.`
`...However, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.`
` If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.`
` Since Eva oba-san was unwilling to stop, we had no choice but to follow her.`
`......And, while it may be cruel to say so, `
`Krauss oji-san and Natsuhi oba-san were already dead, `
`so there was nothing more we could do for them...`
` In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.`
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.`
` Perhaps she had been able to break free from her grief.`
`......But, what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon.`
`"...I'll kill that person with my hands, ......I'll make sure I avenge them.........`
`......Let's go, Battler.`
` If we find the culprit, don't get in my way.`
` I'm definitely going to kill them...!!"`
`".........I also have my parents to avenge.`
` Sorry, but this is first come, first serve."`
`"...Yeah, ...that's right...`
`......Let's kill them!"`
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like we sympathized with her emotions.`
` She still had that dark expression, but I felt that Jessica had regained some of her sanity.`
` We took off.`
` Chasing after Eva oba-san.`
` Through the rose garden, `
`up the stone steps, `
`running at full speed towards the mansion......whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.`
`......With this, the murders of the epitaph have reached the eighth twilight.`
` And then, at the ninth twilight, the witch will revive.`
`...None shall be left alive.`
` I will most likely lose my life.`
`......But at the very least, I want to burn the truth into my eyes.`
` That is the only thing motivating me to move at the moment.`
` We were able to reunite with Eva oba-san, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.`
` It seemed that all the blood had risen to Eva oba-san's head.`
` That was probably making her fingers clumsy.`
` It seemed she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.`
`...Then, there was a faint sound.`
` The sound of the door unlocking.`
` Just as though it had waited for all of the survivors to unite before opening.`
` It seemed to me as though the malicious mansion,`
` was trying to swallow all of the remaining humans at once...`
` Perhaps the stench that erupted outwards the instant the door opened,`
` ...couldn't be described as just a smell.`
` It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather.`
`......I think it also may have contained the regrets of the servants and Dad's group,`
` ...all of the dead.`
`...What did it mean as it floated out, overwhelming us?`
`......Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter? `
`However, Eva oba-san didn't even flinch at something like that.`
`......And we who had to chase after her,`
` were forced to step into the mansion, even though we had received that message...`
`"George?! `
`George!! `
`If you can hear me, answer! `
`Geoooooorge!!"`
`Eva oba-san shouted at the top of her lungs.`
`......Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive.`
` When we also started following Eva oba-san's example and calling George's name in loud voices...`
`...Eva oba-san found something, and stopped walking.`
` She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.`
`".........What is this.........? `
`D, Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second......?"`
`"Wh, what is it......?"`
`I had heard about the eerie magic circles written on doors such as the one to the parlor from the adults.`
`......Eerie is the only word to describe that thing, `
`which was scribbled with a deep-red paint reminiscent of blood so that it slowly dripped down.`
` However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.`
`......Wondering why Eva oba-san, who had supposedly seen it already, `
`would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...`
`"......Certainly, .........I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."`
`"Right, they weren't.`
` ......Eerie magical characters were written here, but not numbers."`
`From what the two of them said, only the magic circle had been there here this morning.`
` However, right now, there were eight digits written in the upper part of the magic circle.`
` 07151129.`
`...I didn't know what it meant, `
`but I didn't even want to imagine what someone had been thinking when they wrote it.`
` It was drawn with the same paint as the magic circle,`
` ...but it had clearly been written very recently.`
` The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.`
`".........Heh.`
` I'm sure it just has some magical meaning.`
` It's pointless to think about it too deeply."`
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to wipe out how eerie it was.`
`"It, ...could be a magic square.`
` ......The idea that a talisman can reside in a certain form of number play. `
`I believe everyone has heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."`
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers buried in a rectangle?`
` This is just a single row.`
` I don't have a clue what it could mean. `
`......What Jessica-chan said is probably correct.`
` There isn't any point in us thinking about it deeply..."`
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it might actually mean something.`
` Using an old receipt or something from inside her pocket,`
` Eva oba-san deftly wrote that number down with a short ballpoint pen.`
` Without any kind of pattern, that eight digit number would probably be a pretty difficult code to break.`
`........................`
`"......Couldn't, `
`......this be a date, `
`......or something?"`
`"A date...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence, `
`but my birthday, `
`is July 15. `
`...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15,`
` I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29, maybe that'd fit perfectly..."`
`"............Why would your birthday be written in a place like this?`
` And what's up with November 29...?"`
`"That's what I wanna know...`
` Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence.`
` When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy. `
`......What if someone's birthday was November 29?`
` Everyone in my family has a different birthday, Dad and Kyrie-san and Ange.`
` And of course, my mom too."`
`"I cannot think of anything...`
`...I don't believe it is Kinzo-san's or Genji-san's birthday."`
`"It isn't from my family either.`
` And it isn't Rosa's or Maria-chan's."`
`"Even my family has different birthdays...`
` And it isn't Kanon-kun's or Shannon's. `
`......I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,`
` but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29..."`
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits, which we had thought were meaningless,`
` were actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.`
`......However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.`
` Anyways, since we don't have any real clue, it's probably pointless to stand around here worrying about it.`
`......Even more important than that was the inside of the parlor.`
` This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them had been the body of a victim.`
`...And, now that a number had been added to the door, had something new been added inside the parlor? `
`When Eva oba-san tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.`
` She immediately took out a master key, putting it in the keyhole.`
` As soon as she opened the door, ......Eva oba-san let out a high-pitched scream and ran inside.`
` That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...`
` Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...`
`"George!! `
`Geooooorge!! `
`Hang in there...!!`
` Geoooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"`
`George-aniki had fallen alongside Shannon-chan's corpse.`
` His chest was stained bright red.`
` And from his still opened eyes,`
` ...I'd hate to say it to Eva oba-san, `
`......but I couldn't pick up any signs of life.`
` After moving to take George's pulse, `
`...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George was dead.`
` Brushing him aside, Eva oba-san once again crouched beside George-aniki,`
` and started crying at the top of her lungs...`
` With this, ...Aniki's death, one thing is certain.`
` The murders hadn't ended at the eighth twilight.`
` The epitaph was being carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, 'and no one will be left alive'...`
` I was really starting to lose track of things.`
`...For some reason, Eva oba-san's half-insane cries actually made me cool down...`
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa `
`and plunked my feet on top of the table.`
` Maybe all of these murders had paralyzed my heart.`
` Instead of just being frightened, I felt completely confused.`
` Dad and Kyrie-san died, and starting with the servants, people have been killed off one by one.`
`...And there's been a hell of a lot of them by now.`
` I don't know what time the first murders started,`
` ...but they probably weren't killed with the speed of a single person.`
` We believe that the boat will come for us around 9:00 tomorrow.`
`......There's still a full 12 hours until then.`
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch will there have to be for us to survive...? `
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours.`
` We don't even know if we'll last until midnight tonight...`
`......Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.`
` About the time that the discussion had turned to the black tea that Rosa oba-san had bought or something, `
`we kids had started talking about going to take a walk.`
`......Maria had been fooling around.`
`...Hadn't Shannon-chan brought us some cookies? `
`She had said that Kumasawa-san had baked them, or something.`
`......I'd probably have laughed if she had actually baked some mackerel in them.`
`............That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa-chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...`
`...Oh yeah, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa-chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...`
`............Why did Dad and Kyrie-san, ...even go outside? `
`It's not like we'd die from being without food for a day.`
`...And yet, why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go to get food?`
`......I'll bet that Dad was trying to act tough and started complaining about being hungry...`
` Kyrie-san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...`
` Why didn't you stop him?`
`.........And, what about your daughter, Ange...? `
`She's still six years old.`
` You weren't thinking of entrusting her to me, were you...? `
`It's doubtful that even I'll be able to leave this island alive.........`
`"S, stop...!!`
` Why are you fighting at a time such as this...?! `
`Jessica-san, stop...!!"`
`......It's been kinda noisy for a while.`
` By the time I looked up to see what it was, Jessica and Eva oba-san had suddenly started fighting each other.`
`......No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Eva oba-san.`
`"......Eva oba-san killed Dad and the rest!!`
` There's no other explanation!!"`
`"How foolish!!`
` How would I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"`
`"Who was on the first floor of the guesthouse?!`
` Eva oba-san!!`
` Dad and Mom were in the first floor lobby, along with Eva oba-san!`
` Who was left alive?!`
` Only Eva oba-san!!`
` Why? `
`It's obviously because you're the culprit!! `
`You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,`
` trying to make it seem like it was the witch's doing...!!"`
`"Then why do you think George disappeared?! `
`He didn't come down to the first floor, right?!`
` So did he disappear from the second floor?!`
` Who was on the second floor?!`
` You people were there, right?!! `
`You knew, didn't you?!`
` You knew how George slipped out of the mansion!!`
` You brazenly made a face as if you didn't know anything!!`
` If you had stopped George, he would, ......he would...!!!"`
`"I am telling you to stop...!`
` Jessica-san was in the cousins' room the whole time!`
` And Eva-san was also in the first floor lobby the whole time!`
` And neither of you are responsible for anything!`
` This is only the sadness of losing those of your family...!! `
`The culprit is no one, is nowhere...!!`
` It is all, .........just the witch's fault!!`
` So stop hating each other, you two...!!"`
`......The witch's fault, is it...`
` I wonder if that's a good way to mediate things for now.`
` Yes, ...I finally understand why three people evaporated from the guesthouse, when all of the doors and windows had been locked from the inside...`
` This is what they were after.`
`......Making us think the culprit was inside, ...and causing this ugly mutual hatred,`
` ......had to be the culprit's, ......the witch's goal.`
`............But in that case, how had the culprit locked it from the outside...? `
`When Dad's group had been attacked, the master key had certainly been stolen.`
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse `
`had been constructed so that you couldn't lock them from the outside no matter how hard you tried.`
` So that master key shouldn't have meant anything for the guesthouse closed room...`
` Jessica and Eva oba-san were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.`
` Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.`
`......And I sat in the sofa staring up at the ceiling,`
` ......thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn out expression.`
`............I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,`
` ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit......`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......, `
`uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half-asleep trance.`
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Eva oba-san held.`
` Jessica had fallen on the floor, covering both her eyes.`
` Eva oba-san and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her, shocked...`
`"A, are you alright, Jessica-san...?!`
` Jessica-san...!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, `
`it hurts, it hurts, it hurts..., `
`rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh..."`
`"I, ......it isn't my fault...`
` Th, ......this happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"`
`"H, ...hey, wait a sec, what's going on...?!"`
`Jessica had grabbed at Eva oba-san, and it had turned into a scuffle...`
` Had they then started fighting over the gun Eva oba-san had been holding? `
`Did some kind of impact cause the trigger to be pulled...? `
`I didn't know the details about whether the bullet had grazed her, or whether she had been burned by the discharge,`
` but anyways, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming 'it hurts, it hurts' and rolling around on the floor.`
`"......It's alright, calm down...!`
` It is not a serious wound, so get a hold of yourself...!"`
`"My eyes hurt, it hurts..., `
`...I can't see, `
`...I can't see......!!"`
`Doctor Nanjo let Jessica borrow his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.`
`......The servant room in this mansion had a bed and a first aid kit, and was able to function as an infirmary.`
`"Damn iiiiiit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad!!`
` I'll kill you..., I'll kill you......!!"`
`"I, ......it wasn't me..., it wasn't me......!!"`
`"Jessica-san, you are aggravating the wound, so don't act so reckless...!`
` Come, let us go to the servant room..."`
`Jessica cursed Eva oba-san as her parents' murderer even more than she had before.`
` It seemed that Eva oba-san couldn't conceal her trembling at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.`
`"...It wasn't my fault..., this happened because that kid jumped at me......`
`......I didn't kill anyone...`
`......More importantly, ...who killed George?`
` That's right, who killed George?!!`
` George, Geooooooooooorge!!`
` It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!"`
`"W, wait a sec, Eva oba-san...!!`
` Don't go off on your own!!"`
`I didn't know whether it was because Eva oba-san couldn't stand her mistake,`
` or whether it was because she had given up control of her body to anger at the person who had killed her only son,`
` ...or whether it was both of those all mixed together.`
`...Anyways, yelling, fearful, and shouting, she ran out into the corridor.`
` I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but anyways, right then, I couldn't leave Eva oba-san alone.`
` Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?! `
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.`
`...I chased after Eva oba-san, dashing into the depths of the mansion......`
` After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,`
` Nanjo told her several times not to touch her eyes, and examined the affected area.`
` The barrel had probably been near her eyes.`
` There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had injured her corneas.`
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to have a suitable doctor look at her as soon as possible.`
` Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.`
` As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...`
`"Is that alright...?`
` This wound may hurt or itch, but you must not scratch at it or rub it.`
` When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."`
`"......That bitch, she really was trying to kill me...`
` If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now...`
` I'll definitely turn her in to the police......!"`
`"...Eva-san would not do such a thing.`
` That was an accident."`
`"You call that an accident...?! `
`She killed Dad and Mom.`
` There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!`
` She's behind everything.`
` She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse! `
`George nii-san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him silent!!`
` It's the same with Grandfather and the servants.`
` I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"`
`"......I, if that is the case, then we will know as soon as the police investigate. `
`The police are incredible, and with their ability to discern, there is nothing that cannot be understood.`
` ......There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.`
` The police will resolve everything.`
` So for now, Jessica-san, you should devote yourself to resting your body and keeping your eyes safe.`
` ...Of course, if you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do nothing good for the beauty of your eyes."`
`In actuality, when Jessica grew agitated in her abuse of Eva, `
`she had naturally started glaring, and the pressure on her eyes hurt her.`
` Jessica herself realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,`
` and regardless of whether she had overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...`
`".........She killed them...`
`......Dad and Mom.`
` ......And Shannon, `
`............and Kanon-kun...`
`............Kanon-kun........."`
`She had heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.`
`...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died.`
` Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she was blinded,`
` and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's body away while she still couldn't see,`
` and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to see his face.`
` Her anger at the culprit, and her sadness at the death of the person she had liked.`
`...Those mixed emotions started her crying.`
` But right now, tears were actually painful for her,`
` so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember his face in bygone days...`
` Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...`
`"............`
`...Well then, now I am worried more about Eva-san.`
` I hope she isn't to shaken by this."`
`Realizing that Jessica had calmed down for the time being and letting out a sigh, `
`he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.`
`"............"`
`Then, their eyes met.`
` Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.`
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti-magic power and magic resistance power. `
`In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now.`
` Understand what that means?"`
`"......Wh, ......what did you say......?"`
`There was no reason Nanjo should have been able to understand who the person in front of him was.`
`...Furthermore, there was even less reason for him to understand what she had just said.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo?`
` What's going on......?"`
`Unable to see, Jessica couldn't tell what was going on except by whatever voice she heard.`
`...But since she had heard Nanjo say something with an uneasy tone,`
` she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.`
`"S, ......stop, please......!`
` Please don't kill me...!!`
` I have a sick grandchild...!`
` I can't die here...!`
` Please, spare me...!!`
` Eeeek!!!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Doctor Nanjo?!"`
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed.`
`...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, confronting someone.`
` And he was scared.`
` His life must have been threatened just a second ago.`
`"No, stop it!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`"At the ninth twilight, the Witch shall be revived, and none shall be left alive. `
`Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"`
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.`
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do, `
`Nanjo imagined that she must be trying to take his life.`
`"Doctor Nanjo!! `
`Doctor Nanjo!! `
`Is someone there?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, ahiiieeeeeeeeehhh!!"`
`*bang*!`
` A sharp sound echoed.`
` And just as sharply, the tip of the golden staff tapered and stretched, slicing into Nanjo's forehead...`
` Jessica, who could only try to grasp what was happening with her ears, had no clue what was going on.`
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.`
` And, that person was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.`
`...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't be able to run away, much less resist.`
`...Knowing that she was a mouse in a trap and in a life or death situation, Jessica shuddered...`
`"......Oh, Jessica.`
` How sad, your eyes got injured.`
` ...In that case, you can't even escape.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now.`
` ...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more.`
`......No wait, it's not every day that you get blinded, right?`
` ......I won't wait until I kill you.`
` I'll play around a bunch before I kill you too. `
`...Kuhhihyahyahyahya...!!`
` So wait there shaking for a while, okay?`
` As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!"`
`"E, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!!"`
`Jessica was struck with fear, and let out a frail scream.`
`......She really wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.`
` But she couldn't.`
` When faced with true fear, it clogs up a person's throat...`
` Right now, Jessica could barely even breathe.`
`"H, `
`......help me..., `
`......help me.........!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeekk!!"`
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.`
` But even though she should have known this room well, just being unable to see made it like a closed room of darkness.`
` She ran into a shelf or something, and something like a candy jar and candy fell down, hitting her on the head.`
`...As she was now, it was doubtful that she would even protect her head to block it.`
`...She was painfully aware of how powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.`
` Of course, she had no time to admire that.`
` At any rate, she crawled around, trying to escape that place,`
` but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects,`
` and it felt like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.`
` Then, a footstep could be heard from the presence in the hallway.`
` And then a voice.`
`......She had probably peered into the room since Jessica had been so noisy.`
`"You really are noisy.`
` Act like a lady and wait by sitting on the bed.`
` 'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood-red death costume fitting for an honored daughter.`
` ......Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay? `
`Gehheheheheheheheheheh!!"`
`"Eee, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!"`
`Until just a second ago, she had sworn that she would kill the culprit if she found them.`
`...However, she was now very powerless.`
` She couldn't do anything except let out a scream, crawling around on the floor and bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.`
`"Help me..., help me......!`
` Someone, help me......!!`
` Dad, ......Mom...!`
` Battleeeer......!`
` Someone, coooooooome...!!`
` .........Help me, ......Kanon-kun.........!!"`
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life...`
`......A single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.`
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.`
` The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.`
`...Its form was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.`
` Even just the power to preserve a human form had become scarce for her.`
` Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.`
`"......Jessica will probably be unable to survive.`
` ...Although since the beginning, no one was to be left alive."`
`"...............That person has grown feelings of love for Kanon.`
` ......I have toyed with that at times.`
` ............However, doing such a thing should be shameful for a witch."`
`"......Love is the single element.`
` Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.`
` ...For some reason, you are very much hated for that, Milady."`
`"........................`
`......Teacher told me.`
` ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.`
` ...I also should have known that in the past.`
`......And since the time I forgot that, I stopped being a witch.`
` ......So I, ...lost the qualifications to be Battler's opponent..."`
`".........I can hardly believe it, Milady.`
` ......Do you intend to rescue Jessica?`
` It will be dangerous."`
`"I understand...`
` Even if I save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens. `
`......But even so, ...that would be much more compassionate than the way that person would kill her.`
` ...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.`
` It does not toy with life and death.`
`...However, that person is different.`
` She kills over and over.`
` She kills for fun!`
` There is not even a trace of compassion there.`
` .........I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."`
`"......Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch. `
`......However, the new Beatrice-sama already views you as hostile, Milady.`
` ...If you were to be seen by her again, ......you would not have any way to escape this time, correct?"`
`".................................`
`......When I reunited George with Shannon,`
` .........I finally understood what a witch is,`
` and what magic is.`
`.........I am a witch.`
` I must be a witch.`
` And I must be acknowledged as Battler's opponent, ......and make Battler accept me as a witch this time around.`
`......The road to that goal may be long and difficult.`
` ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ......I cannot call myself a witch."`
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?`
` There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.`
` Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?"`
`"......Hmm.`
` ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica. `
`......Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.`
` ......If I can borrow the power of that emotion, my magical power may be able to knock on the doors of Hades once again."`
`"You may be able to knock.`
` However, you would use up all of your magical power.`
` ......If you were to be spotted by the new Beatrice-sama, you would truly be without a method of escape. `
`...I am no longer your butler, Milady.`
` ......Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."`
`"...I know.`
` .........By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.`
` ...So I may not be able to compensate except by saving the same number of lives through that door.`
`......I have nothing to lose in the first place.`
` ...I am just a gold butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer accepted as a witch."`
`".........What about Battler-sama?`
` You are part-way through a game with him.`
` He has said that he would wait until you returned, Milady. `
`...Is it alright if something happens to end it here?`
` ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler-sama, Milady."`
`"For that very reason...!`
` If there is a life that only I can save, I will save it. `
`And I will be accepted as a witch.`
` ......I must be a witch...!`
` If this is training, it is a very childish thing, unfitting for the evils I have committed until now.`
`......Go, hide yourself, Ronove.`
` Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a witch...!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` ......Please show me magic...`
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch. `
`......I pray that it is not your final magic."`
`"Go, my friend.`
` ...If there is enough ink, write down the story of my foolish life, and hand it over to some fool who is trying to walk down the same path. `
`Goodbye, Ronove...!"`
`"Kanon-kun, `
`......where are you..., `
`where are you......`
`...Help me, `
`......help me..., `
`...ooooooooohhhh..."`
`.........Milady.`
` I am always...waiting by your side.`
`"K, ......Kanon-kun......?`
` Kanon-kun......?!"`
`Jessica thought that she had just heard Kanon's voice.`
` She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, there was no way for her to see anything.`
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.`
`"......Kanon-kun, .........Kanon-kun......`
`...Help me, .........help me........."`
`Yes, Milady.`
` ...I will...help you.`
`"K, ......Kanon-kun...?!`
` Y, you were alive...?!"`
`This time, she thought that she had heard his voice clearly.`
` Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.`
`......Milady, please calm your heart and listen.`
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive.`
`".........Huh......?"`
`I have already...died.`
`......However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.`
`...Then, she gave me only a short period of time to help you, Milady.`
` Please, calm your heart even more.`
` If you do, ......my form will become visible even to you, Milady...`
` Jessica obeyed those words.`
` She chased all idle thoughts from her head, and relaxed her breathing.`
`......Her heart actually felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the person she had liked and thought was dead.`
` She resisted that with all of her strength.`
`......When she did, ......she felt as though Kanon-kun really was right in front of her.`
`......Even though she shouldn't have been able to see him with her eyes, ......she was able to sense him clearly.`
`"......Can you...see me?`
` Milady..."`
`"Yeah...`
` I can see, ......I can definitely see you, Kanon-kun..."`
`".........I exist only as spirit.`
` So I cannot touch you, Milady.`
` I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.`
` ......I am a weak existence which can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."`
`"......Just words, ......is it......?`
` I can't, ......touch you, Kanon-kun......?"`
`"I am now even more fragile than smoke from a candle.`
` ...So much so that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly. `
`......So please, don't try to touch me.`
` ...Because I am also, ......holding back my desire, ......to touch you, Milady."`
`"Ah, .........y, ...yeah..."`
`"More importantly, Milady.`
` ......Please listen well.`
` .........The new witch has a cruel heart.`
` ...She will surely make you meet with a horrible end.`
` ......You must escape from this room and hide."`
`"H, ...how...?`
` I can't...see anything......!"`
`"Quiet...`
`......I will be your eyes, Milady.`
` Please move in accordance with my instructions.`
` ......First, please crawl three steps from there, and then stand up.`
` You are now under the desk, Milady.`
` If you stand there, you'll hit your head."`
`"...Th, that was under the desk...?`
` I got it..., 1, 2, 3...`
`...I'm standing..."`
`"Well done......`
` Next, please turn to face towards 9 o'clock.`
` .........Yes, well done."`
`"Ha, ......haha...`
` This is pretty, ...embarrassing...`
`......Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."`
`"Are you alright? Does your wound hurt...?"`
`"N, no, ...I'm fine...`
` What next......?"`
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up.`
`...And, if she were allowed to, she would have wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.`
`...However, if she did that, maybe Kanon would vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...`
`......She was afraid of that.`
` So she satisfied herself with just listening to his words once more, `
`repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.`
` Therefore, what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.`
`......Tears of gratitude for the god, ...or else witch, who had given her this miraculous moment.`
`"...Is it alright...?`
` If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her?`
` Won't our voices be heard...?"`
`"......I have erected a barrier for privacy.`
` If you don't make any loud noises or speak noisily, no one will notice.`
` ......So no one can notice my presence."`
`"...I, ...I don't really get it, ...but anyways, we'll be fine as long as we stay quiet, right...?`
` ......Wh, what should I do next...?"`
`"Please walk 10 steps in that direction.`
` You will touch the sofa.`
` Please continue along that.`
` ......Do it slowly.`
` ......Stay calm.`
` Believe my words."`
`"S, ......sure.`
` ............Heheh, ...it's weird...`
`......Even though it's so scary not being able to see, .........if you're with me, Kanon-kun, it isn't scary at all..."`
`".........Yes, that is the sofa.`
` Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...`
` There is a table just to the left.`
` Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."`
`......It was a very, very strange and odd team effort.`
` Even though she would have been killed in an instant if she had been noticed by the terrible witch, `
`......Jessica's heart was not fearful.`
` She was being protected and guided by Kanon, who she had thought she would never be able to meet with again.`
`...Although it was probably only a momentary miracle.`
`......Even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for this miracle.`
` If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear, so she tried not to break this faint miracle.`
` And, trying to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity, she slowly, slowly, ...continued to walk, obeying Kanon's voice...`
`"......Alright, if you walk 10 more steps, you will exit the servant room.`
` Then, please turn to face 9 o'clock, and keep walking very slowly.`
` Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.`
` ...I will take you to a safe room."`
`"............If I go there, `
`...will you, `
`...come back, Kanon-kun......?"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon didn't answer.`
`...But his lack of an answer was enough to tell her the truth.`
`"......Then, ......no way.`
` .........I don't want to go..."`
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."`
`"That's alright...`
` If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......Milady,`
` please be reasonable.`
` ......For the dead such as myself, the human world is too bright and painful...`
` So I cannot stay for long.`
` So Milady, ......with the time I am allowed, ......please permit me to guide you to a safe place.`
` ............Because after that, .........I will stay with you until my time runs out."`
`".........Is that...the best you can do, Kanon-kun......?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........And in exchange, I will stay by your side as long as possible, Milady.`
` ......The whole time, ......I will talk with you, Milady."`
`"Talk, ...about what...?"`
`"............What do you want to talk about...?"`
`"...Anything that you could tell me about, Kanon-kun..."`
`"......Well then...`
`.........I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy without courage.`
` .........The story of a foolish and pitiful boy who felt love for a Lady as radiant as the sun, ...and even though those same feelings were confessed to him,`
` ......he lost to his cowardice, and in the end, was not able to be honest with his feelings while he still lived."`
`"............Yes...`
` Then, ...me too.`
` .........The story of a cowardly girl, ......who couldn't muster the courage,`
` ......to tell the boy she loved that she did love him, much, much more often.`
` ......And, ......the story of how that girl, after being given a miracle by god to be reunited with that boy,`
` .........used that chance to muster up her courage."`
`".........I also, ......want to hear that.`
` ......So, for that reason, let us go.`
` ......To a safe place."`
`"......Yeah...`
` If I could be with you, Kanon-kun, I would walk however long, however far...`
` I don't need eyes anymore.`
` If you tell me to step forward, I would even take a step off a cliff."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Well then, Milady.`
` Let us go.`
` The first 10 steps."`
`"No, I don't like it.`
` ............I won't do it, ...unless you call me Jessica."`
`"......Understood.`
` ..................Well then, Jessica.`
` ...Take the first 10 steps."`
`"Yes.`
` Kanon-kun......"`
`Very quietly, Jessica and Kanon slowly snuck out of the servant room.`
` Just around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down at Nanjo's corpse, `
`but the witch did not even notice their presence.`
` However, Ronove, who was waiting at her side, met Kanon's eyes.`
`...Kanon thought 'oh no', grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.`
`"........................"`
`However, Ronove did not inform his master.`
` As though he hadn't even found fault with Kanon being there in the first place, he pretended not to recognize him.`
`......No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.`
` From a finger on Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.`
` That went unnoticed by the master he served.`
` Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.`
` Because it was far more powerful than the privacy barrier Kanon had.`
`...He may not have known, but that power had originally been Ronove's.`
`...An imitation of that had been given to Kanon by Kinzo, and this is what Kanon was using now.`
` As that butterfly of privacy magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.`
`...It probably wouldn't last long.`
`......But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get far away from the cruel witch.`
`"Alright, Milady...`
` Let's follow that wall and keep walking.`
` ...Keep going.`
` Keep going."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......If I can be with you Kanon-kun, ......I'll keep on going, keep on going anywhere..."`
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,`
` ...the two who were separated by the wall between life and death slowly walked away towards the end of the corridor...`
`......There was no way that the evil witch would have magic to notice their flight.`
` Until they disappeared at the other end of the corridor, the witch did not notice that Jessica had vanished...`
` By the time the gold butterfly Ronove had sent flying evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.`
` Even though she would have been able to make it this far quickly if she had been able to see, as she was now, it had been a very long adventure.`
`"......Come on, Milady.`
` We've reached the parlor.`
` I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.`
` If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe."`
`"Inside the curtains...`
` Not bad.`
` I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."`
`".........Beatrice-sama..."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Kanon called the witch's name.`
` Jessica looked around in surprise, but she obviously couldn't find the witch when she couldn't see...`
` Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.`
` Kanon squared off against the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...and actually pitying.`
`"............I don't understand what you felt when you decided to revive me on some kind of whim."`
`"......It was nothing more than a whim.`
` ......No, ......this is how witches should be.`
` ...It took me one thousand years to notice that.`
` ...That is how...foolish it is."`
`"Wh, ...who?!`
` Who's there...?!"`
`"...Milady, be quiet.`
` ......She is the witch, ...Beatrice...`
`.........I am in her debt, ......because she let me be with you one more time."`
`"............The witch..., ......Beatrice......"`
`"...Forget about me.`
` More importantly, you should quickly hide that girl in the shadows of the curtains. `
`.........You probably do not have much time left.`
` You may spend it in a final conversation with Jessica.`
`...A secret meeting inside a bunch of curtains, ...what a clever idea, you two.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Uh, umm, ............thank you, Beatrice...!!`
` Thank you for letting be with Kanon-kun......!!"`
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.`
` Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato sniggered.`
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.`
` Evil witches have no need for tales of love.`
` Allow me to retreat."`
`"......Beatrice-sama...`
`...Thank you very much."`
`"Hmph...`
`.........No need to thank me.`
` You know that something like this isn't enough to compensate for all of the evil I have done."`
`"I give my gratitude to a good witch as a parting gift.`
` ...I don't care about what had happened before now, or what will happen in the future.`
` ......However, in this very moment,`
` ...you are without a doubt...a good witch."`
`"......You flatter me, furniture.`
` The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who doesn't betray your expectations. `
`......And with that, farewell."`
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door.`
` And mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.`
` The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.`
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.`
` However, until that final moment, they should be given the chance to speak with each other of their love.`
` The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.`
`......So that no one would be able to defile their time alone together until the final moment.`
` At that time, ...Beato noticed something.`
`......Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.`
`...The evil witch's furniture had sniffed this place out.`
`"............So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things...`
` To think that she doesn't even intend to allow the two young ones to speak to each other of their love...`
`......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"45, Data Received.`
` Target Comparison, Confirmed as the Predecessor Lady Beatrice.`
` Parlor Defensive Wall Analysis.`
` 72-Layered Multilayered Defensive Wall, Attack-Proof Barrier and Anti-Magic Armor.`
` Sniping into the parlor is impossible.`
` Data Link to 410."`
`"410, Data Received. Nihi! `
`Then we've just gotta **** the Predecessor-sama first nyeh.`
` Great Lady Beatrice, your Firing Permission!"`
`"Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.`
` There's something I want to ask that granny."`
`"410, Firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The Siesta Sisters' gold bow released a gold snake.`
`......It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, aiming for the parlor as it drew a soft, snake-like curved line trajectory, `
`...and pierced Beato's chest.`
`"..................Gwaah......!!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch showed herself along with her furniture.`
`"......Predecessor-sama.`
` Obstructions will not be permitted anymore."`
`"......Ugh......uu........., I didn't think they would be permitted...`
`......Still, the Siesta Sisters really have gotten rusty.`
` To think that they failed to bring me down.`
` ...And twice, at that...!"`
`Ronove spoke in a manner fitting for the witch's butler.`
` As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.`
`"My, my apologies, Predecessor-sama...!`
` We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"`
`"As soon as there's an order, we can pierce you at any time.`
` We can pierce a hole in your ears, a hole in your belly button, any hole you like.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake that had pierced Beatrice grew even longer, drawing a funnel-shaped helix and awaiting its next order.`
`...It was prepared to pierce a vital spot as soon as the evil witch told it to.`
`".........For what reason would someone like you, who is no less brutal than I, `
`make them avoid my vital areas?`
` New Beatrice...!!"`
`"I wanted to ask you.`
` ...I don't know what trick you used to escape, but we thought we took you out, right?`
` Why is it that even though you could have escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?`
` ......It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, riight?"`
`"......Well, ...who knows?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And just a second ago.`
` Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?`
` ...The more I hear, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil.`
` If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?`
` ......That's what I wanted to ask."`
`".........*cackle*cackle*!`
` Because I am brutal, I am fickle.`
` How could there be any meaning in asking that?"`
`"Siesta Sisters. Sew."`
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space,`
` moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey,`
` and pierced Beato's body multiple times from both sides, its gold tail drawing a x shape.`
` As the cruel witch had ordered, it drew a cross-stitch through Beato's chest.`
` The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...`
` Rather than a gold snake searching for its prey,`
` it waited for orders like a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.`
`"When it comes to you, there's no way it was a whim.`
` ......I've heard about you.`
` And I've learned.`
` You are such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet.`
` I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you.`
`......But you've always been in the way.`
` You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.`
` ......What changed you?`
` You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,`
` and I let you live to learn what happened to make you change so much."`
`"......If you want to know, then you should waste one thousand years.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Sew."`
`"Gwaahhhh!!!`
` Ackkah, ......gah!!"`
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross-stitch.`
` It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest.`
` The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.`
`".........You might actually be the type that disappears when they die and doesn't leave a corpse.`
` So I'll kill you slowly. `
`But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll kill you gently.`
` I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death perfect for my Predecessor-sama.`
` I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` ...And you still won't talk?`
` About the reason for your change of heart."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!!`
` Not answering what she is asked is also one of the pleasures of an evil witch."`
`"Sew. Twice."`
`"Gyoah, gwuaahh.........!!"`
`"Of course, you don't have to answer.`
` After all, that way I get to torture you. `
`Kuukuhihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`The Endless Magic truly is wonderful.`
` ...When you think about it, this world is limited in every way.`
` The endless cannot exist in the human world.`
` Because God is without limits, the human world is deprived of all limitlessness so that it can be looked down upon.`
`...So, in other words, the endless power is the power of God!`
` A wonderful power where the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!`
` You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!`
` Why are you having a change of heart only now?`
` You aren't gonna say that you regret it because you handed it over to me, right?"`
`"How could I regret it.`
` The Endless Magic is not magic as you believe it to be. `
`...True magic is in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."`
`"And you noticed that......?`
` What, ...is it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wander around for a thousand years without noticing that, you foolish witch."`
`"Sew. Three times this time."`
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...gu...!!!"`
`Beato's chest had been embroidered with the gold thread.`
` It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...`
`"......Well, that's fine.`
` It's no longer interesting whether or not some good-as-dead granny reached some deep understanding.`
` I'm bored now, so I'll kill you quickly.`
` If I kill you, the barrier to the parlor will dissolve.`
`......Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.`
` ......Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time, ......sounds fun right?`
` Kuhhihihhihhihihihhihihihihi!! `
`Kill her...!!!"`
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart...`
` That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.`
` Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over one thousand years...`
` But, .........she couldn't die.`
` She must not die.`
` If she died, the two in the parlor would be handed over to the cruel witch.`
` So she definitely couldn't die.`
` She resolutely...refused to die...!`
`".........New Beatrice...`
`...I have a request.`
` .........The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor is to be short.`
` .........In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably disappear to Hades.`
` ...Would you please allow them that much time...?"`
`"No waay.`
` Isn't tearing apart two who love each other fun?`
` You said it.`
` So I want to try it!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*...`
` In that case, I cannot allow you to enjoy that pleasure...`
` *cackle*cackle*, it is fun, tearing apart lovers."`
`"Really?`
` I'm sure it's fun, right? `
`So don't get in my way!! `
`Sew more!`
` Sew, sew, sew!!"`
`"Nihi!`
` 410, Understoo-d!!"`
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed the gold thread through Beato's heart over and over again.`
`......However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...`
`"Ku, ......ooooohh..., this isn't nearly enough...`
` I won't die by something like this...!!"`
`"What are you doing?`
` Make this granny stop talking.`
` Kill her quickly!"`
`"W, ...we're killing her...!!`
` Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times,`
` ......this person's heart, ...w, won't stop...!!"`
`"......Are you...immortal?"`
`"Of course not.`
` ......I've handed the endless over to you.`
` My heart will not beat many more times.`
`...However, if by making it beat just once more, I can give the two in this room a longer period of time, `
`......I'll continue that resistance for all eternity!!"`
`"Sew!! `
`Keep sewing until this person's heart stops moving!!"`
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh, ......why doesn't she die?!`
` This is impossible...!!"`
`"Even though her heart is, ......sewn in place..., `
`......why doesn't it stop?!"`
`"Then there's no problem, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...! `
`How pitiful, and you could have died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!"`
`As they said that, even though the gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again, Beato still didn't die...`
` The cruel witch eventually grew pale at how bizarre that was.`
`"............What in the world, ......are you...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You probably cannot understand.`
` ......Even I didn't understand.`
` ......But still.`
` ...Somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic. `
`.........In other words, `
`......I have now, `
`......become it.`
` ...I have become, `
`......a true witch!!"`

`"Explosion!!!"`
`There was a terrible sound, .........and gold leaf was scattered around the area, along with a group of gold butterflies.`
` Beato's chest had opened wide from the inside, `
`......and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf poured out, staining the surrounding area gold...`
` Then, Beato's flesh crumpled.`
` Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...crouching down, she crumpled.`
`......However, in the air, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated, and continued to beat...`
`".........Wh, .........what the, .........eeeeeek..."`
`"M, ......monster..., ...eeeeeeeeek...!"`
`When the Siesta Sisters saw that, they fell on their butts in shock.`
`......Somehow, ......even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating,`
` continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.`
`...It was an immeasurably immense magical power.`
`...Impossible to measure.`
` In other words, endless.`
`".........I, I'm the Endless Witch, right...?`
` .........Why is this granny, ......still alive, ......after all of this......?!! `
`Siesta Sisters!!`
` Smash that heart!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"I, it's impossible, my apologies!`
` We cannot do it!!"`
`"............It is probably impossible.`
` No amount of people could crush that heart.`
` ...Much less the likes of the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."`
`"In that case,`
` an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?`
` My power is a god's power!!"`
`"I am afraid to say, `
`that your power cannot`
`leave a single wound on Beatrice-sama's endless nature."`
`"......Just what, ...do you mean by that......?"`
`"In the same way that there is no light without knowledge of shadows,`
` ......there is also no endless without knowledge of the limited.`
` .........Before Milady Beatrice's true endless power, your frail magical power is very, very lacking."`
`"What is, .........that......`
`...aah-"`
`The cruel witch was surprised and stepped back.`
` It was thinner than a lace curtain.........But Beato's form, `
`...no, Beatrice's form was still standing there.`
` Even after being exposed so tragically like this, ......she didn't allow evil through that door.`
` At that time, ...a shadow just as thin as Beatrice stood behind her.`
` It was Kanon.`
`".........Beatrice-sama. `
`...Thank you very much.`
` ...I will not forget this favor you have done for me."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...I shall listen to those words again when the number of my favors surpasses the number of grievances I have caused.`
` ......Is that enough?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........Truly, thank you very much. `
`......And Beatrice-sama, `
`......you have also done enough.`
` ......Please, `
`......be at peace..."`
`"......Is that so?`
` ......Is this, ...enough......?`
` .........ha, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"What's going on...?`
` ...Why are you guys calling that predecessor granny Beatrice?! `
`Beatrice is my name, right?!`
` It should be my name, as the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"`
`"............How rude.`
` Do not fake Beatrice-sama's name."`
`"I am afraid to say,`
` ......that the name of Beatrice-sama should be taken by the person who can be crowned as the Endless Witch.`
` By now, the term predecessor refers to you.`
` ...Pukkukukukuku."`
`"What, ......did you say......?"`
`".........Farewell, Kanon. `
`......I'll meet you soon anyways.`
` In a new nightmare."`
`".........In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, Beatrice-sama...`
`......With that, ...if you would excuse me......"`
`Kanon's form grew faint, ......and he disappeared into thin air.`
` After watching him go, ...Beatrice's form also grew thin, ......and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.`
` Then, ......there was a *splat*.`
` The golden heart which had been floating in midair, ...lost its sparkle, became bloodstained flesh, and fell to the ground.`
`...How frail it was.`
` It was ragged and full of holes.`
`...But until just now, it had sparkled so much, and had continued to beat forcefully.`
` That heart still barely managed to beat.`
`......However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.`
` Beatrice, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,`
` ......steadily watching her own heart...`
` There, the cruel witch could be seen...`
`"...Wh, ...what do you mean, endless...?`
` Aren't you actually collapsed in a heap like this?! `
`The endless that is limited...that's a contradiction, it couldn't exist!`
` That is the limit of your magic!`
` The endless is better than the limited!!"`
`"........................"`
`Beatrice no longer had the will even to respond.`
`...No, on the contrary, it was doubtful that the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...`
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!`
` How's it going?`
` You can't stand, can you?! `
`Why do you think you can't stand?!`
` It's because you aren't the Endless Witch!!"`
`The cruel witch poked Beatrice's heart with her fingernail.`
` Beatrice had no words with which to respond to that provocation.`
`......However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.`
`......It looked humiliating only to the cruel witch.`
` Because she had gently curved her mouth, ......and smiled.`
`......Footsteps were approaching that place.`
` There was no way she had misheard it.`
` ...That rough squeaking of the heels was the sound of Battler's footsteps...`
`".........Battler, is it......... `
`.........Ha, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
`...After saying something so proud, ...I end up like this......"`
`"................................."`
`"............I've been trying to become, `
`......the true witch you talked about, `
`.........in my own way......"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......I was watching."`
`"......Hey, `
`......have I now, `
`.........been able to become, `
`......a witch......?`
` ......Have I earned, `
`......the qualifications to become your opponent......?"`
`"It's useless."`
`Battler said that unbelievably bluntly.`
` Taking a painful breath, Beatrice saw that, and sneered at herself as though she should have expected it.`
`"............Ha, ...*cackle*...`
`...Is that so.`
` ......The road to becoming a true witch will still be much more difficult...`
`......However, ...I will not surrender...`
`......Just like you never surrendered to my torture...`
`.........I will definitely, ......become a true witch,`
` ......and be......accepted as your opponent......"`
`"Yeah, it's useless.`
` It's all useless.`
` You aren't my opponent."`
`The cruel witch raised her foot high...`
`...Below it was Beatrice's frail heart.`
`"Die, granny!!`
` See if you can show how endless you are after you've been crushed to bits!!`
` I am a witch!`
` I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieee!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaah, it's useless, it's all useleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss!!!"`
`"Wha, .........what, `
`......is this......?`
` ...Wh, .........where is this......?"`
`"Get in your seat.`
` My opponent isn't Beato. `
`.........It's you."`
`"......B, ...Battler...?!`
` What kind of magic is this?! `
`Who cares, it doesn't matter!!`
` Siesta Sisters!!"`
`"45, understood, attacking everywhere!!"`
`"410, understood, die Battler!!"`
`The Siesta Sisters each readied their own golden bows, and fired golden arrows.`
` The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.`
` If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.`
` And their might did not change from what it normally was.`
`"Wha, .........i, i, it was deflected?!?!`
` There's no barrier, it was deflected with resistance alone...`
` F, 45, Target Measurement!!"`
`"45, understood...`
`............huh, ......whaaaa...?!`
` Th, this is, ......am I broken?`
` Am I insane......? `
`A, Anti-Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine...`
` E, even mythical-class magical attacks won't be effective on the target!!"`
`The warheads for the golden bows could penetrate any magical armor with their mutual corrosion.`
` When that was blocked by anti-magic resistance power, even something with eight digits wouldn't escape penetration.`
`...Furthermore, even among the resistance power of famous gods that appear in myths, there are not many who reach nine digits.`
` For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure almost all sensible values.`
`...Battler had buried all 9 of those digits with nines......`
`"......How foolish.`
` When Battler-sama is serious, magical arrows and the like aren't even enough to make his hair tremble."`
`The Siesta Sisters dropped their golden bow in shock...`
`...To this Battler, it was as though a pair of dragonflies had flown past his shoulder.`
`"............What the hell are you guys doing?`
` Are you playing or something?"`
`"...Eeeeeeek..., `
`...m, ......monster......"`
`"Stay back, small fries!!`
` Get in your seat, you fake witch!!`
` I'll tear that mask of yours off!!!"`
`""E, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!""`
`The Siesta Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they had been struck.`
` Beatrice watched this scene in shock......`
`"B, ......Battler, `
`......what, ......is this supposed to be......?"`
`"Just like you see.`
` My opponent isn't you. `
`It's her!!`
` The impostor over there, who's faking your name!!!"`
`"Ack...!"`
`"......I'm fighting with a witch.`
` ...An opponent who calls themselves a witch is set up, and I deny witches by crushing them.`
` ......I've had more than enough of your arrogance."`
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he stared at the cruel witch.`
`"......What do you mean, magic?`
` What do you mean, witches!?`
` You aren't a witch!!`
` I'll take that mask off and tear it to shreds!!`
` Virgilia, get ready to fight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready. `
`......Beatrice.`
` Stay back and rest."`
`"H, ...hmm......"`
`Beato looked at Battler timidly.`
`...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent.`
` Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?`
`"Beato, stay back and look!!`
` I'll tear it off!!`
` I'll thoroughly dismantle this fake witch!! `
`I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!!`
` You protected the honor of true witches!"`
`"Uh, ...I, umm......"`
`"You don't need to say anything. `
`On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!"`
`".........B, .........Battler..."`
`"Those are the general rules."`
`".........Thank you, Ronove.`
` I get most of the rules now. `
`...I see.`
` You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic.`
`......Foolish people.`
` Do you really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"`
`"Yeah, I do think so.`
` I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Eva oba-san!!"`
`"I, I am not Eva...!!`
` That is the name of the old shell that I shed.`
` I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"`
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh and blood human.`
` The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!`
` Virgilia, reconstruct the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood. `
`At the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.`
` We begin by applying the 'Eva culprit theory' for that case."`
`"Huuh?`
` Ridi-culous!`
` Come, arise, try to remember!`
` What kind of form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this supposed to be?"`
`"......It's summoning of the dead.`
` It is easy for a witch to bring even the dead to the stand for testimony..."`
`On the opposing side, a transparent Hideyoshi oji-san was summoned.`
`...Magic sure is convenient.`
` He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.`
`"Witness summons.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony.`
` Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"`
`"......I was taking care of Eva in the room the whole time.`
` Of course, Eva didn't leave the room."`
`"Eva oba-san.`
` Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap. `
`I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"`
`"Oh yeah, that's right.`
` Sure, say it in red!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}. `
`{p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}."`
`"See, look.`
` This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit, right?!`
` How will you counter this?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` That move's so lame, I could yawn. `
`......Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."`
`".........Battler..."`
`"Repeat it!!`
` 'Eva oba-san was also in the room for the entire time before and after the crime'!! `
`Hideyoshi oji-san was just there to create an alibi.`
` You made Oji-san stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.`
` ......If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"`
`"I, I refuse to repeat it...! `
`Hideyoshi's evidence is sufficient!!`
` There's no need to repeat that, right?!"`
`"......So you have stepped down.`
` Mercy is unnecessary.`
` This is check."`
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent is slow!! `
`Check!!`
` Maybe Hideyoshi oji-san didn't leave the room the whole time.`
` But saying that he was taking care of you the whole time...is a bright-red lie! `
`Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!`
` You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Rosa oba-san and Maria!`
` If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that 'Eva oba-san didn't take a step outside of the room'!!`
` You can't right?`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"Wh, .........what is that......?!`
` I, ......I don't get it...!!"`
`"Sorry, Oba-san.`
` ......Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played. `
`......Right, Beato?!"`
`"H, ...hmm..."`
`"The witch side resigns.`
` Let us continue on to the next game. `
`Next is the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."`
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to make a winning move, and she lost her composure in irritation.`
` She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on.`
`...However, I won't go easy on her at all.`
` Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go easy on her...!!`
`"Virgilia, next crime!`
` Let's reconstruct the case with Dad and the rest!!"`
`"Understood. `
`three people: Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, went to the mansion, and were killed there."`
`"My move won't change.`
` Eva oba-san, you are the culprit!! `
`This time, you don't even have an alibi from Hideyoshi oji-san!!`
` You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.`
` But that's not true!!`
` If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"`
`"......I refuse.`
` ...So tell me!`
` Eva is just a woman.`
` And the people who were killed were three adults holding two guns, right?`
` How did she kill them all by herself?`
` How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?`
` Like everyone keeps talking about, how is this stake-shooting device constructed?! `
`Explain that!!`
` As long as you can't explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi, `
`it doesn't mean that it was possible for Eva to commit murder!"`
`"I refuse to explain!! `
`It's a 'Devil's Proof'!`
` Just because it's impossible to explain, that doesn't deny the existence of an unknown murder technique, or maybe an unknown weapon!! `
`In short!!`
` Even if I can't explain how the stake-shooting device is constructed, that doesn't deny that it exists!!"`
`"Wh, what is that?!! `
`Could something that ridiculous work?!"`
`"......A 'Devil's Proof' is effective."`
`"Agreed.`
` A 'Devil's Proof' is effective. `
`......Battler-kun can claim that a stake-shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.`
` The witch side cannot object to this move."`
`"......N, not bad...`
` How pushy..."`
`"Heh!`
` Well, there's this ill-natured witch who trained me well. `
`This is check, okay?! `
`Try saying in red that Eva oba-san didn't take a step out of that room!! `
`That's right, you shouldn't be able to say it!`
` If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!"`
`"......Th, ......that's so irrational.........!`
` This is, ...messed up...!"`
`"Those are the rules of this game. `
`...How about some black tea first?`
` And some delicious cookies as well."`
`"I don't need all that!! `
`Oh, that pisses me off...!`
` So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!"`
`"Don't get irritated.`
` Drink some black tea or something.`
` I'll take mine straight. `
`What about you, Beato?"`
`"I, ...I am fine...`
`.........More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down.`
` Your opponent is only unfamiliar with the rules.`
` ...It will only really start once your opponent gets the gist of it..."`
`"But I'll crush her. `
`I'll thoroughly crush her. `
`That's because she isn't a witch.`
` If I accept her as a witch, ......all of your stubbornness counts for nothing!`
` I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use, `
`'cause I'll crush her with all of my heart and soul!!"`
`Battler's side then stuck with the 'Eva culprit theory' to explain Krauss and Natsuhi, `
`the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.`
` At the time, there had been no one on the first floor except for Eva and the victims.`
`...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.`
` At the time, Eva had claimed that they had disappeared while she went to the lavatory, `
`but nothing supported that, and the witch side couldn't repeat that in red either.`
` With the same argument as it had used to ask about the construction of the shooting machine, `
`the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself, `
`but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the 'Devil's Proof'.`
` Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,`
` having to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...`
`".........Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya... `
`Hah, I see!`
` I'm finally starting to get the knack of it.`
` I won't let you have things carry on as you wish any more! `
`This time, let me take the initiative.`
` Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!`
` Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!`
` ......For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi for the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`"......Wh, ...what is she thinking?`
` Why would she return once more to a situation she has lost?"`
`"I see...`
`...This is a rare attack, which you do not use.`
` Be careful."`
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.`
` They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day. `
`......However, in the end, three of them went out for food."`
`".........That's right.`
` In the end, three people went outside to get food."`
`"It's a pain, so I'll add in some red and say it. `
`{p:1:Kyrie was thinking that food was unnecessary}.`
` Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them, `
`{p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}.`
` And yet, she herself `
`{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}.`
` .........Isn't this a contradiction?"`
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.`
` There is a contradiction in Kyrie's pattern of behavior."`
`"That contradiction `
`'was created by me, using magic'!`
` In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic, and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"`
`"R, ridiculous!`
` There's no way that kind of magic exists!!"`
`"It's a 'Devil's Proof', right?!`
` Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't deny its existence!`
` And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.`
` And yet, you have even less room to counter this argument!! `
`.........*giggle*giggle*!`
` I wonder if it's alright to fight this way."`
`"Yes.`
` It is truly a spectacular move. `
`......Battler-sama, your response, if you please."`
`"You sure have brought in a weird argument.`
` ...So just what is it?"`
`"She has attacked your piece through Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior.`
` ...As has already been explained,`
` Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside and head to the mansion in order to get food. `
`And, even so, she took the initiative, `
`and took the contradictory action of going to get food.`
` As long as you cannot explain this contradiction, this violent move claims that it was due to magic."`
`"...Well, Kyrie-san probably thought that too in the beginning. `
`But she probably, uh, ...thought about various things midway, `
`and changed her mind, deciding that food really was necessary...`
` It would be a problem if, when things got tough, we had no energy due to hunger, ...and, well..."`
`"......She is claiming that this change of heart is due to magic.`
` In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart."`
`"Wh, ......what are you saying...?`
` ...You're talking about the inside of Kyrie-san's head, right...? `
`Can I also summon Kyrie-san's ghost and question her?!`
` Beato!`
` Can't you call Kyrie-san here or something?!"`
`"She cannot.`
` That is a move permitted only to the witch side."`
`"S, ......sorry..."`
`"......Aaaaaaahhh, fuck!! `
`She was probably, umm, ......thinking of us kids and, umm, ...on the whole, thought that food was necessary and..."`
`"You must make that claim objectively.`
` ...You require concrete proof that Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary for some specific reason.`
` ......For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."`
`"Too bad, `
`{p:1:the reason she changed her mind was not told to anyone, nor was it written down}!`
` Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind! `
`So it is impossible to explain!!`
` You don't have a single counter to my move!`
` Isn't it your turn to resign now, Battler-kuuun...?!?!"`
`"......It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.`
` And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."`
`"A detestably spectacular move.`
` .........If Battler-sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."`
`"Wh, ......what move is that...?"`
`"......Well,`
` I wonder what kind of move it could be.`
` I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember."`
`"...............Ku...`
` Quit being stingy and tell me...!"`
`"Beatrice.`
` There is no answer that will be given to those who stop thinking themselves.`
` ...Think.`
` Think in your own way!"`
`"Why don't you resign right now? `
`And I'll corner you even more with red. `
`{p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie preserved her pattern of behavior which states 'not going to get food=not going to the mansion'}! `
`And yet, she took the initiative and headed for the mansion.`
` She was pushing a cart, trying to carry food.`
` Why that contradiction?......`
` Because I controlled her with magic!!!`
` This is proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"`
`"............Shut the hell up...!! `
`A, ...are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!`
` ......The whole time until she died, Kyrie-san thought 'we don't need food', 'don't go to the mansion'?`
` Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!! `
`Are you saying that Kyrie-san was being controlled with magic?!`
` That's stupid...!!`
` How, ...how should I break through this magic?!`
`...If only Kyrie were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...`
` No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!`
` What should I do...?!!`
` There's no move that the human side can counter with!!"`
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, right?`
` Even if I lose in a lot of areas, if I can win in just one, that alone can display the existence of a witch."`
`"......In other words, Battler-kun has no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!`
` How truly funny that even though you thought you could corner me and call me Eva, `
`it's all been turned over by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie-san's head, right?!`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Just do it, resign!!`
` Why don't you accept it?`
` Why don't you lose?!"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit... `
`It's impossible for a human to show...`
` I can't do anything but guess what the dead were thinking when they acted.`
` Furthermore, I can't deny magic just by conjecture.`
` ...To break through magic, I need objective proof as to why Kyrie-san had a change of heart...`
`......But damn it, `
`it's been said in red that no proof exists as to why she wanted food...`
`......What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"`
`".........Battler-sama.`
` Is this...your resignation?"`
`".....................Ku.........`
` 'Not going to get food=not going to the mansion'.`
` But how should I understand Kyrie-san's thoughts, which actually do contradict......?!"`
`"You can't understand!!`
` It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!`
` That darkness is all of the witch! `
`Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, alright?!`
` You just can't deny witches!`
` After all, I exist like this.`
` I am the Golden Witch!!`
` I stole that name from the witch that used to be here!!`
` You can't deny that I am Beatrice!!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!`
` You have no right to say that name...! `
`......And yet, ......I can't think of a move to deny that.........!!!"`
`Battler could no longer counter this witch who was laughing insanely in triumph...`
` He didn't want to give up, but no move appeared.`
` He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.`
`......But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...!`
`"Battler-sama.`
` The time limit is over, so will you resign......?"`
`"Ku, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!"`
`".........The human side has no move in response.`
` It will res`
`"Wait! `
`......Th, there is, ......a counterattack."`
`"Wh, ......what did you say...?"`
`"Huh?!`
` What kind of move are you talking about, Predecessor-sama?!`
` Won't you tell me what kind of move can deny Beatrice's magic? `
`You can't, it's impossible!!"`
`"......If the proposition that 'not going to get food=not going to the mansion' cannot be explained by itself, `
`......I will explain it with the contrapositive. `
`In short, you can also explain it with 'she went to the mansion=there was a goal other than food'.`
`......R, rather than my specialty 'Hempel's Raven', ......this is Battler's specialty, 'chessboard thinking'.`
` ......If it is impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal, `
`we can only explain it with another goal which caused Kyrie to go outside anyways.`
` In other words, if we can establish that goal, we can defeat magic...!"`
`"I, I see...`
` So if she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, she had a different goal,`
` and said that she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal...`
`......C, ...certainly, it still may be possible to explain it that way.`
` ......But, ......how?!"`
`"Teacher, reconstruct the scene where Kyrie died...!`
` We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse should be the human side's right..."`
`"Yes, there is no problem.`
` I will construct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died. `
`We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here, `
`but by learning what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Fine, search as much as you want!! `
`There's no way you'll learn anything!`
` I just said it in red a short while ago. `
`{p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}!`
` No matter what you find, how could you understand anything!!"`
`".........We may find nothing...`
`......But, ......Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.`
` .........This is all that I can do......"`
`Beatrice landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,`
` approached Kyrie's corpse, and wandered around observing.`
`"R, right now, I don't know a single winning move using the human side's style of fighting...`
`.........Evidence was required, right...?`
` ......Then what should I search for?"`
`"Someone who was also the great Lady Beatrice is getting down on her knees and crawling around!`
` And she's even indecently searching a corpse? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*, that look suits you...!!"`
`"...Say whatever you wish...`
`......I cannot do any more than this...`
`......I do not care how I am despised...`
`.........However, I cannot throw Battler away, as he is fighting for my honor...`
`......Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh, `
`......I must answer to that responsibility..."`
`While Beato was bathed in the witch's sneers, she searched through Kyrie's corpse.`
`......She fished through the pockets, taking what was inside out and laying it on the floor...`
` Laid on the floor,`
` ......was a handkerchief,`
` tissue,`
` a key to her house,`
` the stub of a boat ticket,`
` a lighter,`
` a cigarette butt,`
` and a single hundred yen coin...`
` There was no special, suspicious object...`
` Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What's with that seedy looking trash?!`
` How do you think you can break my magic with that stuff?! `
`Worthless, worthless, are you a moron?!!`
` What's with this predicament, even though you stepped between us saying something brave?!`
` Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!`
` Why don't you just give up and die?!"`
`The witch fell over laughing, closing in on Beato.`
`...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.`
`"...Milady,`
` are you satisfied with your inspection?"`
`".........H, ......hmm...`
`...I will not find any more than this..."`
`"From this evidence, can some move be made to counter?`
` If not, then the human side must resign."`
`".....................Kuu........."`
`"Obviously, you don't have any room to argue back!!`
` I am a witch.`
` You cannot break through my magic!! `
`You're no longer anything but a former witch.`
` A loser who isn't even allowed to take the name Beatrice anymore!!`
` Come on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, just try to break my magic!!`
`...You can't, right?`
` You can't, can you?`
` Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that?`
` It's because I'm a witch.`
` ...Because you're just a loser without a name!! `
`Kuhhihhyahhyahhyahhyahhyah!!!"`
`".........Something, ............something should be here......`
`.........I won't lose heart...`
`......I will not lose heart......`
` No matter how much I am sneered at......, Battler is fighting for my honor, `
`......so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart........."`
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,`
` she tried to find if Kyrie was holding something else, ......to find something that could save Battler from his plight, `
`......searching earnestly.`
`...However, nothing more came up......`
`"............Damn it......`
`......Please, ......Ushiromiya Kyrie......`
` You must save your son from his plight...... `
`.........Please, ....after death, lend me power for his sake......"`
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer.`
`......It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.`
` No dead person existed that would answer Beato, who had lost the Endless Magic...`
`"It's pointless, pointless pointle~ss.`
` Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.`
` For you, who is neither a witch nor even a human, no one exists who will lend a hand!! `
`You will be alone for all eternity!!`
` You have no witch or human allies, and no one will save you!!`
` If that's frustrating, why don't you cry?!`
` Why don't you apologize, say 'I'm sorry I was useless'?! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"............Sorry, ...Battler.........`
`...I, ......couldn't help you, ...in any way......"`
`"........................`
`......No, that's enough.`
` ......Thanks, Beato.`
` I won't waste your efforts..."`
`"I, I don't need consoling...!`
` Just how could you argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!! `
`Just how could you strike back with this rubbish I scraped together until she sneered at me...?!"`
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.`
` And, ......after patting her on the shoulder in thanks, `
`......he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.`
`".........What are you trying to say with that trash...?"`
`"Kyrie-san doesn't smoke."`
`But Kyrie was also holding a lighter.`
` Certainly, she wasn't holding a box of cigarettes itself, `
`but at a glance, it naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...`
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie didn't.`
` ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes."`
`"Ha!`
` So what?`
` If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it isn't strange for her to be holding a cigarette. `
`Maybe she just picked up the cigarette butt of her husband who had bad smoking manners?`
` What are you trying to say?`
` What does this have to do with my magic?`
` Nothing at all!!!"`
`"I'll say more.`
` ...This is a different brand of cigarette than Dad smokes.`
` ......Sorry, Beato.`
` Could you look in the pockets of Dad's corpse too?"`
`"............H, ...hmm.`
` ......This...?"`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` The brand is different from the cigarette butt.`
` ...The cigarette butt Kyrie is holding is not of the same brand of the cigarettes that Rudolf smokes."`
`"And so what?`
` Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?`
` I wouldn't though!!"`
`"......Beato, sorry, but one more time please.`
` ...Hideyoshi oji-san's pockets.`
` .........In this family, only Dad and Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."`
`"I, ......it's here...!`
` Is this it......? `
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it out.`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."`
`"A, and so what?!!`
` How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!!"`
`"............That's right.`
` This cigarette butt is a message from Kyrie-san.`
` No, ......this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie-san left the guesthouse. `
`Beato, thank you.`
` ......If you hadn't found this, I would have given up here.`
`............Virgilia!!`
` Reconstruct the situation!`
` The guesthouse after it came to light that Rosa oba-san and Maria had been killed at the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood. `
`I will reconstruct it.`
` ......After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.`
` They constructed a barricade.`
` They rechecked that their defenses were solid."`
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all.`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Why are you bringing back the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"`
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him. `
`I can finally see why Kyrie-san went to all the trouble of putting a cigarette butt in her own pocket.`
`............It was because that cigarette butt meant something.`
` That cigarette butt was itself a message left by Kyrie-san for us...!!"`
`"I, I'll ask you this!!`
` How do you plan to deny me `
`with that single cigarette butt?!!"`
`"......As I've heard,`
` after the second twilight, an inspection was done for all the rooms in the guesthouse.`
` .........At that time, Kyrie-san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be."`
`"S, ......something that shouldn't exist...?`
` ......What do you mean by that?"`
`"It's this.`
` This cigarette butt. `
`This had been set in the ashtray of the guest room where Hideyoshi oji-san had been."`
`"Whaah?!?!`
` What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!`
` Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!"`
`"Eva oba-san hated smoking!! `
`There's no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when Oba-san was sick and sleeping!!! `
`However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.`
` When she saw that, Kyrie-san noticed immediately.`
` ......Hideyoshi oji-san was lying.`
` She noticed that Eva oba-san hadn't really been sleeping,`
` ...and that she had snuck out of the room!! `
`Repeat it!! `
`'This cigarette butt was crushed up in the ashtray of the room where Eva oba-san and Hideyoshi oji-san were resting!'"`
`".........I, ......I refuse...!"`
`"I've finally got it.........`
` Thank you, Beato."`
`"W, `
`......was I, `
`......of some, `
`...use...?"`
`"Yeah, you were!! `
`Peel it, we'll peel the mask off of the fake witch!!!"`
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake.`
` Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,`
` ...and during that time, he had been unable to withstand the tension and had smoked.`
` Then Kyrie had confessed that to Rudolf.`
` She had confessed that there was a good chance that Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.`
`".........Next, Kyrie-san proposed that they go to get food. `
`And then she asked Hideyoshi oji-san to lend a hand!!`
` This could only mean one thing.`
` Kyrie-san planned to isolate Hideyoshi oji-san and question him about the truth!!"`
`"'Hempel's Raven' is effective.`
` Unless the witch side assaults this move, the existence of the magic which claims to have controlled Kyrie is denied."`
`"Wh, what did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?! `
`I, I deny it, anyways, I deny it...!!`
` It wasn't me, noooo!`
` It wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in the room!!!"`
`"Then try saying it.`
` Yeah, you can't say it!`
` This time, you can't say it!! `
`Repeat it!!`
` 'At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room'!!"`
`"What the hell is thaaaaaaaat?! `
`I'm the one who was attacking, right?!`
` Why did I get on the side that's being attacked?!`
` When did offense and defense get reversed?! `
`I'm the one questioning you, right?!`
` The witch, me, whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"Again!!!!`
` Repeat it!! `
`'Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room'!! `
`There's no way you can say it, `
`it's checkmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!!"`
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?"`
`"......There cannot be one.`
` There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."`
`"You aren't qualified to call yourself a real witch!! `
`You aren't the Golden Witch! `
`You are a human! `
`Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh!!"`
`The witch howled.`
` Her entire body was burned with the tremendous heat that denied her own magic and existence, and she let out a howl like a dragon...`
` Her body flickered repeatedly, `
`flashing as though Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped.`
` However, that yell was sucked into the flicker, ...making it return to the original form of the cruel witch.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihhahhahahahaha...`
`...Alright.`
` ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then you can do that...`
`......That's right, I really can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.`
` ......I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch, `
`...and maybe I can now be called Ushiromiya Eva...`
`......But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic are denied!!`
` ...I'll teach you starting now...`
` I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a human, `
`......but a real witch...!!! `
`Look and see this red truth!!"`
`When the witch clapped her hands, time advanced in the world of the game board.`
` As they called Jessica's name, Battler and Eva ran to the front of the parlor.`
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was.`
`".........So, what's your point?`
` ......What are you trying to say?"`
`"Y, .........you couldn't be...`
`......Oh no......"`
`Beato went pale.`
`...That made it clear that the move the evil witch was trying to make was bad enough to make Beato go pale...`
`"This time, `
`......I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of.`
` ...No, I'll make this move against all humans who support you.`
` Listen carefully to my move."`
`"S, ......stop it..., that move is.........!"`
`"Beato, stay back...!!`
` I'll take it!`
` Come on, you fake witch!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:After Jessica was injured, `
`Eva was always under Battler's supervision.`
` Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice.`
` By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}."`
`"Wh, ......whaat............?"`
`"I'll seal you,`
` and humans as well, `
`......in a red barrier that most certainly cannot be escaped from.`
` Farewell, lowly humans.`
` Sleep for all eternity in a absolute closed room of magic with no exits.`
` ......Come on, listen carefully.`
` Listen to the red truth."`
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}.`
` Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.`
`...But if I say it this way, you could also suspect animal culprits.`
` It would be unbearable to hear an irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human.`
` So, I'll change it like this.`
`{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}.`
` That's how it is.`
` Next, I'll explain the situation for all 18 people who exist on this island.`
`{p:1:Kinzo is dead}.`
`{p:1:Krauss is dead}.`
`{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}.`
`{p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}.`
`{p:1:George is dead}.`
`{p:1:Rudolf is dead}.`
`{p:1:Kyrie is dead}.`
`{p:1:Rosa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Maria is dead}.`
`{p:1:Genji is dead}.`
`{p:1:Shannon is dead}.`
`{p:1:Kanon is dead}.`
`{p:1:Gohda is dead}.`
`{p:1:Kumasawa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Nanjo is dead}.`
`{p:1:The 15 people mentioned are dead}.`
` And.`
`{p:1:Battler is alive}.`
`{p:1:Eva is alive}.`
`{p:1:Jessica is alive}.`
` This is all 18 people!`
`"So you understand that accordingly, when the last victim, Nanjo, died, `
`only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"`
`".........Wh, ......what did you say...?`
` ......Y, ......you bitch, ...you couldn't mean............"`
`"`
`{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time. `
`So committing a crime was impossible for her. `
`Of course, Battler-kun isn't the culprit. `
`He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully. `
`"`
`No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious! `
`In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}."`
`"......And I know what you're thinking.`
` Your next move will be this, right? `
`There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!`
` But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}! `
`{p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo's murder}!! `
`{p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked. `
`It's impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!`
` And here's an extra. `
`{p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!"`
`"W, wait a second!!`
` Isn't that weird?!!`
` There are only three humans, then a murder occurs, ......and none of those three were involved? That's insane!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly. `
`{p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!!`
` In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors.`
` Get iiit?"`
`"No, umm, .........th, that's right!`
` What about multiple personalities...?!`
` Just like you were originally another personality of Eva oba-san's, `
`......let's say Jessica had another, witch-like personality,`
` which took the name of 'someone other than Jessica' and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"Moron.`
` I've already said it in red. `
`{p:1:Jessica's eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}! `
`No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!`
` I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way? `
`{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}! `
`{p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}.`
` In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it, `
`{p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!"`
`"Y, ...you've got to be kidding me!!!`
` I mean, everyone else is certainly dead, right?!! `
`Then......all that's left, ......is the 'Doctor Nanjo suicide theory', right?!`
` And the trap theory!`
` The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."`
`"{p:1:Nanjo was killed by another person}. `
`...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}. `
`{p:1:A weapon was readied, and he was killed with it from point-blank range in front of him! `
`The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him}...!!"`
`"But wait!! `
`There are only three survivors!`
` You said in red that everyone else is dead!`
` You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.`
` Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"`
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!`
` And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Why could a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!`
` Insane!!`
` You're lying!!`
` You're lying with the red letters!!!"`
`"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!!`
` Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"`
`"D, .........damn it............!!!"`
`"Right now, `
`I'll state it clearly.`
` ......The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.`
` A witch. `
`......The Golden Witch, who can't be explained by the 18 humans!!"`
`"V, Virgilia!`
` Ronove...!!`
` Isn't there a contradiction in this situation?!`
` Is she really telling the truth with red?!"`
`"......Yes.`
` The 'red truth' is effective."`
`"............What an, ......elaborate and precise cornering......"`
`"H, ......how should I make a move against her...?`
` Virgilia...!`
` Isn't there any move......?!"`
`"..................I, ...cannot think of anything..."`
`"...And you, Ronove?!"`
`"........................`
`.........My apologies.`
` ......However, in these last thousand years,`
` ...I have never seen, ......such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."`
`"............It is vexing, `
`...............but it is also beautiful.........`
`......What a, `
`......beautiful, `
`......checkmate made in red............"`
`The witch's teacher and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and an expression of ecstasy rose to their faces...`
`.........Forget surrendering, `
`...they were impressed at this perfect checkmate, `
`...which simply had to be admired...`
` When people accept defeat from the bottom of their heart...`
` It gives rise to neither regrets nor humiliation.`
`......Nothing is born except feelings of respect...`
` I, .........no longer knew, ......what was what anymore.`
` There were absolutely no weak points in her red.`
` She had said in red that all of 15 people had died.`
` She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.`
` In other words, no more than three people: me, Jessica, and Eva oba-san, existed.`
` And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
` And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo had been killed by another, murdered by 'that person' openly from in front of him...! `
`And she's saying that 'that person', ......is a witch.........?!!`
`"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort.`
` That has already been dealt with in red, right?`
` Everything other than humans are completely removed from consideration.`
` Even things like robots don't work.`
`{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}! `
`Therefore, I can also say this. `
`{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!`
`{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it!`
` Right before his eyes!`
`} However, the human may have been able to use magic.`
` ......Which means, it was a witch.`
`......That is, in other words, me.`
` The Golden Witch, Beatrice!!"`
`......Even as Battler, `
`...ground his teeth, `
`.........his knees hit the floor with a thunk.`
` His soul still refused to surrender...`
`......However, ...his knees had already, `
`...started to accept surrender......`
`"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi!`
` Oh, did you kneel...? `
`That's right, you're already starting to understand.`
` ......The Golden Witch does exist.`
` .........And that Golden Witch, Beatrice, is me...!!`
`"Come on, praise me.`
` Now, praise the resurrection of a true witch.`
` Now, praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!`
` At the ninth twilight, the Witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive......!!!"`
`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt.........`
`......I don't, ......understand......! `
`After, ...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,`
` ......I don't, ......have a clue anymore......!"`
`"B, ......Battler......`
` D, don't lose heart......`
`...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, right......?`
` Will you surrender here...?!`
` Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again......?!"`
`"I don't want to break that promise......`
`............However, ......I can't think of any move to deny her...!! `
`In the first place, ...this isn't even a problem!`
` Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!`
` I was told that they were innocent in red, right?!`
` And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear in front of Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him!`
` I give up...there's nothing I can do...!!!"`
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart......!`
` ......If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.`
` ...I'm begging you, don't lose heart...`
` ......I'm also cheering you on, ......so don't lose......!"`
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!!`
` I think that she's just a witch anyways, and must have done it with magic, so just thinking is pointless...! `
`It's useless, my head hurts, my brain's tired...`
` I'm thinking that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!"`
`"Battler, listen...`
`.........In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.`
` ......However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning, and advances with moves harmful to themselves, the game will end in the blink of an eye.`
` ......That is called a fool's mate."`
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, where losing as soon as possible is considered.`
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in.`
` Chess, in which the average playing time may stretch for several hours, can be resolved in a scant four moves.`
`......In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,`
` ...but if one side decides to lose, the game can be ended far too easily, at any time...`
`"......When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch, `
`and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic.`
`.........And it is the same way for the witch's side.`
` ...Witches use the red truth.`
` ......By using that, they can explain the true form of magic with humans, and immediately lose."`
`"............You don't have to tell me that...`
`......You're telling me to not stop thinking, right...?`
` However, `
`.........how should I counterattack that person's perfect bright-red move...?`
` For me, `
`......for humans, `
`.........it's no longer possible............"`
`".........Is it, `
`.........impossible...?`
` ......Is it, `
`......impossible for you, Battler......?`
` ......Please..., don't lose heart........."`
`"..................Sorry.........`
`...It's no longer, `
`.........possible for me........."`
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.`
`......Beato watched that with a distressed face...`
` Then she stood up, and spoke to the witch.`
`"............I will make a move as a counterattack to yours."`
`"Huh?`
` I wonder how you can cut up this perfect checkmate? `
`How can this checkmate, which is completely impossible for humans to break,`
` be broken by the likes of you?!"`
`".........B, Beatrice, you couldn't be..."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...If a human cannot make a move, `
`......I will assault you with a move I can use because I am a witch..."`
`"A move you can use because you are a witch......? `
`......Wh, ...what are you planning to do...?"`
`"I will use the red, `
`to deny witches."`
`"Beatrice...!!" `
`"M, Milady...!!"`
`The teacher and the butler were both startled.`
`......I also immediately understood what it meant.`
` To use the red that only witches could use.`
`...To use the red to deny witches.`
` It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.`
`"Wh, ............whaaat...?!`
` H, ......hey, what are you saying?`
` Deny witches with red...? `
`.........Q, ...quit talking like an idiot.`
` If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either......!!"`
`".........You are not a witch.`
` And I am not a witch either.`
` ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go...`
`.........Then that is convenient.`
` In this place now, witches did not exist from the beginning.`
` I will strip this deception away myself."`
`"Aren't both of us real, obvious witches?!!`
` Being able to use red is itself proof of witches! `
`I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you, `
`but if you mistakenly think that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then right now-"`
`"How could I be mistaken.`
` That is enough."`
`"Wh, .........what did you say......?"`
`"From the beginning, I was not able to become a witch.`
` ......I have done nothing more than finally begin walking on the road to becoming a true witch. `
`...If you were to say that I am a witch now, `
`...I would be nothing more than a false witch addicted to power, like you are.`
`......Rather than existing in that shabby form,`
` I shall erase this form of mine along with you, `
`without any regrets...!"`
`"A, ...are you insane?!?!`
` S, stop it...!`
` I still want to be a witch! I hate humans...!!"`
`".........Witch, please return to your seat.`
` Please, receive the human side's response from your seat."`
`"Wh, what are you doing?! `
`L, let go of me!! `
`Don't let that woman use red!! `
`Make her stop!!`
` Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.`
` And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders.`
` Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.`
`......That included demons such as Ronove.`
` However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,`
` ...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake.`
`"......Beatrice.`
` .........You have...no regrets, do you..."`
`"That's my line. `
`......Sorry.`
` ......Even though you taught me a lot of fun magic and magic of happiness, `
`.........I couldn't use it well at all.`
` ............So I'll study from zero, `
`...and start over again.`
` ...I am truly sorry, .........that you had to get caught up in your stupid disciple's misconduct."`
`"......I had a good disciple in the very end.`
` ......Go, while you still believe."`
`".........I, I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about...`
`...But I do understand one thing.`
` And I can say this...`
`......Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do, `
`...but stop trying to do it...!"`
`"You have no moves.`
` But I have one. `
`......If we let that move get away, she will be revived as a witch in the true sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.`
` ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,`
` and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's repeating delusions, for all eternity.`
`.........Can you permit that?`
` ...Is it alright for your dear relatives to be toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?"`
`"S, still, ......you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself...`
` Th, this is a game between me and her. `
`You shouldn't have to make your move and sacrifice yourself!`
` I, I'll think of something!`
` I'll surely think of a miracle move...!! `
`So don't rush into it!! `
`Ooooooooooooooohhhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit,`
` I'll definitely think of one, ......so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`".........This game is cruel.`
` The time limit for your consideration has already run out.`
` .........I am now the only one who can do it. `
`...Calm yourself, Battler.`
` ............I'll defeat her. `
`......I'll defeat that cruel witch with my own hands..."`
`"W, wait, Beato!!`
` Stop it, quit it!!`
` There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"`
`"Weren't you fighting to deny me?`
` ...What a strange person.`
` Hahahahahahahaha."`
`"......Let that child do as she likes.`
` And please, see her through."`
`"B, ...but......"`
`"Battler.`
` ......There's only one thing I ask. `
`......Would you, cover your ears?"`
`"My ears......?`
` Why...?"`
`".........Starting now, I will deny witches in red.`
` I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red. `
`......By doing that, `
`.........I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.`
` ......If you also hear the red truth I will tell, you will understand my true form.`
`.........If you alone cover your ears, the truth will not change at all.`
` ......However, `
`...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.`
` ..................I at least want to be a witch, ...in your eyes.`
` ......Please."`
`"......Beatrice-sama.`
` ...There is no problem on the witch side.`
` Please, your move."`
`"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`I won't let you get away with this either, okay?! `
`She's insane!!`
` Do you plan on dying and taking us with you?!`
` Stop it, don't deny it!! `
`Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"......How unsightly for a Golden Witch.`
` ............Alright, are you ready? `
`...I will remove your check in Battler's stead.`
` What happened on the chessboard where 15 people died, and only three remained?`
` ...Starting now, I will expose it in red.`
` With that red truth, ......I will pierce and kill both fake witches!"`
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.`
`......Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty,`
` would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.`
` And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...`
` Denying witches in red, ......was the same as knowing her shabby form.`
` Battler put both of his hands against his ears...`
`......To protect her final, `
`...honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.`
` And he howled.`
` So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.`
` After that, was a world where Battler could not hear anything.`
` Beato was saying something with red.`
` Even the evil witch covered her ears at those bitter contents.`
`......That was...the red truth.`
` Words of power.`
`......Words that denied her own existence.`
` Unique words that only witches could use, which denied witches.`
` Beato spoke.`
` With the red truth, she cut up the bright-red game board that the witch had released.`
` She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.`
` The 'truth' that Battler was not permitted to hear.`
` If Battler had broken his promise, and sneakily eavesdropped...`
`......In an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.`
`......She probably explained all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, closed rooms, spells, curses, legends,`
` ...and the entire tale of anger and sadness.`
` However, ......Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.`
` Yes.`
` ...From the beginning, ......Beatrice had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.`
` It was something that shouldn't be reached by being told it.`
` It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to with his own power.`
` A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center, and grew gradually stronger...`
` It was..., the power of truth.`
`.........Its heat and brilliance like the sun,`
` shone on all of the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.`
`"Gwoooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!! `
`Why?!`
` Why can you die?!`
` Why can you throw away your life, ...when you have such incredible power?!`
` You who hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything at will, `
`why can you so readily throw that away?!"`
`"......Learn that even with a mountain of gold, `
`even with magic to split the sea, `
`there are some things you can never obtain. `
`.........Come, show yourself.`
` Show your true form, ......Ushiromiya Eva!!!"`
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away...`
`......Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.`
`"Y, .........you are the culprit...`
` Eva oba-san......!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......, ahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Took you long enough to notice, Battler-kuun!!"`
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised the gun and pulled the trigger.`
`...An explosion could be heard, Battler's heart had been shot through, and he fell to the floor.`
` After going into convulsions for a short time, `
`...with blood dripping from his mouth, `
`...Battler died...`
` But in his last moments, he realized without a doubt that she was a murderer.`
` And not just for killing him...`
`.........There have been many murders, and I don't have a clue how they were carried out.`
` However, ......while my ears were covered, `
`......Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.`
`...In other words, .........even though I didn't understand it,`
` ......had that been nothing more or less than proof that magic can all be explained with humans?`
`.........Beato made me cover my ears.`
`...So I myself don't know the whole truth.`
`...However, .........now that it has been denied in red, `
`I know that one fact which is extremely unfair for us, ......that 'it is possible to deny all magic'.`
` So, in other words, ..................`
`......No, `
`......I must not think of that.`
`.........If I do, ...then the time I covered my ears would be made pointless.`
` If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.`
`...If, at that time, I had thought of some turnabout move to counter the witch's final move, `
`there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.`
` I, ......brought about this conclusion, ......because I was worthless...`
