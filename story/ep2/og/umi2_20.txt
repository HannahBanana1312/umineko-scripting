`"Well then.`
` ...Was the game just now`
` enjoyable?"`
`"......A game that one-sided goes beyond something worth seeing. It's boring."`
`"*cackle*cackle*. My, my, your point is harsh as always.`
` ......I was only bragging that this development was `
`compelling enough to satisfy even the boredom-hating Lady Bernkastel. What a harsh response."`
`"...Well, I'll accept that it was compelling.`
` ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.`
` You need the conditions to be a little more even-"`
`"......Are you saying that there's no way to win?`
` Even for Lady Bernkastel?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*."`
`"...............I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."`
`"There's no need to trick me.`
` I already know. `
`...That you aren't a bystander."`
`"....................."`
`"Were you planning on hiding it?`
` You're an outrageous person to come into someone else's territory from such a great distance and work against me.`
` You came to watch from the sidelines, and probably to push strongly for my defeat.`
` I've guessed right, haven't I...?"`
`"..................`
` And if so?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` Truly interesting! `
`That I should be granted a chance to fight with Lady Bernkastel, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady Lambdadelta, is truly a pleasure!!"`
`"......Yes.`
` I'm also pleased.`
` I really wanted to see you, brimming with confidence, fall apart and lose, so I came all this way."`
`"What an honest person.`
` *cackle*cackle*!! `
`Even so, it would be a shame if the contest between me and the great Lady Bernkastel`
` was resolved without at least one observer."`
`"..................`
`...You called her, didn't you.`
` That child."`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!`
` I found you, I've finally found you, Bernkastel!!"`
`"............How are you, Lambda?`
` Looks like you also have free time.`
` I wonder if it's fate that the pair who hate boredom should run into each other again...?"`
`"Stupid kid.`
` Why can't you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a problem of compatibility?`
` After that, you became such a braggart, and now you're even picking a fight with Beatrice? Shouldn't you learn your place?"`
`"*giggle*, Beatrice is strong.`
` And she's even more brutal than I am.`
` Just a little!"`
`"And by the way, don't just shorten someone else's name to Lambda!"`
`".........You're dumb too, Beato.`
` If this kid's in your game, she'll make a mess of everything."`
`"I really didn't just bring Lady Lambdadelta here to watch from the sidelines. `
`After informing me that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."`
`".....................You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!!`
` Because I'm the strongest witch in the universe.`
` But I lost to you so I'm not the strongest! `
`So anyone who is your enemy is my ally!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In that case,`
` with the great Lady Bernkastel as our opponent, it may not count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."`
`"............Do as you like.`
` ...Now that I've been exposed, allow me to get serious."`
`"That would be suitable.`
` 'Going easy' has never been written in my dictionary.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Lady Lambdadelta, let us enjoy our valuable relationship this time."`
`"Yes, I'll be counting on you, Lady Beatrice!`
` I've been terribly betrayed by her.`
` Unless the two of us smash her up and pay her back double, I won't be able to rest!!"`
`"............I'll be counting on you, Lambda.`
` And Beato.`
` ...No matter what issue we fight over, this will be a very significant battle for us."`
`"That's right.`
` Of course, I don't feel like losing, but who wins and who loses will be important."`
`"Anyways, we hate boredom."`
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.`
`"......That's right.`
` I should thank you, Beato.`
` It looks like I can finally escape boredom.`
` Do your best to entertain me.`
` Together with Lambdadelta."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"If we're decided, Beato, then let's start a strategy meeting right now!`
` I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'll teach you all of them!"`
`"And yet, Lady Lambdadelta, you were defeated by her, *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you! `
`Tsu-n!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha! `
`...She's never boring, that Lady Lambdadelta."`
`"............Isn't she?`
` Take care of her.`
` She's a lonely person."`
`"I see.`
` So she's one of 'those' that are popular these days.`
` *cackle*, as expected from Lady Lambdadelta.`
` Quite cutting edge.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Go already.`
` That child's waiting for you to chase after her."`
`"......Then, if you'll excuse me. `
`See you next game.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`......I'm sorry.`
` That troublesome one came, but don't mind it.`
` More importantly, `
`.........things sure got ugly.`
` I thought I'd experienced a very tragic end in Lambda's game, `
`.........but this time, ......it's exceptionally horrible.`
`...It isn't as though I don't understand that feeling which makes you hug your knees and close your heart.`
` If you meet that end several more times, `
`your heart will be killed without having to wait one hundred years.`
`......Beato saw through me, so I'll confess.`
` You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world.`
` Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented by a witch, in a manner of speaking.`
`...I am a witch who was born from there.`
`......So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.`
` So I decided that I'd lend you my power.`
` However, `
`............even compared to my fate, `
`......yours is...truly brutal.`
` Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.`
` But please, don't lose heart.`
` Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what.`
` Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair.`
` I've only been allowed a glimpse of the game board, `
`but the unfair and clever devices set up on the stage are so disgusting that they probably far surpass those of Lambdadelta's game board.`
` And what's even more frightening, is when that child moves a piece, it's not like she always makes the best possible move.`
` This is where she is very different from Lambda.`
` Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces to make the best possible move, in order to win.`
` But Beato sometimes intentionally cuts corners when she moves her pieces.`
` Since when we are in trouble, we try to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at their moves,`
` this creates a very formidable amount of noise in our information.`
` This could cause a troublesome amount of disorder.`
`......However, as in chess, `
`a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move.`
` In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero.`
` Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that.`
`......Even though those developments looked so overpowering, `
`...there actually was a weak point.`
` One that makes me want to take advantage of it.`
`......Even though I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.`
` Anyway, don't surrender.`
` Don't stop thinking.`
` Don't deny any possibility.`
` As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.`
` What's the most important element in defense during a witch's battle? `
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.`
`...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her.`
`......Making you accept witches.`
` There is no longer any doubt that this is one of Beatrice's victory conditions.`
` Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make as great an effort as possible to lend you my power.`
` Make an effort yourself as well.`
` If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.`
`......Umm, in times like this, what did I used to say again?`
`.........Umm, uh, `
`.........Fi, `
`...fight, `
`oh~.`
` Mii, `
`nipa~â˜†`
`............It's so embarrassing, doing this.`
`......I've done this much for you, so quickly stand back up.`
`"...Ah, there you are.`
` I wonder where Bern shrank off to?`
` *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"`
`Even so.`
` Just like usual, the pieces Bern chooses are pretty shabby.`
` It's the same with chess, right? `
`If all of your pieces were pawns, you would have zero chance to win, right? `
`If all of your pieces were rooks and bishops, you definitely wouldn't lose.`
`......W, well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could advance her pieces from anywhere she wants,`
` and then that idiot Bern, without taking notice of my compassion, started with a-ll of her pawns on my side of the board!! `
`What's up with that, that wasn't a loss or anything!!`
` Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy.`
` Because of that, I won't be able to rest until I see Bern's speechless face.`
` Because of that, and because someone like you is Bern's piece, I'm feeling just great! `
`And also, I'd really hate that girl even if I didn't lose,`
` so I'll definitely make her grind her teeth in regret, crying like a baby,`
` she's so lame, *giggle*, hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho! `
`C'mon, laugh with me, oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!`
`............Wait a sec.`
` Are you still hugging your knees? `
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious? `
`Could you be any more pathetic? `
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit.`
` I, the great Lady Lambdadelta, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,`
` will associate myself just a tiny bit with you and your hopeless chances at winning.`
` You should thank me.`
` You know, Beatrice may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me.`
` Why?`
` Because she's soft.`
` While that kid will frame the board so that she can win with just a few more moves, she will intentionally not corner you.`
` She'll do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things one-sided.`
` In short, you could say she has the bad habit of playing around by making it look like she's won.`
` Almost all of the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern,`
` look like utter waste and overkill to me.`
`...In other words, this means that she has a weakness, and you have a chance.`
` See?`
` She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right? `
`She is sometimes mistaken in her strategy and goals.`
` And she has too much bad fun.`
` As a result, she even makes and exposes her own weak points.`
` It's impossible for one of the strongest witches like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.`
` Why she lowers her own chances of winning.`
`.........But, well.`
` Because of that, the type of witch like Bern, who thoroughly reads her opponent, has a really bad affinity with her.`
` Because reading her doesn't work.`
`...Maybe it's really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me.`
` It makes me mad!`
`...Well, still, a super firepower type like me can flat out beat up a light, wide-range barrage type like Beatrice, `
`so it's kinda like rock-paper-scissors.`
` If I'm paper, Beato is rock.`
` Which means Bern is scissors.`
` Well, maybe that doesn't matter.`
` Even though my paper loses to Bern's scissors,`
` if it was super-paper, which is far more awesome than normal paper, it could even beat scissors, right?! `
`In other words, I, Lady Lambdadelta, `
`am super-paper!`
` Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho! `
`It looks like you regained a little of your complexion.`
` That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.`
` At a glance, you'd think she has a really bad habit, right?`
` Wrong.`
`......She's just killing time, hoping that you'll stand back up and return.`
` It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by intentionally doing something detestable.`
` Ah man, I hate kids like that! `
`Well then, I'll return.`
` Ah!`
` Don't tell anyone that I helped you out just a little bit! `
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?! `
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern! `
`So I have to take that seat back from Bern,`
` but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!`
`...Well, I'm not really complaining.`
` It would be easier to steal it back from Beato, but then I wouldn't be satisfied, you see?! `
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest! `
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?! `
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!`
