`The biggest event for the Ushiromiya family in fall was the family conference in October, `
`but to Jessica, there was another one before that: the school cultural festival.`
` Jessica liked school. To her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up during the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.`
` For the cultural festival today, she had formed a group with her friends, `
`and had announced that they would perform light music on a temporary stage.`
` She had kept on preparing and practicing for that, and had really looked forward to today, `
`.........but there was one thing that had worried her.`
` She looked at the clock.`
`...There was still a little time, ...but she was uneasy.`
` Would that person really come? `
`After taking a single deep breath, her heart jumped when all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.`
`"No wa-y, Hina's boyfriend's so a~wesome!!" `
`"Isn't he?! `
`Isn't he?!" `
`"I heard Rin's boyfriend's re-ally smart! `
`Is it true that guy's a glasses beast?!" `
`"No way, no way, my husband'll be a pretty bo-y!" `
`"""Kyakkya♪ Kyakkya♪"""`
`......None of the girls would say it, `
`...but to them, the cultural festival at Jessica's school was really a boyfriend exhibition.`
` Jessica didn't have a boyfriend.`
` She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no special 'only one'.`
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone thought it would be natural for her to have a fitting partner.`
` Furthermore, her pride had caused her to act like that was the case.`
` So she had slyly been able to trick them somehow until this year.`
`......But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival...`
`"Jessie~.`
` Is your boyfriend he~re?"`
`"Wha?! `
`Ah, uh, no, looks like he's not here yet.`
` Is he busy at work?`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"What kind of person is your boyfriend, Jessie? `
`At least give us a hint. `
`What kind of relationship? `
`What kind of relationship?!" `
`"Awesome, he's a working man, right?! `
`Will he come in a suit?! `
`Of course he'll be wearing glasses, right?! `
`Kyaa-!!" `
`"Heeeeeey, he doesn't really exist, does he? `
`If you come clean now, we'll let you join us! `
`Let's cry together during this cultural festivaaaal!"`
`"No no no, he exists he exists he exists, I told you, he really exists..., `
`ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`Jessica's bitter smile was covered with cold sweat.`
`...It was starting to seem doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp-witted friends...`
`"Yes.`
` Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"`
`"F, f, fake?!`
` Wh, who......?!`
` I can't think of...anyone!"`
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica into hysterics.`
` Even so, it was probably more realistic than the unrealistic methods running through her head about getting a boyfriend in the big rush before the cultural festival.`
`"For example, `
`......what about Kanon-kun?"`
`"K K, Kanon-kuuuuuun?!`
` N, n, no way, no way!!`
` Anyway, I'm sure Kanon-kun has work on the day of the festival..., `
`and I don't want to bother him..."`
`"Of course, I've fully checked the schedule.`
` Kanon-kun has that day off."`
`"......Wh, ...why are you always so clever at times like this... `
`No, wait!`
` It'd be even worse if he's off...`
` I can't pull him away from his precious break just for my own vanity!"`
`"If you don't pull Kanon-kun away, he'll always be shut away by himself,`
` so I think it would be perfect if you could forcibly pull him away."`
`"Y, y, `
`......you think so? `
`...No, `
`but, `
`...I'd feel bad for Kanon-kun......"`
`"Then try everything else...`
` How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?"`
`"...That may cause you to feel ashamed, `
`but you would only have to endure for the short and yet loooong time before graduation.`
` To a pair of lovers, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex☆"`
`"Sh, Shannonnnn~!! `
`You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you, you're teasing me, riiiight?!!"`
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.`
` But Shannon was unconcerned, laughing with her usual smile.`
`"Yes,`
` this is to get you back for making fun of me and George-sama all the time."`
`Listening to Shannon's comeback, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica hugged her cushion and rolled around on her bed, pretending to faint in agony.`
` She was so frustrated that she couldn't stand Shannon's smile, which looked so triumphant, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.`
` She could choke herself to death with her cushion later.`
`"Isn't it alright, Milady?`
` It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon-kun."`
`"No, that may be true, but, `
`no, no, no, no......!!"`
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite pillow to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.`
` And she grumpily chewed the fingernail on her thumb.`
`...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.`
` Shannon and Jessica were of about the same age, of the same sex, and they were also friends.`
` And they were both right in the middle of puberty.`
` They could never talk enough about things related to love.`
` That's why they were able to expose these topics to each other.`
` So Jessica had heard the details of how Shannon's and George's love was progressing,`
` and on the other side, Shannon had heard the details of what type Jessica liked, and what kind of man she might be interested in.`
` Judging by Jessica's reaction, maybe it had been unrefined to speak of that in detail...`
` She had said that because the discussion wouldn't progress if Jessica kept rolling around on the bed.`
` Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he had shown up.`
` There were almost no young men on Rokkenjima.`
` So maybe it was natural for Jessica, as a girl in puberty, to become interested in Kanon.`
` But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romance of a maiden's pure heart and love at first sight.`
` Shannon had been with Kanon the whole time at the orphanage, so she had known him before they had started working.`
` So Jessica had asked persistently about what his hobbies were, what his favorite food was, what type of girl he liked.`
`.........It was clear to Shannon that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.`
`"Come on.`
` ...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon-kun on a date?"`
`"B, b, but but but, ...Kanon-kun might also have someone he likes, so...`
` wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"`
`"For people that aren't honest, like you, Milady, `
`...what was that word again, I learned it from George-sama. `
`That's right, weren't they called '{c:86EF9C:tsundora}'?`
` Sounds like it will become popular after a few decades, doesn't it?"`
`"Wo-w, George nii-san sure is incredible...`
` so, he's capable of foreseeing future trends now, is he?`
` Awesome. `
`......No, wait!`
` Are you saying I'm living in the wrong time period?! `
`Waah, waah, waah, I give u-p!!"`
`......It took several days of fruitless efforts, but in the end, Jessica agreed to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend......`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Did you call me?"`
`Jessica regretted calling out at such a bad time.`
`...Kanon always had a sour look, but he had some bad days and some good days.`
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the former.`
`"N, n, no, umm, well, `
`............errr."`
`"..............."`
`All that confidence and effort she had piled up by practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...`
` Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.`
` When he saw that, Kanon took a deep breath.`
`...Jessica thought he had been shocked, and her face went pale.`
`".........I heard from Shannon.`
` This is about having me go with you to the school cultural festival, right, Milady?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, aaaaaaahhh!! `
`Nice, Shannon, `
`...yeah right! `
`Y, yeah, yeah.`
` Th, that's right, but, umm, err!`
` ............D, d, do you have any plans that day...?"`
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.`
` I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand, `
`but I hear it's a place where girls feel very ashamed if they don't have a boy with them.`
` ...And I was particularly ordered that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family not be in any way inferior to common people."`
`"Waha, `
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death late----r!!!"`
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice, and a broken smile, like a tea kettle filled with boiling water.`
` As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.`
` Kanon wasn't an idiot either.`
` He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.`
`......However, it would be really annoying to go along with the lady's game of love.`
` But Shannon had talked to him persistently.`
` He was very indebted to her.`
` He couldn't refuse.`
`...And that brooch was in his pocket.`
` Couldn't this strange turn of events also have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?`
`............Ridiculous.`
` But he remembered those words Shannon had told him.`
`...Had Shannon seen something that could not be seen by him? `
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings.`
` I am furniture.`
` ...As if I could, become something more than that.`
` It was a truly odd exchange between Jessica, who was still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, who took a deep breath...`
`"Jessie, someone's here!!`
` Didn't you hear?!"`
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!`
` Wh, who...?"`
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard to describe expressions, whispering to each other!`
` in small voices that weren't small anymore.`
` Even I feel kind of shameless.`
` Did I just say 'sorry, who'?!`
` Like I don't know who's shown up...!`
` Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless, it's useless, my mind is blank...`
`"No way, that's Jessie's boyfriend?! `
`So cuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!" `
`"She really had a boyfriend?! `
`No way, seriously?!" `
`"Jessica, you traitor!! `
`Isn't that really awesome?!!" `
`"He's younger?! `
`I never heard he was younger?!" `
`"Where where?! `
`Where where where's Jessie's boyfriend?!" `
`"She really does like young boys!!"`
`"He, h, h, h, hey!`
` A, aren't you late, wahahahahaha!"`
`"......I didn't know where the entrance was.`
` I apologize for being late."`
`"R, right, umm, ...that outfit suits you, doesn't it?`
` Wahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Shannon...said normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this yesterday.`
` It probably doesn't fit me..."`
`"Wa, wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true!`
` Shannon, when I get back I'll promote you two leveeeeeeeels!!"`
`".........This place is kinda filled with girls. It's uncomfortable."`
`"Y, y, yeah, isn't it?!`
` C, come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, alright?`
` 'Cause it'll be my turn really soon!`
` Come on come on come on!!"`
`Jessica was just as uncomfortable.`
` It looked like it was hard to be bathed in everyone's interested gazes.`
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought that he might have made things difficult for her by coming.`
`"......I get the feeling that I'm getting in the way.`
` Am I a burden?"`
`"I, I, I told you, no way!!"`
`"...Please tell me at any time if I am in the way..."`
`((Kya-, no wa--y, he calls himself 'boku'!!!!))`
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, you, you, you aren't a burden, Kanon-kun!!"`
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend 'kun'!!!)))`
`"......What should I do, Milady?"`
`((((No waaaaay, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler {c:86EF9C:omgomg}!!))))`
`"Nooooooooo, don't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"`
`".........R, ...really?`
` Understood, Jessica-sama."`
`(((((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her 'sama'!!)))))`
`"S s s, sorry, Kanon-kun, just for three seconds, could you close your eyes..."`
`((((((Hiiyaaaaaaa, kiss, it's a kiss, she's going to kiss him!!))))))`
`"S, ...sure."`
`*bang*, `
`*thunk*! `
`*bam*bam*, `
`*slam*, `
`*crash*!!`
`...When Kanon opened his eyes, for some reason, there was a horrible tragedy in the room.`
` Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.`
` Jessica put her brass knuckles in her pocket before Kanon opened his eyes.`
`"A, anyway, let's go over to the stage.`
` Our turn is coming up soon, so wait in a seat for bit. `
`'Cause we have to get ready!`
` If you go straight to the end here, there'll be a temporary stage, so you'll know where to go. Please wait there!"`
`She pushed Kanon's back, as it looked like it would be hard for him to go by himself, and chased him out.`
` Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and panic, which he had never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.`
` After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.`
`"There you go, you saw, right?`
` Did you see, are you satisfied?! `
`Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"`
`"......Ugugugugugugu, I lost the bet."`
`"I was sure that Jessie didn't have a boyfriend."`
`"That wasn't a boyfriend, right, she's just harassing one of her servants, right?"`
`"Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!"`
`"Sh, sh, shut up!!`
` Come on, let's get ready!!"`
`When Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, everyone energetically returned to their tasks.`
`"............Haah."`
`When Kanon went down the corridor as Jessica had told him to, he ran into a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.`
` It was probably being rented by the hour by some group or circle.`
` Groups from the school where singing songs, but the place was already getting excited.`
` Disliking that clatter, he approached a dark wall alone.`
`......So this is what they call high school.`
` It sure is noisy.`
` ...That's what Kanon thought.`
` Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before.`
`......Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.`
` To him, the greatest virtue for people was to always be composed and intellectual.`
` In that sense, it was very hard for Kanon to get used to the atmosphere in a school cultural festival.`
`...He had the responsibility to report everything he saw and heard to the Master.`
`...So he also had to report about how Jessica had acted without restraint earlier.`
`......At the very least, it was not fitting for the daughter of the Ushiromiya family.`
` The Master, Krauss-sama,`
` ...and especially Natsuhi-sama would probably be angry.`
` If I am to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?`
`".........What was all that?`
` ......So stupid."`
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier, and sighed again.`
` He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now.`
`......Come to think of it, Natsuhi-sama, as the president of the PTA, should have gone to an informal gathering after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.`
` Hadn't she said that she wouldn't be there to see Milady's event?`
` ......That was probably for the best.`
`".........Crowds are unpleasant.`
` ...What in the world is going on?"`
`Several female students keep glancing at me.`
` It seems they're all whispering the same things that Milady's school friends had said, and it's really unpleasant.`
` Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me?`
`......If you walk alone at something like a school festival,`
` you better watch out because a lot of strange people will come and talk to you.`
`"H, hello~, are you by yourself?"`
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me.`
` Their stares started to make my back tingle.`
`......Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?`
` ...Ummm.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I'm with someone."`
`"Uh, oh, really...?!`
` I, I'm sorry!"`
`Ah, it worked.`
` Instant reaction...`
` Well, that got them to go away, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me.`
`"No, it's that kid, Jessie's boyfriend!!"`
`"No way?! `
`That kid is?!"`
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!"`
`"Isn't he cu-te, he's younger?! `
`How nice!!"`
`"............Haah."`
`...There's no way I'll ever come to a place like this again.`
` Kanon sighed for about the zillionth time that day.`
` When he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
` When he looked around, he realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.`
` And unlike earlier, they were all guys.`
` With this huge crowd, he couldn't even see the stage.`
` Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, and he tried using that as a footstool.`
` When he did, he realized that there was now a new group on the stage.`
` The leader is Milady.`
` She's changed into stage clothes, and she's even holding a guitar.`
`......I didn't know she could play.`
` No, maybe she could play.`
` I have seen her practicing air guitar before.`
` Natsuhi-sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
` Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi-sama's prying eyes.`
` It really is for the best that Natsuhi-sama didn't come.`
`...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi-sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be dejected...`
`"""Jessie-samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""`
`"Everyone, thaaaaaaaaaanks for gathering here today!!"`
`I could hear Jessica-sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie-sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
` The students in the audience had kept calling out that name.`
`...I'm a little offended at this inferior name. It is inappropriate for Milady.`
` Jessica-sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie-sama.`
`...Everyone was probably a fan.`
` Her mike performance responded to that and grew more excited.`
`...It was almost like a song program on TV.`
`............At first, he thought it was superficial, but that feeling had changed into appreciation. It was pretty incredible.`
` Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.`
`...So to Kanon, the song Jessica sang was, how should you say it, `
`............very highly colored.`
` An any case, if Natsuhi-sama heard it, she would probably faint.`
` But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
` The die-hard fans who had even brought pen-lights sang along, `
`dancing crazily with the same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
` On the stage, Jessica-sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`.........He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.`
`"""Jessie-samaaaaaaaa!! `
`Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`"Again, today, behind me, the sound of footsteps! Oyashiro-sama is stalking! Curses, disappearances, sacrifices, torture, Onikakushi, do you eat it?! Don't say {c:86EF9C:Marisaaaaaaaaaaaaa}!!!"`
`...I must not go along with it, but...`
`......Anyway, Milady is full of life and looks like she's having a great time.`
` As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought.`
` Isn't this Ushiromiya Jessica's true form?`
`...Don't I know best that during her life on Rokkenjima, she'd had no choice but to kill her sense of self? `
`Then the time she spent, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family, `
`but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must have been very important to her.`
`...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was only limited to one side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.`
`......We are furniture.`
` We serve on Rokkenjima, and end our lives on Rokkenjima.`
`...So I had come to think that Rokkenjima itself was our whole world, as though, like in Ptolemaic theory, `
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.`
` But when I look at Milady like this, I realize that this is a horribly narrow outlook.`
`...I still can't go along with the excitement of the crowd.`
`...But I feel like I can see something that 'cannot be seen' on Rokkenjima.`
`.........I don't know if this is the unseeable thing Shannon was talking about...`
` But I still can't see the ocean as blue...`
`"Wasn't today the cultural festival at Jessica's school?`
` ...Was the principal doing well?"`
`"...Yes, he seemed to be in good health.`
` That's right, Member Takamiya also came.`
` She said to leave it to her."`
`"Hmm, busy as usual?"`
`"It appeared so.`
` That person is also very energetic.`
` That's right, then, I think President Emoto also came."`
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner.`
` School events often became social gatherings for local volunteers.`
` It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were celebrities around here.`
` By remembering the names of the important people at the informal gathering, Natsuhi told Krauss the news.`
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion, and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.`
`"......Milady.`
` Are those manners appropriate?"`
`"............Yeah yeah, sorry 'bout that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I am always telling you watch your language."`
`"......Yes."`
`Jessica answered, discouraged.`
` When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and interrupted his conversation with Natsuhi.`
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, `
`......well, okay!"`
`"I was watching.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Huh, ......huh?! `
`Ah, ......ahahahaha, w, well!"`
`Jessica's face turned bright red.`
`...She probably hadn't thought that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on the stage.`
` She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.`
` Actually, she hadn't wanted her mother to watch because she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.`
`......But it wasn't as though it didn't make her happy to hear her parent say that she did a good job after watching her try her best...`
`"Jessica appeared with both composure and dignity.`
` Fitting behavior for the students' representative."`
`"...ah, `
`............oh, `
`...yeah."`
`The smile that had been there until a second ago crumbled like sand.`
`...Jessica immediately realized that she was talking about something different.`
` Jessica was also the school's student president.`
`...She had no interest in something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy so she had grudgingly accepted.`
` Unfortunately, she was popular in school, so she had won the election easily.`
` So Natsuhi was praising her for the student council sponsorship ceremony at the beginning of the cultural festival.`
` Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.`
` She had immediately met up with her friends, and had held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...`
`"The experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will surely be useful in the future.`
` I am sure that Jessica will mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"But you spoke the greeting a little quickly.`
` You passed on content, but your fast style of speech was lacking.`
` It would be good if you developed a habit of taking a breath every once in a while."`
`"........., ...yeah."`
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room.`
` You could say that her room was the place where her parents had ordered her to be.`
` So maybe you could say that for Jessica, instead of returning to her own room, `
`being in an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...`
` Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.`
`"............`
`...Well, if she had been talking about that, I'm sure she'd have said something about how it wasn't appropriate for the successor to the Ushiromiya family.`
` ...So isn't it alright this way?`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.`
`...She laughed at what kind of words she would have had to receive to be satisfied.`
`......It was ridiculous.`
` In the end, I was just acting like a kid.`
` I'm a little surprised, and it makes me want to laugh.`
`"......Milady."`
`"Wa, ...Kanon-kun.`
` D, don't scare me like that, hahaha...! `
`*cough*cough*!"`
`Just as she had tried to force a laugh, Kanon had suddenly started talking to her, and she choked.`
`"What?`
` Something to say...?"`
`"..............., `
`umm."`
`"......Yes?"`
`Jessica's expression became the one she always had when looking at Kanon.`
` The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.`
` If he had still only known of Jessica as the successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he had until yesterday,`
` ...he would have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal.`
`......But that was wrong.`
` He now knew a part of her that he could not have seen until yesterday, so he understood that there was no way that, on the inside, Jessica was just as she appeared.`
`"Ah..., about today's cultural festival, `
`...well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.`
` You really helped."`
`"......That song.`
` ...You were good."`
`"Wha?! `
`......Ah, `
`.........ahahahahahaha?! `
`R, really, I'm embarrassed..."`
`Even though she had heard the words she had most wanted to hear,`
` Jessica acted shyly, and couldn't accept them seriously.`
`"......I cannot sing.`
` And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.`
` ...So I had just assumed that Milady was the same."`
`...Kanon hadn't planned on looking down on Jessica that much.`
` But people playing unique instruments were always on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.`
`...At the very least, he had been under the impression that it would be impossible for Jessica.`
`"...I am furniture.`
` ...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing songs or play instruments."`
`But, `
`......I'm not sure anymore.`
`"......Seriously, Kanon-kun, `
`enough with that phrase 'because I am furniture'...`
` That's some kind of understanding amongst the servants, right...?`
` That thing about servants being living furniture.`
` ...Genji-san says it a lot."`
`"It isn't an understanding......`
`...Because we really are, ...furniture."`
`"I know that the kids from the Fukuin House, ...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways,`
` and I realize that you feel gratitude for that. `
`......But that doesn't mean, ...you should call yourself furniture.`
` Aren't you a human like us?"`
`".................."`
`"Kanon-kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"`
`"......It looked like you were having a lot of fun."`
`"That's probably wrong."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It didn't look like I was having fun, `
`...you were jealous, weren't you?"`
`"............, `
`that isn't......"`
`Even Kanon himself probably hadn't noticed that emotion.`
`......Kanon had probably seen something he had never seen before, known about it...and been jealous.`
` And to trick himself about that emotion, he had called himself furniture over and over...`
`"I know I'm the successor to the Ushiromiya family or something,`
` ......and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do from now on.`
` As far as that goes, I can't do anything but give up, since I was born under an unlucky star."`
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Fukuin House, I don't have a choice either.`
` I couldn't choose the stars under which I was born."`
`"............That may be true."`
`"But there's one place where you and I are completely different.`
` ...Know what that is?"`
`I am furniture, and Milady is not.`
` ......He was about to say that, but stopped.`
`"...I do not know."`
`"Kanon-kun, you think that your own fate is everything and you gave up.`
` I can't accept this kind of fate, so I do the best I can. `
`......So in addition to the constrained part of me that must act as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`I've created another part of me that can do everything I like."`
`".........Another part, of yourself."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kanon-kun, you've been instructed to say 'because I am furniture'.`
` ......I'm sure there's been many things that have been tough just because you've been instructed that way.`
` ...I think that's, `
`......really unfortunate.`
` .........But the thought that your entire life will be decided by that, I think that's just sad."`
`"........................"`
`"You know, people are always making another part of themselves inside themselves that they can really like.`
` This isn't escaping from reality, okay?`
` ......When I'm that other part of myself, I can really feel like I'm living a great life.`
` So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life is, I can definitely live without suffocating."`
`"......To make, `
`...inside yourself, `
`another self that you can really like..."`
`To make another me, which isn't furniture...`
` Through her relationship with George-sama, has Shannon given birth to a part of herself that isn't furniture?`
`......And did this other Shannon, see something that cannot be seen by furniture?`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon-kun.`
` But, ...I can sorta guess.`
` Your private life is probably, nothing at all.`
` Bulls-eye...?"`
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough.`
` He had no concept of a private life.`
` So Kanon would always be Kanon.`
` So furniture would always be furniture.`
`"......Kanon-kun, Kanon isn't your real name, right?"`
`In the Fukuin House, because new graduates would be given new families and a new life, they were even given a new name.`
`......In his case, that was 'Kanon'.`
`".........Certainly, ......that name of mine may be a temporary thing."`
`He had thought that he wasn't anyone other than Kanon.`
`......But he remembered.`
`...There definitely had been a part of himself that wasn't Kanon.`
` But that was far, far away, beyond of the distant fog of oblivion...`
`"So even for you, it should be alright to have times when you're Kanon-kun, and times when you aren't.`
` ......Maybe the Kanon-kun you are when you act as a servant calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."`
`"......But when you aren't Kanon-kun, I think it's alright to live much, much more freely."`
`Those words definitely weren't just lip-service.`
` Jessica had also been like this in the past.`
` She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.`
` Only she had been in a heavily constricted environment. forced to learn various things,`
` and it had even interfered with the friends she had played with.`
`......Even though that was sad, she had given up, thinking that she had just been born under that kind of star.`
` But one day, Jessica had stopped giving up and surrendering.`
` Stuff like the Ushiromiya family customs and pressure, those didn't matter.`
` She had created a real 'Jessica' inside herself, who could do what she really wanted to do.`
`"You know, I'm called by this nickname Jessie in school.`
` So when I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.`
` And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too."`
`"...I wonder if it would be alright for you too, `
`to have times when you live as Kanon, and times when you live as, umm, `
`......your real name.`
` ......When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you become another part of yourself that you can like?"`
`"..................A time when, I am not Kanon."`
`He had thought that his real name didn't matter at all.`
` So he had thought Kanon was all of himself.`
` And now Jessica was saying that he should create a new existence, another part of himself that wasn't Kanon.`
`"......Kanon-kun.`
` If you don't mind, tell me.`
` ......What is, your real name?"`
`"........................"`
`He was silent for quite some time.`
` Maybe Kanon's real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.`
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it, `
`...in the end, `
`...he swallowed it back down.`
`"......I forgot.`
` ...My name doesn't matter anymore."`
`Those words contained a slight rejection.`
`"No matter what kind of real name I had,`
` ......the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.`
` The past has nothing to do with anything.`
` ......The materials with which furniture is made, whether it was originally the trunk of a tree or not, in the end, it's all the same."`
`"......I told you to stop that!`
` You aren't furniture, you're human, right?!"`
`"I am not human!"`
`Kanon clearly spoke his refusal.`
`......It was with a rage that he normally didn't show.`
` Jessica couldn't say anything back, and was struck silent...`
`"...You are human, Milady.`
` So you are free to live any way you like,`
` and any kind of future is possible for you.`
` It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird. `
`But I am not like that.`
` Even if I looked like a bird, I'd be nothing more than a domestic duck.`
` ......Even though they have wings, they cannot fly."`
`"But despite that, to speak of that dream in the sky, `
`......that's just, `
`...too cruel...!"`
`"...Furniture and ducks!!`
` What the hell is all this!! `
`............No, ..."`
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back, and swallowed her words.`
`"............I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through.`
` ...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."`
`"......But know this.`
` You aren't furniture or a duck.`
` You're a real human."`
`"........................"`
`"If you want to say that the Kanon-kun working as a servant is furniture, that's alright.`
` ......But, ...in that case,`
` ......don't you think that you can make a part of yourself for when you aren't furniture, when you're human?"`
`"......Only a human like Milady can embrace that possibility.`
` ...I am not like that.`
` My future and possibilities, aren't even a dream I am supposed to see. `
`............So, Milady. `
`Please don't, `
`...say any more, `
`......cruel things......"`
`"Why...`
` Why, ......are you saying that..."`
`"Because it seems that you are making the mistake that I am a human, just like you are, Milady.`
` We are different beings.`
` I just wanted to make that clear."`
`"......I heard from Shannon.`
` Something about Milady starting to like me."`
`"Huh, ......wha?!`
` Ah, .........no, wahaha..."`
`"...I look almost identical to a human.`
` Therefore, .........like Shannon, maybe I could delude myself that I am human, and for a time, pretend to love."`
`"...But that would surely be fooling myself.`
` No, it would also be fooling you, Milady.`
` Shannon and George-sama will definitely fall apart.`
` ...Even though Shannon herself probably realizes that day will come, ...such a stupid thing..."`
`"Th, ......there's nothing stupid about it!! `
`And, George nii-san's a wonderful person, and he's bearing both of his parents' expectations.`
` ...Yeah, when it comes to marriage, I'm sure Eva oba-san will interfere in various ways, and, umm, I think their future prospects look like they'll be full of trouble, alright?!`
` ...But you know, George nii-san isn't the kind of person who'll surrender to all that!`
` Shannon isn't Juliet, he'll definitely bring her happiness!!"`
`"People cannot love furniture.`
` ...I am trying to say that even if Milady can love furniture, I cannot love Milady."`
`"..................nn-"`
`Those words of Kanon's, ......crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from that day.`
` There was no way her emotions could have predicted that she would be refused so clearly...`
` In an instant, she had lost the willpower that had caused her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart,`
` ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...`
`"......Milady, if your feelings for me are due to my conceit, then please forgive me."`
`"...N, ......no.`
` Well, ...I won't deny that."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"For thinking of me as a human, `
`...thank you very much.`
` Just those feelings truly make me happy.`
` ......And, anything more would be too cruel, so..."`
`"No, th, ...that's enough.`
` ...Umm, `
`.........sorry."`
`Jessica recklessly scratched at her head and spoke, trying to force her voice to sound bright.`
`"......I just kinda, `
`......ran on ahead by myself, `
`...and was a burden on you. `
`...I'm honestly sorry.`
` I'm really sorry, ...for using up your whole day off."`
`"No.`
` ......I was also...happy that I could see Milady having fun."`
`"...Then, let's be done for the night.`
` ......If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom will get mad at me again.`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"That would probably be most appropriate.`
` ...I wish you a good night, Milady."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ............Good night........."`
`Kanon saw Jessica trod away, looking disheartened, with her back to him.`
` But she suddenly started dashing recklessly, and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...`
` As he watched her back, ...for just an instant, `
`Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.`
`...But he hadn't made a mistake at all.`
`......Thinking of her sake, he'd been forced to refuse her now, while the pain was still at its smallest.`
`"............Nice going, making a woman cry like that. `
`*cackle*cackle*.`
` I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly.`
` ......If you had answered normally, another pair of lovers would have been born with my magic."`
`"How long have you been there...?`
` .........You're just horrible."`
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.`
`...It look like she had been there the whole time, enjoying the performance of those two.`
`"I shall forgive your reckless words towards me just this once in deference to that pleasant show.`
` ......Even after one thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between boys and girls.`
` To me, it's a pleasure with a sweetness harder to resist than opium.`
` ......Nn?"`
`Kanon pulled that butterfly brooch out of his pocket.`
` It was the crystallization of the great magic that the witch had bestowed.`
` Without hesitation, Kanon slammed that against the ground and stomped on it.`
`"......Hoh?`
` What is the meaning of this, when you know that was something given by me?"`
`"Just now, I figured it out.`
` ......What you are doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love.`
` You are just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be joined, and deceiving them."`
`"............Hmph.`
` ...You are free to think that.`
` Most humans I have lent my power to have said the same thing."`
`"Don't play dumb!!`
` You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.`
` ...You found a weak point in Shannon's heart as her chest burned with love, and you made her break the mirror that sealed you.`
` And that's not all, `
`...you planned this out until the end, and you're toying with her!`
` Am I wrong?!"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!`
` Furniture is a thoroughly pitiful existence.`
` So you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?`
` Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Gah..."`
`"Just as you've noticed, there is a faint love in Jessica's heart.`
` I had hoped that you would punch a hole in that and harvest it."`
`"......But did you know?`
` Trees grow thicker branches if you thin out and prune them. ......A girl who loves furniture, interesting, truly interesting!`
` Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their love, which cannot be fulfilled, and ripen as the kind of large fruit I like."`
`"However, regretfully, it wouldn't be interesting if they didn't go too far, right?`
` If that happens, I think you all would entertain me greatly, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch laughed.`
` Even though she had known that the two could not be joined, she had lent magic to join them together.`
` However, they couldn't escape the fate that made it impossible for them to be joined.`
`......The witch knew that.`
` Even if they were joined, the relationships of Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would fail,`
` and as they wandered through the eternal desert in the hell of love, they would be tormented by eternal thirst...!`
`"Did I not lend them that power without asking for compensation?`
` I'll lend a hand in love.`
` So that as compensation, I can enjoy watching the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
` Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!"`
`"Just look at Kinzo.`
` See how he ended up, an old, pitiful man who knew the taste of love and was thrown out of paradise!`
` Look at how he lives, like a dead man that can't fully die.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"You really are a witch.`
` Disappear and get out of my sight, you demon...!!"`
`"......I shall disappear without being asked.`
` My power still hasn't returned.`
` It is still tiring to continue showing myself. `
`......I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.`
` ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."`
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.`
` He felt it break under his foot.`
` Then, it evaporated like water, `
`and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, which fluttered away from beneath Kanon's foot...`
`"I also find it painful when I tend to preserve this form.`
` But as you ask, I will erase this form for a brief period.`
` Just like a low tide without the moon, my magical power will surely rise.`
` ...And I will surely visit, at a time that is appropriate for my revival."`
`"......I cannot imagine whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even one hundred or one thousand years in the future.`
` But as long as there are those that entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.`
` ......I will erase this form for a short while, until that time comes."`
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone, `
`so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence disappear like an illusion or a dream.`
` ......I won't be saddened just by you forgetting about me."`
`"However, I will definitely be revived.`
` Make sure that you won't regret that day's coming at any time.`
` I will surely have my second coming and control everything as this island's true master.`
` ...That is the time when the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.`
` ...I will surely wake the greedy dead...!"`
`"...You talk too much!!`
` Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"`
`The witch left with a scorn-filled laugh, became a group of gold butterflies and scattered away.`
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.`
` It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...`
` The witch could no longer be seen.`
`...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...`
`......Aahh, how pleasant, how pleasant.`
` Why is the human world, which I haven't seen in a long time, so pleasant?! `
`Go insane with love. Go insane with gold.`
` Those that don't go insane from those are not human! `
`I see, so that's why the word furniture is fitting, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Furniture is created to serve humans.`
` And I cruelly treat humans as playthings during my thousand years of boredom.`
` What a truly pleasant three-way deadlock, that I cannot control furniture! `
`You fool, Kinzo, do something truly interesting! `
`You, furniture, try and see if you can hit me...! `
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.`
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three!`
`"Beatrice...`
` Why, ...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?`
` ......I hate that.`
` I will hate you for all eternity for not even trying to answer, even though you are yearned after this much...!"`
`"Master, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.`
` ...Haven't you also been warned by Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Be silent, Genji!! `
`You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!`
` Even though I believed that as my oldest friend, at least you would understand my pain!!`
` Why can't you understand?! `
`Oooooohhh, Beatriiiiiice, `
`why did you leave me alooooone......?!!"`
`"........................"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaa!`
` Hic, hic...!`
` What the hell do you mean by furniture?!`
` I don't get it...!`
` Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"......Oooh, how heart-rending, Jessica-sama.`
` ...Even though her crying voice that I can hear from her room tells me of the situation, there is nothing I can do.`
` ...This is all a tragedy due to people who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.`
` ...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, hide my footsteps, and quietly walk away..."`
`"...Umm, `
`...wh, `
`...what...`
`......do you mean by that, `
`George-san...?"`
`"I mean what I said.`
` ......I still haven't built up my castle.`
` Once I can do that, for the first time, I will be able to think of myself as an adult.`
` ......When that happens, I want to marry you."`
`"......Th, `
`......that's, umm, `
`......err..."`
`"But, `
`my heart won't let me do that anymore.`
` ......So I want to give you an engagement ring."`
`"E, ...engagement, `
`......you say...`
` But, umm, `
`......I, `
`......am, `
`...............furniture........."`
`"Maybe that's true.`
` And furniture has to listen to what people say. `
`...Now, I will have a ring made that's appropriate to give to you.`
` I think I'll probably bring it to the family conference coming up soon.`
` I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."`
`"......If you accept my engagement proposal,`
` I will proclaim right there, to all of the relatives, including Grandfather, my engagement to you."`
`"G, ......George-san............"`
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship.`
` ...But, there's no need to look at their faces.`
` ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."`
`"I will definitely make you happy.`
` That, I promise you, definitely."`
`I look forward to seeing how it will ripen! `
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.`
` I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?! *cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
