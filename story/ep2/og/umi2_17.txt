`Battler's figure was in the dining hall.`
` He didn't feel like going back to the guesthouse in the middle of this rain,`
` and wandered halfheartedly inside the mansion in search for a place where he could sit adequately, ...making the dining hall into his stronghold.`
` It wasn't even locked.`
` He thought that maybe the shapeless murderer, or the Golden Witch, would come to kill him now that he was isolated, `
`but he no longer thought about confronting the culprit.`
` On the contrary, he didn't even feel like using the locks to block the culprit.`
` He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.`
`...If it was the murderer, he thought he'd ask them to tell about some of those wonderful closed room tricks as a parting souvenir.`
` If it was the witch, he thought that she would at least take his life with some wonderful magic.`
`......However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet Battler....`
` Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content.`
` No longer was there anybody anywhere who would have a problem with him drinking alcohol.`
` He boldly set both of his legs on the extravagant table cloth and savored the high quality liquor, which probably had a mind-boggling price, tilting down each one of the bottles....`
` At that time, ...someone knocked.`
` Battler realized that someone had finally come to greet him...`
`"He-y, it is not locked. `
`Whoever you are, please come in. `
`And please introduce yourself. `
`If you are a human being, please, gimme your name. `
`If you are Beatrice, please, tell me your bust size."`
`"Even though I look like this, I am well know as a breast-sommelier, you see? ... Hic."`
`".........It's Genji, Battler-sama."`
`"...Genji-san, is it.`
`......Sorry, but I have no interest in your bust size. `
`Please, come in. It's open."`
`".........Excuse me."`
`Genji-san opened the door and bowed.`
`.........So Genji-san was the criminal after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?`
`......That theory probably explains most of the tricks...`
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?"`
`".........Nothing of the sort. `
`......I apologize if I am disturbing you."`
`"...Hey, hey, saying I'm sorry without even telling me what you want is actually pretty creepy. `
`...What do you want? `
`......Are you gonna tell me that drinking alcohol is forbidden for minors? I'll just die anyway. ...Please, let me do as I wish, at least in the very end."`
`"......... Battler-sama, do you love alcohol so much, `
`that you will spend the little time you have left before you die drinking it?"`
`Those words, pierced me....`
`......That wasn't true.`
`"...............................`
` It's just that, if I don't drink it, nobody will. `
`......I don't know the flavor of alcohol at all..."`
`"......You are just like Master. `
`Indeed, you inherited Master's blood strongly...."`
`"You mean that Grandfather, the heavy drinker, drank to drown all his cares in alcohol...? `
`That's a first."`
`".........After some sad incidents, `
`Master's life, `
`......was completely reduced to atonement."`
`"...What do you know?"`
`"............Beatrice's ceremony was completely finished by the eighth twilight. `
`...I believe that I can now tell you everything."`
`"Wha-......what did you say...?"`
`My drunkenness was completely blown away.`
` I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what kind of words Genji would say next....`
`"Battler-sama.`
`......I shall guide you to the Master's study. `
`......It would probably be better to hear it directly from them."`
`"From, ......them...? `
`H-hey, what in the world do you mean by that...!!"`
`"......Come, this way. `
`I shall guide you. `
`Battler-sama."`
`After Genji-san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.`
` I threw my drunkenness off completely and went after him...`
` We climbed a big staircase, .........towards the third floor.`
` Genji-san stopped walking halfway.`
` He then turned back and spoke.`
`".........Battler-sama. `
`......From here on, `
`..........you will probably see things you will not be able to understand."`
`"Don't threaten me. `
`.........Today, I've seen more things I can't understand than I'd have liked to."`
`".........What you see is as it appears. `
`What you hear is as it sounds, so please accept it."`
`"Why? `
`What? `
`...There is no need for questions like that. `
`...Battler-sama, you will probably at least know the truth. `
`I will leave it completely up to you, Battler-sama, `
`whether to accept it, believe it, or deny it."`
`"....................................."`
`Genji-san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to know the truth.`
` The eighth twilight had already ended.`
` And at the ninth twilight, the witch would be revived, ......and nobody would be left alive.`
` It meant that Beatrice was already being revived.`
`...And probably, none of us would be allowed to live and return.`
` If I was going lose my life anyway, ......I wanted to know the truth in the end.`
`...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept.`
`"..................Yeah.`
`......Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared."`
`".........Indeed, you are just like the Master in his youth. `
`......Battler-sama, please be diligent in your studies. `
`In the future, you will surely have great aspirations. `
`And at that time, make sure that there is nothing that you will regret for your entire life due to lack of knowledge."`
`".........If I have a chance to work hard in my studies, then no problem."`
`"..............................."`
`It felt like Genji-san's silence forced me to consider that resignation of mine more deeply...`
` And, .........we could see the door of Grandfather's study, impregnated with a sweet smell.`
` Genji-san picked a gold key with an elegant design out from his pocket.`
` The master keys had been confiscated by Rosa oba-san, but the key to this study was the only one he had kept with him.`
` He put it in the keyhole, .........and it made a heavy clunking sound.`
`".........Master. `
`It's Genji. `
`I brought Battler-sama with me."`
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go in had been given....`
`"Come, Battler-sama. `
`......Please, go in."`
`"..................Yeah. `
`......I'll go in."`
`I readied myself, ......and threw the door open....`
` At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow..........`
` It was, .........somehow, `
`......a swarm of butterflies, shining gold.`
` The golden butterflies that were completely filling the inside of the study poured out all at once.......`
`" Wha-............, `
`......What is, `
`.............this......................"`
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti.`
` The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow....`
` And, ...... there was a sofa like a reception chair in front of the study desk, `
`.........where I could see Grandfather's back.ã€€`
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.`
`...It was a shadow, so I couldn't see it well....`
`"...... Master. `
`I brought Battler-sama."`
`"............Battler, is it? `
`I'm busy thinking now... `
`Be silent for a while......"`
`Kinzo declared that unhappily, his back still turned.`
` It seemed that he was enjoying playing chess with a visitor....`
` Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.`
` Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning....`
`"I have thought for 30 years. `
`......I have thought for 30 years about how to counterattack this move.... `
`Have fun, have fun with the move I have fermented for 30 years."`
`"......Heheheheheheheh. `
`Indeed, this is a deeply matured move. `
`......So fun, so fun..., *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!! `
`Unbearable, unbearable."`
`"...... Wha-,`
`............ What is, "`
`.........this.........`
`"So you came, Battler. `
`I've been waiting for a while. `
`Be silent for Kinzo's sake. `
`...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo? `
`I could already counterattack it in several ways. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`It should have been, `
`......my first meeting with that witch.`
` However, ...I knew this witch.`
` Even though it was our first meeting, `
`...I knew her, `
`......from the portrait......!`
`"Genji. `
`Serve some alcohol for Battler. `
`What would be an appropriate liquor for this man...?"`
`"......That liquor which Master has loved since the days of his youth."`
`"That's good, serve it. `
`......You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`First, sit down. `
`.........You called my name many times, did you not? `
`In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me. `
`...So, what will you ask me? `
`What will you inquire? `
`......The door of the Golden Land will soon be opened. `
`Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, at which I will be welcoming the witches. `
`...In the meantime, I'll be answering your questions, as many as you like."`
`" I, ......I have a bunch of things I want to ask about!! `
`What happened on this island?! `
`And why did incidents like these occur?! `
`I want to ask about the closed rooms too!! `
`What about the chapel?! `
`What about Jessica's room?! `
`And the servant room?! `
`And Natsuhi oba-san's room?! `
`And the parlor?!"`
`"There's much more I want to ask about!! `
`About the witch's true nature!! `
`Is Beatrice really a witch?!! `
`What is your purpose, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!! `
`Answer me, about everything!!!"`
`"Eeeeeehhh, be quiet!! `
`You think you'll get answers if you ask?!?!"`
`"Don't say that, Kinzo. `
`A fragile and fleeting spider web did protect from King Herod once. `
`......Just like there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."`
`"Veery well, I'll answer all your questions. `
`......But, there is only one condition."`
`"What is it?"`
`"If you hear everything and are able to accept my existence, `
`............kneel and kiss my shoes. `
`I called you here because I wanted to make you surrender to me."`
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet. `
`We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me making you surrender. `
`I don't feel like losing. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...D, ............Damn you, talking so tough!! `
`Yeah, alright. `
`Try to make me admit it. `
`...Try to make me admit that you're a witch and that you can use weird, awesome, and great magic!!"`
`"If I surrender, I'll kiss you or do anything else!!!"`
`The witch cackled gloatingly.`
` Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word...`
`"Well said!! `
`So, from what question shall I begin?! `
`I'll answer everything!! `
`Come, what will the first one be?!?!"`
