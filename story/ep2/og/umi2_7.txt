`"...Maria hasn't come back.`
` ......I wonder if she's been scolded by Rosa oba-san again."`
`Since they had met Maria in the airport, she had been romping around about Halloween the whole time.`
`...But maybe she had cut loose a little too much,`
` and acted a little too boisterous on the plane, on the boat, and during lunch, because Rosa had warned her several times.`
` In times like that, Rosa oba-san would rarely scold her in front of people.`
`...More commonly, she would call Maria into the shadows, and scold her when they were alone.`
` So since Maria had been called off somewhere, they thought she must be getting scolded.`
` When they looked at the clock, they realized that it was almost 6:00.`
` They couldn't really imagine that Maria had been scolded this whole time.`
` Maybe it was time for some anime she watched every week to start.`
` She had probably stayed in the mansion's parlor the whole time.`
`"Possibly, Battler-sama has woken up and they are playing together."`
`"That's because Maria-chan thinks of Battler-kun as a new friend.`
` ...I'm sure it was tons of fun when she played Halloween with Battler-kun at the airport."`
`"Battler was messing around a lot himself.`
` Even though that guy's gotten big, he hasn't changed a bit since long ago."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I get the feeling that Battler-sama was gracious enough to remain as he was six years ago."`
`"Shannon, do you remember about Battler-kun six years ago?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because he was, well, very energetic.`
` *giggle*."`
`"I also remember how the four of us used to play six years ago.`
` Shannon acted a lot like a big sister."`
`"That's right.`
` I get the feeling that she was even more level-headed then than she is now.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"B, ...back then I, umm, ......didn't act fitting for my place so...`
` umm, I did some rude things..."`
`"......It's alright to act like that. `
`Forget when you're working, when you're taking your break, like now, I want you to stay with us and be friendly."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Treat the servant Shannon and off-duty Sayo differently.`
` ......You aren't a slave, you're just working as a servant, right? `
`.........I think of you, Shannon, `
`...no, Sayo, as my oldest friend."`
`"............Thank you very much, Milady."`
`It seemed that Shannon understood the hidden meaning behind Jessica's words.`
`......Because she had heard a little bit about Jessica's and Kanon's history from both of them.`
`"..............."`
`Apparently, George had also been informed about that history, more or less.`
` As George approached the window, he looked up at the darkening rainy sky...`
`"...Even though Kanon-kun is still young, I think that he's starting to grow a bit in his way of thinking."`
`"Uhh, hahahaha...`
` C'mon, quit it already. `
`Well, umm, I think there's been some times when I've been sucked in by the atmosphere...`
` Well, umm, ...maybe after looking at you two, umm, I got a little jealous, and sometimes started feeling a little rushed."`
`"......Wh, what happens to me isn't important.`
` More importantly, how's it going between you two?`
` Looks like it's goin' pretty well, eh?`
` Ehehe!"`
`"Err, ......I, ...I wonder..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's going very well."`
`Shannon was lost for words, her face red, while George answered brightly and immediately.`
` That carefree attitude made it obvious that their relationship was proceeding so perfectly, it would make anyone envious.`
`"Heh, I'm jealous. `
`......That mean Shannon's gonna resign and have a party soon?"`
`"I, I wonder...`
` I am, umm......"`
`"I wonder, right?`
` How could I know?"`
`George laughed like he was being mean and drew closer to Shannon.`
` ...It was probably the way they usually flirted when they were alone.`
` Jessica could only smile bitterly and say yes, yes, thank you, that's enough.`
`"I have a dream.`
` It isn't only an ambition to become the leader of my own domain in business.`
` I also have a dream to build a family together with a partner I can spend my life with."`
`"...I want two kids at the very least.`
` And I'd like to do some sports that the whole family could do together.`
` And many more things besides that.`
` I often talk with Shannon about that kind of thing.`
` .........Although every time I talk about that sort of thing, Shannon always laughs and says I'm getting ahead of myself."`
`"...For some reason, even at the age I am now, I've started having some calmer thoughts like I'm in my old age.`
` ......Healthy grown kids, and grandchildren running around.`
` If only I could spend the rest of my life at a slow pace, surrounded by that, and together with Shannon forever."`
`"You're definitely getting ahead of yourself. `
`......But, how should I say it, it sounds like you, George nii-san."`
`"Being surrounded by that family would probably be so wonderful.`
` ......The ideal family that I've painted in my mind is something like that."`
`...To Shannon, who had been raised in an orphanage, that harmonious image of a family was probably something she yearned after.`
`......And George, who promised that he would definitely grant that wish for her, was surely a fitting person for her to spend her life with...`
` Shannon was an important friend to Jessica.`
`......George was surely the one most fit to entrust that friend's future to.`
`"Well, I don't want to throw cold water on you guys, `
`......but forget about Hideyoshi oji-san, what would happen with Eva oba-san?`
` Wouldn't it be tough to convince her?"`
`"..............."`
`"Ah-hah-hah-ha.`
` There's no reason for anyone to worry about something like that. `
`......No one can worry about who I chose to be my partner.`
` Shannon makes me happy.`
` Whose permission do I need?"`
`"......Whoa--. `
`George nii-san, that was cool...`
` I can't believe you can say something so embarrassing out loud.`
` I thought George didn't used to be that kind of character."`
`"If you don't see a boy for three days, you should watch them closely. `
`......Even I grow up.`
` ...I plan to study more and more to make Shannon happy and grow to be a suitable man."`
`Did George even realize how embarrassing the words coming out of his mouth were? `
`His face turned very slightly red, and he scratched his head.`
`"............George-san."`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure Mother will be difficult, but you can leave that to me.`
` I'll show you that I can make all of the relatives accept you as my partner."`
`"Awesome... `
`I'm jealous of you Shannon, seriously!"`
`"......I, if you will go so far then, `
`.........I, I'm sorry to trouble you..."`
`"Wait a sec, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting in the way.`
` Would it be better if I le-ft?"`
`When Jessica stood up from the bed she had been sitting on, smiling bitterly,`
` at that very moment, the phone rang.`
` Before Jessica picked up the receiver, wondering what business they could have, Shannon looked at the clock, taken aback.`
`......Somehow or another, it seemed that she had taken too long on her break.`
`"I, I am sorry...!`
` I forgot it was time for work...!`
` Th, then, if you will excuse me...!"`
`At the same time that Jessica picked up the phone, Shannon began dashing out of the room.`
`"Ah, Shannon!`
` .........Again, same time, same place."`
`"Y, .........yes. `
`...E, excuse me!"`
`"Hello, it's Jessica.`
` .........Ah, Genji-san.`
` Yes, Shannon is going back to you guys now.`
` We held her up.`
` Please don't scold her.`
` Yeah, yes."`
`"I see.`
` So it will be time to prepare dinner very soon."`
`Many plates were lined up on the counter in the kitchen. Preparations for dinner were proceeding steadily.`
`......The number of plates that were lined up there...`
`......was 19.`
` That number was one more than were lined up during the family conference every year.`
`"I can't accept it...!`
` Why can't I deliver it directly?!"`
`Gohda-san flared up at Genji, paying no heed to the pot that was boiling over.`
` The Master enjoyed having his food alone in his study, so the food needed to be set out in the study.`
` However, this always happened.`
` Gohda-san really wanted to set the table for the Master with his own hands, as he had put his heart and soul into his cooking.`
`......But the Master had imposed a strict rule that none but the servants bearing the Golden Eagle crest could enter his study.`
`.........So while Gohda-san could greet the Master from outside the study,`
` not once had he been granted the honor of carrying his cooking into the study.`
` Gohda-san was always unsatisfied with this.`
`...Of course he was a newcomer in terms of years of service.`
` However, he had piled up plenty of experience from his previous jobs, and he was strongly confident that he would always be able to perform in front of Kinzo in a way that would not insult him.`
` And yet, just because he was not permitted the Golden Eagle, he still hadn't been blessed with this honor.`
`......You can probably imagine what damage that did to his pride.`
` You might think that tonight was another repeat of that, but it wasn't.`
` Because tonight, there was a person other than the Master who wanted their food carried to their room.`
` Apparently, this person was a very rare and honored guest, and there had been a strict order to treat this person in the same manner as the Master, who was the family head.`
` Gohda-san must have wanted to earn some points by serving this honored guest with his own hands.`
` Because he was a person of strong vanity.`
` If he wasn't qualified to serve the Master, then at least a guest of the same rank...`
` He couldn't have made time during lunch no matter what, so Kanon-san had gone for him.`
`...Therefore, he truly desired to serve tonight's food, the best dinner of the year.`
` But Genji-san had had a problem with that.`
`......Something about how Gohda-san didn't have the Golden Eagle.`
`.........After being scolded that he wasn't qualified again, Gohda-san had lost his patience.`
` Aah, so heartrending, Gohda-san...`
` I cannot do anything more than watch like this from the shadows...`
`"Kumasawa-san, if you have enough free time to dawdle around, please prepare the dining hall. `
`Is the tablecloth ready?!"`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho..., oh my, my apologies..."`
`When it became her turn to bear the brunt, Kumasawa softly disappeared into the hall.`
`"Beatrice-sama is of exactly the same rank as the Master.`
` ......We must respect this rule in the same way we do with the Master."`
`"......Gohda-san, if you would, please devote your attention entirely towards the task you are confident in, for all of the relatives..."`
`"I don't mind if it's you, Genji-san, but is it really alright to let a child like this go to such a guest?!`
` If she made some blunder, it would be quite rude."`
`"I know that they have served here for a long time, but that doesn't mean that they have been trained in the proper areas.`
` If you will allow me to speak freely, they have no foundation which makes them able to interact with this guest!"`
`".................."`
`Even though Shannon was waiting there in the kitchen, Gohda spoke so bluntly.`
` Shannon was the one who Genji had ordered to carry the food to Beatrice's room.`
`......By the ranking system among the servants permitted the Golden Eagle, Shannon was surely the second highest ranked.`
`...If the highest ranked, Genji, went to set the table in Kinzo's room, then it fell to Shannon to set the table in Beatrice's room.`
` Gohda's pride was always horribly injured when he was shown this ranking system.`
`...In times like that, he would speak out bluntly and rudely about Shannon and Kanon.`
` Gohda kept raising examples of each one of Shannon's failures until now, making a ruckus about how this was wrong and that was wrong.`
` Shannon, who listened to this and hung her head in shame, heard Kanon's voice from behind her.`
`...Kanon had heard everything, having approached from a blind spot in the hall along the wall near the entrance to the kitchen.`
`...He probably knew that if he entered the kitchen, sparks would start to fly his way.`
`"............Let me say it.`
` He's a horrible man."`
`"......B, but, it would help to build up a foundation of experience on how to entertain someone.`
` ......Gohda-san has learned a lot, so he could be a good reference...?"`
`"Heh.`
` ......Nee-san, you sure are nice."`
`"......More importantly, `
`............is the guest in the VIP room, `
`...really Beatrice-sama, as they say?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........I met her when I was made to set the table for her during lunch.`
` ...There's no mistake, it's her."`
`"R, really?`
` Was she doing well?"`
`".................."`
`Kanon remembered that he and Shannon had different impressions about Beatrice.`
` To Shannon, Beatrice was a cupid of love, who had granted her magic to create her relationship with George.`
` Judging by the expression that rose to her face, `
`...it looked like she couldn't wait to inform Beatrice of how her relationship with George had progressed.`
`......However, Kanon already knew.`
` That witch had come here with a terrifying goal in mind.`
`......That vague witch that only they had been able to see in the past, had now walked in openly through the front door,`
` and had revived enough that they could now carry food to her.`
`...In the past, when she had disappeared from in front of Kanon...`
` The witch had said something about how her own power was still weak.`
`.........Did that mean that the witch, who could now appear openly like this, had finally returned to her former power? `
`And she had said that.`
`.........She had definitely said that she had known of his failure and had sown the seeds of love.`
` She had said something else.`
`.........She had definitely said that the day on which the door to the Golden Land would be opened had finally come.`
`".........Shannon.`
` ...She will hold some bizarre ceremony with the Master, ...and will surely do something unimaginably horrible.`
` ......And no one can resist that."`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"She came here. `
`...As the Master requested, so that the door to the Golden Land would open, and so that everything would be returned to the Golden Land. `
`She definitely said that to me!"`
`"........................"`
`In the past, `
`......the two of them, as furniture working for Kinzo, had been told what opening of the door to the Golden Land meant.`
` Therefore, even without asking a single question in response, Shannon understood everything.`
`.........So, ...she grew deeply hopeless.`
`...Something tore at Kanon's heart as he looked at that expression twisted with grief...`
`"............How could, `
`.........why, ...why now........."`
`"......Didn't I tell you?`
` We are furniture!`
` ......Because we acted like humans, because of love, .........we can't obediently accept the day when our service is over...!"`
`"..................At one time, in the past, I wished that this day would come.`
` ......But it never came after so much time...`
`......I didn't know how long we would be able stand being tormented as furniture...`
`.........So I thought.`
` ...I thought that day of rest wouldn't come for all eternity."`
`".........That's what I thought!`
` But I believed that it would definitely come someday!`
` So I never forgot that I am furniture!`
` But Nee-san, you forgot that!"`
`"..................It's, ......my fault, isn't it......`
`.........I'm......"`
`"Yeah, it's your fault, Nee-san.`
` ......If only you hadn't known love...`
`......we would both be happy that this day has finally come!`
` You built up shameless regrets!`
` Even though it was a world that you must not leave!!"`
`"...............Will the ceremony, ...begin tonight...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...............Then, she said this to me.`
` ...Tonight, George-sama will probably give you an engagement ring, Nee-san."`
`"........................"`
`That was a fact.`
`......George should have snuck in an engagement ring in his pocket today.`
`......And surely, he would hand it over tonight.`
`"......She joined you together, planning to use you and George-sama as the sacrifices of the second twilight. `
`...Understand?`
` By tempting you, Nee-san, she took advantage of you!"`
`"............That's right.`
` ......I never thought of that."`
`"But she told me.`
` ...She promised that if you don't accept the engagement ring tonight, you won't be chosen as a sacrifice, Nee-san.`
` ............I think that our chances of being able to go to the Golden Land together are very slim.`
` There will be 13 people as sacrifices.`
` Only five people will be left alive.`
` ...The chances of us being a part of that group are really slim.`
` ......However, if only you, Nee-san, can take advantage of that promise, those chances rise higher!`
` I want to take that bet! `
`Our salvation is in the Golden Land.`
` If we can make it that far, we can become human.`
` And I want to walk through life as a human, together with you, Nee-san...!`
` If we do that, we might be able to achieve, `
`......true love!"`
`"........................`
`...In the past, we used to dream about being able to go to the Golden Land.`
` .........If we go there, any wish will be granted.`
` .........We will be saved from this pain.`
` ............We believed that."`
`However, in this ceremony, only a few people, decided by fate and chance, would be invited to the Golden Land.`
`......Everyone else would lose their life as a sacrifice midway through the ceremony.`
` However, in the past, Shannon and Kanon had thought that whether they reached the Golden Land, `
`or were made sacrifices, they would still be released from their duties as furniture.`
`......So in other words, this ceremony would definitely give release to furniture like them.`
`"I don't like it.`
` ......I want to take back everything painful that we lost until now, together with you, Nee-san.`
` I won't become a sacrifice.`
` Nee-san and I will remain alive.`
` And we'll reach the Golden Land together."`
`".........So I won't let you become the sacrifice of the second twilight!`
` Please, Nee-san!`
` Don't accept that man's ring!`
` If you don't accept that, she promised not to select you as a sacrifice, Nee-san!!"`
`"..................I, ......cannot do that.`
` ......Tonight's ring is very special.`
` ......My heart won't permit me to not accept it."`
`"Nee-san...!`
` The sacrifices of the ceremony are decided on the witch's whim!`
` That witch has promised to overlook just you, Nee-san!!`
` Only you will definitely be able to go to the Golden Land!"`
`"......Only me?`
` What about you, Kanon-kun?"`
`"The witch's game, ......is enough for me.`
` ...I'll slip through her evil hand.`
` .........I am not powerless.`
` I'll forcibly grasp that small chance..."`
`"........................"`
`"After all, our lives are temporary, aren't they?`
` ...In order to begin our real lives, `
`......let's drag ourselves to the Golden Land.`
` Then, `
`...we will gain humanity."`
`"............And when we've done that, `
`...maybe I want to, `
`......be able to know love, like you, Nee-san.`
` Can I still, `
`.........let a person cry just because I'm furniture......?"`
`".........Kanon-kun............"`
`"I, `
`......don't like being furniture anymore......!`
` ......I'll definitely, `
`...become human......`
`...From this pain, `
`......definitely.........!"`
`"........................"`
`There were tears in Kanon's eyes...`
` By now, Kanon had noticed.`
`......Shannon hadn't been the only one to know and suffer the taste of love.`
` He had too.`
` The tears Jessica had shown him that day, `
`......and Jessica's pitiful face as she tried to smooth things over and brighten her mood until today,`
` had slowly wrought some kind of change on Kanon's heart without him knowing it...`
`".........Shannon!`
` I have been calling to you for some time."`
`Shannon was taken aback by Genji's sudden voice.`
` Apparently, she had been called for repeatedly.`
` She hurriedly answered.`
`......When she turned back, Kanon had disappeared.`
`......It seemed he didn't feel like showing his tears to anybody...`
`"Y, yes.`
` I'm sorry for being careless..."`
`"I entrusted Kanon with lunch, but it should have been you, as the next in rank after me, that carried it.`
` .........Beatrice-sama is the most honored guest of this house.`
` There is no more honored guest than her.`
` ......Please think of her as another Master, and be polite."`
`"...Is that alright? I sincerely ask that you make no blunders.`
` It is quite painful for me to entrust this to someone inexperienced as yourself, but there's nothing we can do about the house's rules.`
` ......I am sincerely counting on you."`
`Gohda had officially agreed, but he threatened Shannon with an expression that told her that he definitely wouldn't forgive any mistakes.`
` Shannon thought that Gohda should just go if he wanted to that much,`
` ......but she thought of her responsibilities as one who had been granted the Golden Eagle, and had to give up.`
`......And.`
`...I wanted to meet Beatrice.`
` What will I talk about?`
` What will I ask?`
` ...I don't know.`
` Will this be a meeting of gratitude?`
` Or else, grief? `
`Or else, ...what?`
` ...I don't know.`
` Shannon piled the witch's food onto the serving cart, and left the kitchen with a slow gait...`
` The person who knocked was Krauss.`
`"Father.`
` Today is our annual family conference.`
` Haven't the siblings gathered here to get a glance of you, Father?"`
`"Aaah, be silent!!`
` I'm saying I won't leave!`
` I imagine that you are there, Genji!!`
` Why haven't you had my food brought here as I ordered you to?!!"`
`Kinzo screamed across the door.`
`...Genji was waiting behind Krauss.`
`"......Your meal has been prepared so that it may be carried to the study.`
` ...However, Krauss-sama said that he wanted you to go downstairs tonight..."`
`"Father.`
` I don't mean every day.`
` Even if it's just for tonight, won't you gather together with your family?"`
`"Who are you calling family!! `
`When did you start calling those vultures who wait for me to collapse and die family?!`
` Have you started calling rotting, gushing maggots family?!!"`
`".....................`
`...My, my."`
`Krauss shrugged at this answer, which he had half expected.`
`"Genji, carry the meal here as you were told!!`
` Why don't you listen to what I say?!!`
` Why?!`
` WHY?!!"`
`"......Genji-san.`
` I will leave the rest to you.`
` ...My voice will no longer reach that person."`
`Krauss gave his head a small shake, and quickly turned his back on the door to the study.`
`......He had only called out for the siblings' sake, even though he knew it was useless.`
` After Genji watched Krauss go down the stairs, he called again across the door.`
`"...Master.`
` We have finished preparations for the meal to be carried here.`
` .........What about a serving for Doctor Nanjo?"`
`Nanjo's figure was in the study.`
` Because Kinzo had strongly pestered him about resolving their long lasting chess game, Nanjo had been Kinzo's opponent since before evening.`
` Nanjo had announced as a doctor that Kinzo's days were numbered.`
`...In that situation, if Kinzo pestered him about finishing a chess game while he was still alive, Nanjo couldn't refuse.`
` Kinzo was thinking deeply about his move, concentrating more than usual.`
`......It had been Kinzo's turn for quite some time, and Nanjo, who was tired of waiting, had randomly pulled out a book on magic that he couldn't understand and was skimming it.`
`".........Kinzo-san.`
` You won't think of a good move just by folding your arms and sitting in front of the board.`
` I wonder if it wouldn't be good to take a break and refresh our minds...?"`
`"Be silent.`
` ......Hmmm.`
` ......That should be good enough for defense.`
` Will the bishop and the knight be able to penetrate that hole...?`
` ............nnnnnnnn..."`
`Today, Kinzo was insistent on a strong defense.`
`......Normally, Kinzo's motto was that offense was the best defense.`
` However, today was completely the opposite.`
`"............I am also hungry.`
` Shall we suspend the game here?`
` And I've used my head so much without a break that I'm already feeling dizzy.`
` ......Any more of this might limit my ability to make my best moves."`
`"...That is a problem.`
` ............In chess, both players must always make their best moves.`
` ...Other moves are painful to understand, and ruin a game that is about reading thoughts.`
` ...That considerably reduces our enjoyment."`
`Kinzo sighed deeply, and finally shifted his gaze away from the board.`
` Chess needed an opponent.`
`...If that opponent was tired and was trying to suspend the game, too bad...`
`"It is true that the goal of chess is for both players to aim for victory and make the best moves possible in order to achieve that.`
` ...It is an intellectual game of being able to read each other."`
`"......But Kinzo-san, are you forgetting that there is another goal separate from victory?"`
`"............What?`
` What goal could there be other than victory?"`
`"Hahahaha......`
` Imagine that Kinzo-san would forget something like that.`
` ...Through chess, you get to spend some fun time with your friend,`
` you see."`
`"Ah,`
` ......I give up.`
` I believe those are words I said to you a long time ago.`
` ............I give up."`
`Kinzo, who normally wore a frown, surprisingly relaxed his face and laughed.`
`...Nanjo felt like he had been reunited with a close friend he hadn't seen in a long time.`
`"That's how it is.`
` Now that I've taken a shot back at you, what do you think?`
` Will you go down to eat with me?`
` What do you say about discussing Kasparov's middle game along with some coffee?"`
`"........................`
`...A good plan, but I will refrain.`
` ......I can no longer leave this room.`
` ...Because the ceremony has begun."`
`"............Is that so?`
` Well, my stomach is growling.`
` ...I will go downstairs.`
` Any time you feel like it-"`
`"Nanjo.`
` ............Thank you."`
`"......Oh, what could you be thanking me for?"`
`"...We didn't resolve our chess match.`
` ......However, it seems that I have somehow succeeded in that goal of chess which I forgot.`
` It seems that was just as important as checkmate."`
`"This isn't like you.`
` Why so sentimental?"`
`".........You said it, didn't you?`
` My days are numbered. `
`......Now, go.`
` And don't come to this room again.`
` ......Maybe we will continue in the Golden Land."`
`"...................`
`...That is fine, but I have a score to settle.`
` Losing that rook was a serious blow. `
`......Well then, I will see you later."`
`"Yes, later.`
` ............Maybe in the Golden Land, or in Purgatory.`
` Or maybe the next world."`
`"....................."`
`Nanjo didn't say anything beyond that.`
` And, with a practiced hand, he pushed the button on the table that would release the auto-lock.`
` Then after looking at Kinzo's back one last time, he left the study.`
` As he did, Genji's voice came from the hall.`
`"......Well then, Master.`
` I will now carry in your dinner."`
`"It may be my final dinner.`
` I must savor it.`
` ......Please, prepare it."`
`"Certainly.`
` ............Is everything to Master's satisfaction?"`
`"...Hmm.`
` Until today, this room has been wrapped in a multitude of rigorous barriers.`
` .........Even if that roulette chooses me, I will definitely repel it.`
` ...I will remain alive, and I will definitely become one of those who reach the Golden Land...!`
` ......I will reject the visit of the gods of death that try to drag me off to Hades..."`
`".........Excuse me.`
` ...I have come to prepare the meal."`
`Shannon entered the VIP room, bowing her head and pushing the serving cart.`
` The young woman by the window, gazing out into the darkness, where nothing should have been visible, was definitely that witch.`
`"So it is Shannon this time.`
` How nostalgic.`
` .........Hoh.`
` The color of your face looks quite well, doesn't it?`
` Different from Kanon.`
` Almost beyond recognition."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`Shannon solemnly prepared dinner.`
`...There were actually several things that she wanted to ask and talk about with the witch.`
`...But those things were all jumbled up, and she didn't know where to start.`
` Her heart was also jumbled up with various things, and she didn't even understand her own emotions.`
`...Therefore, still remaining vague, she could only do her job indifferently.`
` However, the witch guessed what was in her heart.`
` You couldn't hide things from a witch...`
`"...............I won't apologize.`
` Because I am a witch."`
`"......For what?"`
`"Come.`
` ...Kanon must have told you about it.`
` Saving your love life was simply my mischievous spirit.`
` ......It was nothing more than a seed I sowed to appreciate how things would get complicated, become twisted, and fail."`
`".........There are some who think it is more fun to hear about love than to have it."`
`"You, .........couldn't possibly be trying to thank me, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ......No matter what kind of ulterior motive you had when you gave me the magic of love, `
`......it doesn't change the fact that I received it from you. `
`.........So even if you sowed that seed knowing that the two of us wouldn't be able to stay together for life, `
`...I won't hold a grudge against you."`
`"............Hmmmm.`
` ......It appears that furniture isn't interesting after all. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` This is where I show my skill by cooking it into something interesting."`
`"......I don't understand what you are thinking, Beatrice-sama.`
` ......You are a Great Witch, and people like us don't even reach your feet,`
` ...nor can we even imagine your grand thoughts.`
` But there is at least one thing I can say."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Thank you for teaching me to be human.`
` .........You said it.`
` ...I am no longer furniture."`
`"...............Be silent, furniture.`
` ...If you were a true human, hearing the announcement of your death on the day that you were to receive an engagement ring should have you dancing around, mad with grief."`
`"But what are you doing?`
` Doesn't your face look so enlightened, as though you have accepted everything?`
` ......Truly an anticlimax. Furniture...!"`
`"No.`
` I am not furniture."`
`"Be silent, furniture."`
`"I won't be silent.`
` Because I am not furniture."`
`"Are you saying you won't listen to my orders?"`
`"Furniture obeys orders.`
` ...But a human decides for herself whether to obey orders or not.`
` So I won't obey your orders."`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* hahahahahahahahahahahaha...!`
` ......I'll take back what I said.`
` You really are interesting."`
`"......If I hadn't sowed those seeds, you probably would have allowed the ceremony to control your fate without clinging on to any emotions.`
` ......But now you have been brought up to be truly interesting, which pleases me to the bottom of my heart.`
` That will be fine.`
` Because I don't love boredom.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........I have finished preparations for dinner.`
` ...Here you go."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Doesn't this look delicious?`
` .........If Gohda makes it to the Golden Land, it would be desirable to commission him as my chief cook."`
`"......I heard from Kanon-kun.`
` .........Something about, if I rejected George-san's proposal, you promised not to make me a sacrifice."`
`"Hmm.`
` I did.`
` ......But that was only as a candidate for the sacrifice of the second twilight.`
` ...Kanon cried and screamed that I should forgive you for that, so I graciously listened to his words.`
` With the condition that you give up your engagement.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, see how gracious I am?"`
`"............What a foolish condition.`
` And what a foolish threat.`
` ......Is that how you bullied Kanon-kun so much?"`
`"Hoh.`
` So you understand.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Apparently, Shannon had seen through it.`
`......Apparently, she could imagine how much Kanon had been bullied and humiliated by the witch, with that horrible promise as bait.`
`"I made him crawl on the carpet and kiss my shoes.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` And that's not all.`
` ......Do you want to hear the other ways in which I humiliated him...?"`
`Shannon silently shook her head.`
`"I have finally come to understand you.`
` You like to bully, confuse, and trouble people, and you do it to entertain yourself. `
`.........So I'm now sure that this is the way to resist you."`
`"What is?"`
`"I don't know you.`
` ...I will carry out the fate that has been given to me.`
` So I won't entertain you."`
`"......I don't, know youu...?"`
`The witch's features twisted in hatred for just an instant.`
`...It disappeared immediately,`
` but that expression that rose to her face for only a brief time was unusual for the witch, whose malicious smile hadn't disappeared even once.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ...Can you resist like that? `
`Interesting.`
` I like it.`
` I'll kill you.`
` Together with your lover...!"`
`"...If that is the fate that you have decided, that is up to you. `
`......I won't be afraid of that or go against that.`
` Because I don't believe that the severe fate that will start occurring from here on is something controlled by your will.`
` We humans don't know anything about fates that could occur in the future.`
` Therefore, until the last instant, I'll live to the fullest, relying on my own fate and conviction.`
` Fate is just a roll of the dice.`
` You can't feel malice from it.`
` I don't believe that you inspire it."`
`"......Hoh.`
` Even though you have stopped being furniture, you have no fear of death.`
` ......It seems you think that will bore me, but that's a huge misunderstanding.`
` ...My interest will be increasingly satisfied as I see whether you really can stick to that until your last moments.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"It's so frustrating.`
` ......Why did you take the form of a human, appear in front of us, speak with human words, and ridicule us?`
` ...If you hadn't appeared in front of us, if you hadn't predicted the future, `
`......we would have been able to live life to the fullest until the last moment."`
`"That's what witches do.`
` I live off your fates, reigning as a high-order being does over low-order beings.`
` After all, for all of you, fate is just a Fragment.`
` If you make soup with both hands, you can scoop out as much as you want."`
`"......Just like how no matter what the beef cows I raise babble, it won't change whether I invite them to my dinner table.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......We are powerless, so we can't go against your ceremony or fate.`
` ...But I can make you unhappy right now."`
`"Hoh.`
` What would that be?"`
`".........I will walk away from this place right now.`
` Answering your words only entertains you.`
` Not answering your questions is the only way I can resist you."`
`"I see, I see.`
` You may be able to take a shot at me.`
` ...But you cannot defeat me, right?`
` ......I have the power to kill anyone for eternity."`
`".........I can't wait to see whether you can keep up that resistance in an endlessly repeating cycle of death and rebirth.`
`......Don't forget it, alright?`
` You spoke those words yourself.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*"`
`"Well then, if you will excuse me.`
` If you have any business, please call me."`
`Shannon gave a reserved bow, and faced away.`
`...With that gesture, maybe she really had taken a shot back at the witch, just as Beatrice had mentioned.`
`...Because when the witch called out again, she sounded a little more quick-tempered than she had before.`
`"Kanon thanked me.`
` ...Can't you?`
` Can't you thank me for giving you your day of rest?"`
`"Furniture will be happy about their day of rest.`
` But I am a human.`
` So I have nothing to thank you for.`
` ......Do you have any other business?"`
`".........You plan to receive the ring from George?`
` Don't forget that if you do, I will abandon the promise I made with Kanon, the promise that you would not be selected as a sacrifice."`
`"If you have any more business, I'll have someone else come for you.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`A flat-out interruption.`
` Shannon still hadn't answered her.`
` And the sound of the door closing came instead of an answer.`
` It seemed that Shannon's resistance probably struck far more deeply into the witch than Shannon herself thought.`
`...Because an expression of hatred once again rose to Beatrice's face.`
` She had made Kanon submit, even though he hadn't been ensnared until the end.`
` ...And after that, Shannon, who had until now been easily ensnared, refused to submit this time.`
`"............What is this?`
` ...Isn't this interesting after all?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Am I still far too young?`
` This is why I'm still not tired of living after one thousand years..."`
`The most fabulous time in the family conference...`
` That was the dinner.`
` In the past, Kinzo, who had been serious about the family conference, took everyone's yearly gathering for dinner very seriously.`
` Because anything embarrassing that occurred during the dinner would cause the deepest shame for him as the host, `
`he had strongly ordered Natsuhi to sincerely attempt to avoid anything embarrassing.`
` Because of that, she and Krauss had employed Gohda, who had confidence in his cooking abilities.`
`......As a result, even though they could announce a wonderful dinner they had confidence in, `
`by that time, Kinzo had closed himself up in his study and did not appear for dinner. Maybe you could call that ironic...`
` When the main dish for tonight, calf steak, was set out, Gohda began to brag about it, further exciting everyone's appetite.`
`"The sauce here is Bordelaise.`
` Of course, the red wine base I used was excellent even among those made in Bordeaux, but in addition, I prepared an original blend of this house, `
`a blend of choice alcohol from around the world to further deepen the taste.`
` This sauce is limited to this year.`
` It would greatly please me if you were to enjoy yourselves."`
`"...Isn't that wonderful?`
` However, isn't Bordelaise sauce common to French cooking?`
` It almost seems like using alcohol from outside France with that is heresy."`
`"Master.`
` Today is the annual family conference.`
` As a dinner for those who normally live far away, and have traveled far from across the world to gather together,`
` I realized that a sauce made from a blend of fine alcohols from across the world that have never met each other before would be most fitting,`
` so I had it specially prepared."`
`"Wonderful!`
` A truly wonderful cook, that's what you are!`
` Food and medicine work twice as well if you advertise it right!`
` It's twice as delicious as normal food, and the advertisin' makes that twice as good.`
` The taste keeps doublin' and doublin'!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Come on, Nii-san.`
` Didn't he see that question coming?"`
`"There's no mistake.`
` Having Gohda-san handle the truly delicious part."`
`"Is that so?`
` I thought there might be some people here who didn't notice that today's food was in the French style."`
`"......Just now, Eva said that not using butter was a virtue, but that's the Spanish style.`
` ...Well, I guess they do share a border, right?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` Will you please not take a part of the conversation out of context and manufacture something?"`
`"...It's a very delicious sauce.`
` Gohda-san, you certainly are wonderful."`
`"It is a great honor to receive your praise.`
` And this is all thanks to Madam's habitual guidance."`
`"......No, it was all Gohda's idea.`
` I only listened to the recipe and approved of it."`
`It looked like the siblings quickly got into a loud argument about the sauce,`
` ...but for the most part, dinner proceeded peacefully.`
`......However, something that they really wanted to ask about smoldered inside all of their hearts.`
`......And that was the visitor, the 19th person.`
`............The Golden Witch.`
` In actuality, Eva and Rudolf and the rest were cautious during dinner.`
` If the mystery guest was to be introduced, this dinner table was the most appropriate place to do it.`
`...However, no place was prepared at the dinner table for the witch.`
` The family conference would begin in earnest after the meal, and previous experiences told them that it could last until deep into the night.`
`......But they couldn't understand what it would mean if this person, who should be introduced, still hadn't been by late that night.`
` So Eva and Rudolf and the rest began to feel some doubts.`
`......About whether this guest was actually unknown to Krauss as well.`
` If this wasn't an assassin called by Krauss to give him an advantage in the inheritance problem,`
` ...maybe they should speak frankly to Krauss beforehand, and create a common front to resist anything disadvantageous to the four siblings.`
`......If she was Kinzo's assassin, `
`whose purpose was to keep the inheritance from being handed over to the four siblings, `
`the enmity between Krauss and the other siblings could only become a weak point that benefitted the enemy...`
`"Well then, please enjoy at your leisure..."`
`When he finished explaining the table setting and the cooking, Gohda tried to leave the room, but Kyrie called him to a stop with a small voice.`
`"......Yes, Kyrie-sama.`
` What is it?"`
`"Umm, I'm sorry.`
` ......I thought that there was a guest here today, ...but I haven't yet seen them at dinner..."`
`She had planned on saying it nonchalantly, but unfortunately, it reached the ears of Natsuhi, who was sitting in the next seat.`
` It seemed that Natsuhi had heard it as, 'Even though the guests have come, won't the host come to dinner?'`
` ......In other words, that Kyrie had asked whether Kinzo was going to come to dinner.`
`"The head's condition is not good, so he said that he will take his dinner in his study.`
` ......My husband explained that in the beginning, but is something...?"`
`"...............I'm sorry.`
` That's not what I meant."`
`...In an instant, Kyrie realized from Natsuhi's reaction that this unknown visitor was also unknown to Krauss and his wife.`
`.........And what that meant...`
`......On the chessboard placed inside Kyrie's mind, it felt like there was a loud sound as the arrangement of the pieces changed...`
`"A gue-st?"`
`It seemed that Battler, who had been sitting next to Natsuhi, had heard Kyrie's words without misunderstanding them, `
`and thinking it was a question about whether yet another person had been invited to today's family conference, he let out a wild voice.`
` Thanks to that voice, the uncomfortable feeling in the siblings' chests suddenly exploded...`
` Everyone looked at Gohda at the same time.`
`......Judging by their appearances, it was at least obvious that no one here had invited that mystery woman.`
` For an instant, Gohda was startled to find everyone's gazes gathered on him, but because of his naturally vain personality, this actually gave him a feeling of superiority.`
` Therefore, he answered in an extremely calm and graceful manner.`
`"......Yes.`
` Because that person wanted to eat alone in the VIP room, their food was carried over there."`
`Therefore, Gohda's extremely graceful and reasonable response made it obvious to everyone that a 19th person, a visitor, existed...`
`"The VIP room? A guest?`
` ......What, who are you talking about?"`
`Natsuhi's words echoed the question that everyone who didn't know about the visitor, the Golden Witch, was thinking.`
` Gohda was slightly disoriented, as though he hadn't thought Natsuhi would actually question him.`
`......It had been an honored guest spoken of so severely.`
` He hadn't imagined that Krauss and his wife might not have know.`
`"Umm, ......it is Beatrice-sama."`
`"Beatrice!!`
` See, see!`
` Beatrice came, uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`Maria had been telling the other cousins over and over again that she had met Beatrice that day.`
`......The cousins had answered, saying 'Isn't that nice', but they hadn't believed,`
`So, ...their eyes grew wide.`
`"S, sorry.`
` I was sure you were just joking, Maria...`
` S, so, she really was there..."`
`".........By Beatrice, ......you mean that Beatrice of the gold...?!"`
`"Uu-!!`
` Maria has been saying she 'exists' the whole time!`
` No one believes!!"`
`"Sorry, Maria-chan...`
` That's not what we meant..."`
`After learning that everyone had doubted Beatrice's existence, Maria, who had been in a good mood all day, completely lost her temper.`
`...George, who sat in the next seat over, tried frantically to calm Maria.`
`"...Gohda.`
` Is that another bit of dinner entertainment?`
` *cackle*, quite a good performance."`
`".........Aniki.`
` Stop playing dumb.`
` ...You called her, right?"`
`"Called?`
` Called who?`
` ...From where?!"`
`"Nii-san.`
` Let's make this clear.`
` ......Who is that?`
` Surely you aren't going to tell us that it really is the Beatrice from that portrait, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you people are talking about!`
` Gohda, isn't this really a joke?!"`
`"I, I, umm......`
` I was just ordered by Genji-san, umm...!"`
`"Call Genji.`
` Immediately!!"`
`When Natsuhi yelled, Gohda shot out into the hallway.`
` At that time, with the sound of the door being thrown open as a spark, the dinner table was suddenly engulfed in an uproar.`
`"So you say you don't know either, Aniki?`
` Who called her?`
` Was it Father?!"`
`"......I don't know anything about this.`
` It seems that you people believe that I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes, but that is a huge misunderstanding."`
`"Calm down, Krauss nii-san.`
` We are no longer at the stage where we can sound each other out.`
` If you also say that you don't know this mystery person, the situation becomes ridiculous...!"`
`"Hideyoshi-san, won't you be a little more discreet with your words?`
` My husband would not invite unnecessary humans to the family conference."`
`"Seriously.`
` What are you people talking about? `
`Are you saying that the witch of the portrait has broken out of her frame and appeared?!`
` ......There's no way anyone has actually met this witch."`
`"I, met her...!"`
`Eva and Rudolf nodded at Rosa's proclamation.`
`"Uu-!`
` Maria also met her!!`
` Krauss oji-san, belie-ve it!`
` Believe Mama!`
` Uu-uu-!"`
`The brief tension was broken, and Maria also started to make a ruckus.`
`...The room was already chaotic.`
`"I don't have a clue what's going on...`
` So what does it mean?`
` Does it mean that the witch who gave Grandfather the gold is appearing as a special guest in this year's family conference...!"`
`"But..., really...?`
` Rosa oba-san didn't see it wrong, did she...?"`
`"Maria met her too--!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Rosa oba-san, ......are you, sure?"`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Maria and I met her, ......we even talked to her."`
`"......I met her!!`
` That was definitely a witch...!`
` Believe it!!`
` I definitely didn't see it wrong or hallucinate or anything!`
` What, .........was that?!"`
`...In the instant before the typhoon visited...`
`......Rosa had definitely met with the witch.`
` But that scene had been so hard to accept as truth......, `
`the more she spoke of it like this, the less she understood what it was she had met.`
` Ironically, because she had lost her composure and said that she had definitely met the witch,`
` the more desperate she became, the more vague the witch's existence seemed.`
` Because, with that one composed sentence, she had definitely affirmed that existence.`
`".........I also met with her.`
` I greeted, ...well I really couldn't call it that. I exchanged a few words with her.`
` .........It's definitely not something that Rosa-san saw wrong."`
`"Kyrie-san, are you serious...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........But she didn't tell me her name.`
` So I can't conclude that she was Beatrice."`
`"......However, sorry if this is subjective, `
`......but since I met her in the entrance hall, I was able to compare her face with the portrait.`
` ...My first impression was that, she was the subject of the portrait.`
` .........This is all just subjective."`
`"That isn't possible!`
` In the first place, where did that woman come from?`
` That boat will only make the trip to the island to escort everyone there and back.`
` Was she riding on that boat?!"`
`"............`
` There's not much we can say if you ask us that.`
` Of course, I have no memory of that woman getting off the boat with us."`
`"Ooh, really?`
` How can you prove that there wasn't a boat other than the one we rode on?`
` You can't! `
`You can't prove one 'didn't come'!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......You could prove that it 'came'.`
` All you have to do is say that someone saw it.`
` But you can't prove that it 'didn't come'.`
` Even if everyone says that it didn't come - that they didn't see it - you can't deny that it could have 'come secretly'.`
` It's that thing they call the '{c:86EF9C:Devil's Proof}'."`
`It's easy to prove that a devil 'exists'.`
` All you have to do is meet a devil.`
` But it is impossible to prove that devils 'don't exist'.`
` Just by saying that no one has ever met a devil, you can't deny the possibility that they're hiding away somewhere that humans cannot go.`
`......You can't deny the existence of aliens for exactly the same reasons.`
` Until humanity searches the whole of space and can show perfectly that aliens don't exist, you can't be sure that they don't exist.`
` And it's definitely impossible for us to ever check the entirety of space for the existence of aliens.`
`...Therefore, while there may be a number of ways to prove that aliens do exist, it is impossible to show proof that denies their existence.`
`"......In that case, even if we discuss whether a boat separate from the one we rode on came to the island, we would just be wasting our time.`
` ......She wasn't on the boat with us.`
` That much is a fact, and she visited this island through some other means."`
`"That's right.`
` There may be no need to discuss how she came here.`
` The essential point is the fact that she actually is in this mansion now, and doesn't feel like having dinner with us."`
`"Let's review.`
` ...Right now, there is another guest on this island other than the 18 of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that is a guest that even Aniki and Natsuhi-san don't know about, right?"`
`"I don't know...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about...!"`
`"Be silent for a while.`
` Your headache will get worse. `
`......It is as my wife says.`
` I have no idea what you people have been talking about up until now."`
`"Then there can be only one answer.`
` ......Father called her.`
` For today's family conference!"`
`"For the family conference?!`
` Then for what reason?!"`
`"I don't know that!`
` I thought you knew, Nii-san, that's why I thought I'd question you!"`
`"Eva, could you give it a rest?!`
` Krauss nii-san said that he doesn't know! `
`......So this is how it happened.`
` Father stealthily invited the witch of the portrait as a secret guest.`
` And she met with Rosa-san and Maria-chan and then Kyrie-san."`
`".........That's all for now!`
` If she has something to say to us, she could just quickly show herself!`
` The question becomes why she's shut herself up without greeting us."`
`"Does this mean that Father, who never had any interest in the family conference from the beginning, secretly called a new mistress here?`
` And had her wear the clothes of his ideal witch? `
`............This day is too important for us to come to that conclusion."`
`"There can be only one reason.`
` To join in on the family conference.`
` ...She wants to claim some right to Father's inheritance!"`
`"Ridiculous!!`
` The head wouldn't have something as filthy as a mistress!"`
`"I told you to be silent! `
`I've been in this mansion with Father the whole time, and I haven't heard about this once.`
` .........At best,`
` all we can guess is that Father's hidden mistress of several decades ago had a hidden child, `
`......and Father searched her out and called her today.`
` ...Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Dear!`
` Father couldn't have something like that!`
` To waste the noble blood of the Ushiromiya family on a mistress...!`
` This is nothing more than a few people saying that they saw something!`
` It's obviously an illusion, a delusion, a daydream!`
` Or is everyone taking part in some kind of act to trick my husband?!"`
`"What act?!!`
` If anyone is acting, it's you!!"`
`"Quit it Aneki.`
` ......This is a slightly reckless way to say it, but Natsuhi-san is correct.`
` Kyrie saw her, I did not.`
` Neither did you, Aneki.`
` But Rosa did."`
`"......However, that means that she 'exists'.`
` Because there is someone who can prove that she 'exists', we directly conclude that she exists.`
` It is the opposite pattern of the Devil's Proof."`
`".........And I want to meet her too.`
` And I want to ask her directly what kind of business she has with the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I agree with you on that.`
` I truly wish to enquire as to what business she has on Rokkenjima."`
`"Don't say such obvious lies!`
` She is after one thing.`
` It's Father's inheritance!`
` We should polish up any further strategy relating to the inheritance problem with a knowledgeable lawyer.`
` If the mistress claims equal rights as Mother, then our shares will be cut right in half!"`
`".........W, wait a second, everybody!`
` Genji-san will come very soon.`
` He knows everything.`
` I'm sure he will answer our questions!`
` Until then, let's stop talking about this!!"`
`"Hey, kids?!`
` Sorry, but the adults have to start talking about something complicated!`
` Return to the guesthouse!!"`
`Rosa yelled at the children, slightly emotionally.`
` The children didn't understand why they were suddenly being yelled at this time, but Eva and the rest realized it too late.`
` They were talking so grandly about the filthy topic of the inheritance in front of the children.`
`...There was no way that they'd want their children to remain here.`
` So they all immediately agreed with Rosa's plan.`
`"Th, that's right, just as Rosa-san says!`
` George!`
` Take all the cousins and go back to the guesthouse!`
` Play nice with all of them!"`
`"George, do as you're told.`
` Take all of the cousins, and leave right now!"`
`"W, ...wait a second Mother...!`
` We still haven't finished eating...!"`
`"Uu-!`
` And dessert hasn't come ye-t!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`"We will have Gohda-san carry dessert to the guesthouse!`
` So leave!!"`
`"Jessica.`
` From here on, the adults will be talking together.`
` Go."`
`".........U, ...understood.`
` .........Even though I'm still eating..."`
`"...Guess that means I'm not the only exception."`
`"Thank you for understanding, Battler-kun. `
`...But you sure are lucky."`
`"Huh?`
` Why?"`
`"I'd want to leave if I could."`
`"...Ihihihi!`
` That's right.`
` I'll let you adults enjoy your happy family chat about the inheritance."`
`"............I will also leave my seat.`
` Anyhow, it appears that my turn will not come tonight."`
`Nanjo softly rose from his seat.`
`...He had been calmly watching the whole discussion without pointlessly interrupting from his seat in the farthest corner.`
`......His reaction was very adult, like a calm old gentleman.`
` When Nanjo rose from his seat, it urged the other people who were supposed to leave.`
` The children noisily rose from their seats and as they hurried into the hallway, the servants returned.`
`"I apologize for taking so long...`
` I have called Genji..."`
`"......I was checking to see that all of the doors and windows were shut, so it took me some time.`
` My apologies."`
`"Come on! Children, to the guesthouse! `
`Gohda-san, my apologies, but could you carry the children's portion of the dessert to the guesthouse?"`
`"Ha...`
`...Is that what you wish...?"`
`It seemed that Gohda didn't find it interesting to see that the dinner he had worked so hard on had been interrupted like this.`
`...He sent Natsuhi a look as though asking her whether that was really alright.`
`"Do as Rosa-san says.`
` After that, it will not be necessary to set out dessert for us.`
` Try not to approach the dining hall until we call you.`
` Tell that to the rest of the servants too.`
` Alright?"`
`"Y, ...yes.`
` Certainly..."`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Shall we go?`
` Even Maria-san must not trouble her Mother any further."`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!!`
` Maria also talk about Beato-!!`
` No no no, uu-uu-uu-!!!"`
`"Maria-chan,`
` will you tell us about Beatrice in the guesthouse?`
` ...I really want to hear about the witch.`
` Okay?"`
`"Uu-?`
` Uu-!"`
`"......You're really good, George nii-san.`
` I'm moved."`
`"Are you sure you don't have kids?`
` You're too used to this, ihihi!"`
`Maria's mood was completely back to normal at George's words, and she took the initiative, saying that she wanted to go to the guesthouse.`
` It looked like Gohda didn't like being kicked out himself, but he didn't disobey Natsuhi, and left the room with Battler and the rest, closing the door...`
`"......Do you all have some business?"`
`"Yes, we do.`
` A bunch of it.`
` And we all do.`
` So much that we almost want to have a lottery to see who asks the first question."`
`"But no matter who wins the first lottery, the first question will be the same, won't it?"`
`"That's right. `
`.........Genji-san.`
` Answer me honestly.`
` ...This person called Beatrice, who's in the VIP room right now...who is she?"`
