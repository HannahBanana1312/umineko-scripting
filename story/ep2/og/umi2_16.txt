`After Genji finished taking his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.`
` He ate some reheated soup that Gohda had made, along with some random leftovers from the refrigerator.`
` They were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.`
` He had half-heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he had been yelled at by a voice telling him that they had canned food so they were fine, and the door wasn't even opened for him.`
`......So ironically, the servant Genji was able to eat a more delicious meal...`
`......But why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself, `
`even though all of those crimes had been committed, and many people had already met a brutal end?`
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his normal tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal, `
`you might think that all of the horrible events that had happened today were just a dream or an illusion.`
` Was he taking a philosophic view, or was it simply resignation? `
`Genji must have considered it a virtue to systematically carry out his duty until the last moment, `
`since the fate that awaited him was unavoidable.`
` It would probably be impossible to perceive the depths of his heart for all eternity, unless he told of it himself......`
` Because he had given the master key back to Rosa, the places he could go to were extremely limited.`
` All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure that the windows were closed.`
` So he was probably able to go around that route far more quickly than usual.`
`"........................`
`......Hmm."`
`After the sound of a moderate knock, `
`Rosa oba-san, who had been falling into a doze shortly before, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.`
`"Who is it?!"`
`I was napping in a sofa, and that voice also brought me back to reality.`
`"......Rosa-sama.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Do you have some business?`
` We'll be fine without opening the door.`
` Tell us from there."`
`".........Yes.`
` Well then, forgive me for speaking in this fashion. `
`...I have found Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa's corpses."`
`"Wh, ...what did you say...?!!"`
`"............I see.`
` Understood, let's go and check them.`
` ...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anybody."`
`"..............."`
`"......Uu-.`
` It's alright, Battler.`
` If Maria's there, it'll definitely be alright."`
`Maybe my face was shadowed with anxiety.`
`...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand, and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.`
` Since it was Rosa oba-san's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.`
` When I finished, I took a backward glance at Rosa oba-san, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.`
`"Genji-san, where are their corpses...?"`
`".........In the courtyard.`
` I shall guide you."`
`"Battler-kun, wait!`
` Just in case, let's check the doors and windows of this room.`
` Wait a second."`
`Rosa oba-san called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead, and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.`
`......But those locks had already been checked once.`
`......It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might have secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking.`
`...No, maybe Rosa oba-san was right for being this cautious...`
` Even though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in like the rose garden.`
` On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides, `
`it made you feel a little discomfort, as though it was telling you that even if you tried to escape to the outside, you couldn't escape from the mansion.`
` On the other hand, thanks to that, even though the violent winds could be heard, the wind itself was blocked.`
` Genji-san held out an umbrella, but Rosa oba-san ignored him.`
`...She probably wanted to say that the gun took two hands, and it would be dangerous if she took the umbrella.`
` Even without Genji-san pointing his finger, we understood immediately.`
` Right in the center of the courtyard, ......we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san lay...`
` Rosa oba-san entered the courtyard without even opening an umbrella.`
`...So Genji and I also entered the courtyard without opening an umbrella.`
` Only Maria opened her umbrella.`
`"..............., Maria...`
`......Is this, ...that thing?"`
`"......Uu-. `
`......It's the seventh twilight and the eighth twilight."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` Certainly, just as Genji-san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.`
` ......Very sharp.`
` Almost as though they've been sliced with a katana or something..."`
`That gaping wound on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,`
` but after seeing the Halloween party in the chapel, even though I thought it was horrible, it was no longer enough to make me feel sick.`
` More importantly, my gaze fell to their legs.`
` On Doctor Nanjo's knee.`
` On Kumasawa-san's ankle.`
`......Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic decoration.`
`...They must have been the same as the one that had pierced Jessica's back.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's the same as Jessica-chan.`
` Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ceremony, I wonder?"`
`".........I do not know.`
` The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like this.`
` Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."`
`The one that had been stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect, `
`but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa-san's ankle might have been a little shallower.`
` It had come out and fallen over.`
` So, by looking that one that had fallen over, for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife, `
`but something like a stake.`
` Its full length was probably about 30 centimeters.`
` It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.`
` Even without touching it, I noticed that it had some weight to it.`
` It was composed of a grip and a cone-shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.`
` Maybe it seemed like a miniature version of those lances western knights used on horseback.`
` The ditch that had been inscribed in a spiral shape made it also look like a drill.`
`......However, the grip had an occult-like design of a demon or something,`
` so instead of a weapon used in war, `
`it felt like something that would be used in a ceremony to offer up a sacrifice.`
`"......There's no mistake.`
` ...They're meant to be, sacrifices."`
`"......At the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` At the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"Wait.`
` Then, they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` ......C, ......could it be..."`
`That's right.`
` Why is Genji-san alone?! `
`If something like this had happened, why wouldn't George-aniki, Gohda-san, or Shannon-chan be here?!`
` Why was Genji-san alone?!`
`"What is this?`
` Where did George-kun and the other two go?!"`
`".........I was told that they wanted to go to Madam Natsuhi's room to search for something, so they left.`
` They have not returned yet."`
`"What did you say...?`
` Umm, you say they left, when was that?!"`
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe."`
`"N, no way...!!`
` Why didn't something that important, wait, no, ...why didn't you think that was suspicious?!"`
`"......There must always be one servant awaiting orders.`
` It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."`
`Was Genji-san really this much of a robot?! `
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!! `
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san had been killed in this way, which meant that three people had already been killed...!! `
`We ran towards Natsuhi oba-san's room.`
`.........With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.`
` Before we even saw the inside of Natsuhi oba-san's room, `
`...we were imprisoned by a certain resignation.`
` On that door, a bizarre, `
`...scribble, `
`...no, filth...? `
`Anyway, this wasn't a normal situation, and without opening the door, we were able to imagine what was inside that room.`
` On the face of the door, ......how should I say it?`
`......Hands had been heavily painted with the same red paint that the magic circles from before had been drawn with, `
`...and had banged on the door, scratched it, dirtied it.`
`......It was dirtied like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.`
` I didn't know what it could mean.`
`...The bright-red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.`
`"...G, ...Genji-san, please open it."`
`Rosa oba-san held her gun up high and ordered Genji-san to open it.`
` Genji-san approached the door without being particularly troubled by that stuff on it, and turned the knob, `
`but immediately turned around, shaking his head.`
` It was locked.`
` Right now, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will, Rosa oba-san.`
` This time, Genji-san asked Rosa oba-san to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.`
` After making a slightly unhappy face, Rosa oba-san handed me a master key, and told me to open the door.`
`"......Battler-kun, would you open it for me with this?"`
`"Just trusting Genji-san with something like that wouldn't..."`
`Rosa oba-san glared at me with an intense gaze.`
`......Getting into a fight here would only make the environment turn even more sour.`
` Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door, and tried the knob.`
` ......It didn't open.`
` It was definitely the resistance of the lock.`
` I stuck the master key into the keyhole.`
`*clunk*.`
` There was a light resistance.`
` While listening to Rosa oba-san as she told me to take care, I opened the door without taking any particular care.`
` And then, .........there was a scene laid out before us that didn't betray my expectations at all.`
`".....................!`
` H, horrible......"`
`"..............."`
`"As I thought, ......it was a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."`
`".........Uu-."`
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.`
` Drawers were flung open, pulled out, with their contents thrown about, `
`devastated so that it looked nothing like the room of the methodical Natsuhi oba-san.`
` But the thing that caught the eye before that, `
`.........was Gohda-san's corpse lying facedown right in front of the door...`
` Right in the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire, one of those demon stakes from before had been rammed in.`
`......Exactly how far could it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?`
`...Just imagining it would cause anyone's chest to hurt.`
`"...Was gouging the chest, the fifth twilight?"`
`"............Uu-."`
`Maria grabbed my hand.`
`......Her expression looked just like normal, `
`...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three corpses lay.`
` And, along the wall farthest into the room, George-aniki was dead.`
`......This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right in the center of his stomach.`
`...Was gouging the stomach, the sixth twilight? `
`Shannon-chan's corpse was face down in front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.`
` Had she seen her own face in the end, in that horribly broken mirror stained with blood?`
`...Because she was face down, I couldn't see her face, but I could imagine even without seeing it.`
` Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen...`
`......Only the fourth twilight was left.`
` Gouge the head and kill...`
` Maybe my heart was completely tired out and dead...`
` Even though I knew what I was doing was wrong, ...I lifted her head, and checked.`
`......And, I made sure that my guess was right on the mark.`
` There was a gaping hole in Shannon-chan's head, and her insides were dripping out.`
` Not only that, ...you could even see, ...inside her.`
` After seeing that, I finally noticed that what I was doing was wrong.`
` I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.`
`"Hey, Battler-kun!!`
` You must leave everything alone until the police come!!`
` What do you think you're doing, touching it?!`
` What will you do if our precious proof on the scene gets disturbed?!!"`
`Rosa oba-san got violently mad at me, and even tugged at the back of my collar.`
` I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ......and gazed dimly up at the ceiling...`
`"......Maria."`
`"Uu-......?"`
`"......After this, even the eighth twilight is over.`
` ......What was the ninth twilight again?"`
`"..................`
`...At the ninth twilight, the witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive."`
`"I see.`
` ......After this, the Golden Witch Beatrice will be revived.`
` ......What then?`
` ...On the final tenth twilight?"`
`"...At the tenth twilight, the journey shall end, and you should reach the Golden Land.`
` ......Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Very soon."`
`".........The witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive, you say.`
` .........We're going to die?`
` Or is the ceremony of sacrifices over now, ...our journey shall end, and we should reach the Golden Land...?"`
`"........................"`
`"......What is our journey?`
` ......We've spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, spinning our heads as we tried to break out of this situation, `
`...and we haven't gotten anywhere.`
` It's like they say, thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."`
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.`
` ......We said we could only trust dead people, `
`...so that we even came all the way here just to check the deaths of these three with our own eyes...`
`...If we're like this, `
`......why, `
`.........should we make it to the Golden Land......"`
`That's right, ......if nothing could be solved, it would have been much better if we had locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.`
` Grandfather was the wisest of us.`
` He'd been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.`
`......That would have been fine.`
` Grandfather was the most correct...`
`"......It's alright, Battler.`
` ......If you're with Maria, it's alright.`
` .........The witch is very fickle, and she's a terrifying being who maybe kills humans for fun sometimes."`
`"...However, if you're together with Maria, it's alright.`
` So, don't be afraid."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......It's soothing, and I'm happy."`
`After Rosa oba-san finished investigating their deaths, she proclaimed that she would seal this room again,`
` chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she had lent me, and locked the door again.`
` It seemed that George-aniki had been holding the original key to Natsuhi oba-san's room.`
` She had also collected that.`
`............Wait a second.`
` She had all of the master keys in her hand.`
` And if the original key had been shut up inside that room, `
`......wasn't this another closed room? `
`Is this the fourth closed room......? `
`Now that we had been released from our suspicion of those three, we once again returned to the parlor.`
` I don't have a clue what's going on anymore.`
`......If only the dead were safe, and everyone alive was a wolf, `
`......all that was left was me, Rosa oba-san, Maria, and Genji-san.`
`......Only those, Grandfather, and that 19th person, the guest who we hadn't even sensed, Beatrice.`
` 13 people had died, and six were left.`
`......With only six people, how would the wolves and sheep puzzle end...? `
`Even though the puzzle which had had 19 people in it had been reduced to six people, `
`......I couldn't find any answer...`
` We returned to the parlor.`
`......I felt a little anxious that, while we were gone, `
`a creepy magic circle or something might have been drawn on the door to the parlor, `
`but thankfully, there was none...`
`"Thank you, Genji-san.`
` This is far enough.`
` Please rest for the day."`
`"......Certainly.`
` ...Then, if you will allow me to rest."`
`"H, ...hey, Rosa oba-san...`
`......are you saying that you'll leave Genji-san all alone in a situation like this...?"`
`"......That's right.`
` I think it's very dangerous. `
`......But, in that case, why is he safe?`
` After those three headed to Natsuhi nee-san's room, he was alone the whole time.`
` And yet he's safe."`
`"......It's the wolves and sheep puzzle.`
` Why would an isolated sheep be safe in its weakest position?"`
`"...P, ......probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves..."`
`"Wrong.`
` Because it wasn't a sheep."`
`"Are you saying Genji-san's, ...a wolf...?"`
`"He said that he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove.`
` The only ones that could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san's corpses, that could have killed George and the rest, were him and Beatrice, right?"`
`"W, wait, with that argument, anyone-"`
`"......Battler-sama.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"...I believe that trust will be won not with a hundred excuses, but with simple faithfulness.`
` ......Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."`
`".....................Genji-san..."`
`"......Then, we're decided.`
` If you are truly innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.`
` So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."`
`".........After your long years of service, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.`
` ...But please understand about tonight.`
` ...Then, when tomorrow comes, please let us make up again."`
`Genji-san gave his head a small shake.`
`"......Today and tomorrow,`
` I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......If you have any business, please say so at any time.`
` Then, if you will excuse me."`
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.`
` Genji-san bowed deeply, and left down the hall...`
` And we entered the room.`
`...Even though Rosa oba-san still held all of the master keys herself, she thoroughly checked the inside of the parlor again.`
` She opened the curtains, and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.`
` As I watched, ......how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore.`
` If I said anything unnecessary, it would turn into another fight.`
` For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I had waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.`
`......If she couldn't trust anyone but the dead, she could just go around killing everyone with the gun she held in her hand.`
` And then in the end, she'd realize that she herself was the wolf.`
`...And then in the end, she could blast through the head of the final wolf, and the curtain would close on this insane murder theater...`
` As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I had been encamped before, `
`and rudely rested both of my feet on the table...`
`......When I tried to do that, I found something there and stopped moving my feet.`
`".....................`
`.........What is, this...?"`
`Right there, almost as though it was addressed to me, ...was a western envelope.`
` It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One-winged Eagle.`
`...And it was unopened.`
` W, `
`.........wait wait wait wait...`
`...What is, this............? `
`When, who, put it in a place like this......? `
`I had been sitting here the whole time, until I had gone with everyone to check the corpses.`
` And there hadn't been anything.`
`...And when I returned, `
`it was, `
`here.`
`"......It's alright.`
` There was no problem with the locks on the windows.`
` This room is safe."`
`I heard Rosa muttering that...`
`......Wait wait wait wait.`
`...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.`
` We had made sure this room was safe when we exited it.`
` We had checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.`
`...And we had locked it, come back, and the windows were still locked.`
`......Then, wait, who had put this letter here and how......`
` I opened the letter.`
` Two pieces of stationary came out.`
` The first page, ...had a magic circle drawn on it, with something like blood.`
` If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant.`
` And there was writing on the other page.`
`'Are you making progress solving the riddle of the epitaph? `
`Very, very soon, you'll run out of time.`
` The ninth twilight will start very soon.'`
`......There was no mistake.`
`...It was a letter, ...from Beatrice...`
`"...Uu-?`
` ......Battler, `
`......what is that?"`
`"Ah, ......aaah, `
`when we came here just now, `
`...i, it had been set here."`
`"What happened, Maria? `
`.........Huh?!`
` Battler-kun, that letter?!"`
`"W, wait, err!`
` It was set here.`
` Why?!`
` Even though we properly checked to make sure this room was closed!!`
` Why?!`
` Why!!"`
`".................................`
`......Maria, come here."`
`Rosa oba-san closed her eyes just a little, and after silently thinking something, told Maria to come.`
` Maria obeyed her mother's words.`
` As she did, something unbelievable happened.`
` Rosa oba-san pointed the barrel of that gun at me...`
`"Battler-kun, I've concluded that you are the wolf."`
`"W, .........why?!?!"`
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.`
` ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.`
` ...It was for a short time.`
` But the only one who claims to have approached the table and found the letter, is you."`
`"How can you, `
`............wait, th, that's all screwed up!!`
` Why would I put something like this here?!`
` Wait wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!`
` Why are you suspecting me?!"`
`"Because only you could set that letter there!!`
` That's right, this is all a charade!!`
` You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you had just found it.`
` To create the illusion that the witch entered a closed room, set down a letter, and left!!"`
`"............Dumbass..., `
`a, ......are you thinking like that again...?`
` Are you going to doubt me, `
`......because of something like that?! `
`Cut it out!! `
`My dad and everyone else were killed!!`
` Why would I take part in the culprit's scheme?!!"`
`"That's right.`
` Even if you could have received a large amount of money, I don't want to believe that a demon who would sell their own parents exists."`
`"But, ...maybe he exists.`
` No, that's a bad way to say it.`
` ......What if, in your eyes, Battler-kun, Rudolf nii-san and Kyrie-san weren't your parents?"`
`"...Wh, ......whaaa?!?!`
` Think about what you're saying!! `
`Dad is Dad, right?!`
` Of course, I'm not related to Kyrie-san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!!`
` You can't ignore at least that much, you bastard!!"`
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Sto-p i-t!!`
` Uu-uu-uu-!!"`
`"Stop saying uu-uu-!! `
`......I'm sorry, that was a bad way to say it.`
` Of course, Ushiromiya Battler-kun might be Rudolf nii-san's child!"`
`"......But, are you really Battler-kun, Rudolf nii-san's child?!"`
`"What the hell are you talking about?!! `
`If I'm not Battler, then who else do I look like?!"`
`"Including Rudolf nii-san, we've been reunited with you after six years.`
` No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"`
`"Maybe you really aren't Battler, but someone who's snuck in, trying to skillfully steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Can you clearly prove that you are Ushiromiya Battler?!`
` Right here, right now!!!"`
`"Cut it out, damn it!!`
` I am me!`
` Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` If we're going to doubt even that much, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!`
` I'm myself, no one else!!`
` Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, the only one you can trust other than corpses is yourself!!! `
`If you're going to say that much, let me make an objection! `
`George-aniki was dead, and Natsuhi oba-san's room was locked!`
` George-aniki was holding the key to that room, right?!`
` And by now, the only one holding a master key is you, Rosa oba-san, right?!`
` Weren't you the only one who could have unlocked that room?!?!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this. `
`You're in contact with the real culprit,`
` and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"`
`"I didn't do something like that!! `
`See, there are five of them here, right?!"`
`"As if that matters!!`
` You could have had them set it in a pre-arranged spot, and collected it, right?!!`
` And weren't you the one who said it was suspicious whether there were really five master keys?!"`
`"So how are you saying that someone other than yourself set that letter there?!! `
`As long as you can't prove that, you are a wolf!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuup!! `
`Then why don't you show me some proof, `
`how do you say the culprit killed George-aniki and the rest in that closed room?!`
` How did they lock it?!!"`
`"That's exactly right! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual! `
`{p:1:The door and the windows were locked from the inside. `
`{p:1:There is no fraud or trick, there is no means of secret passage and no hidden place! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and the inside of the room was closed off. `
`{p:1:Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them! `
`{p:1:And let me say this, the parlor's the same. `
`{p:1:The original key to the parlor is sealed in the servant room. `
`{p:1:So unlocking it without the master key is impossible! The definition of a closed room is the same as always!"`
`"Come on, now there's only one suspeeeeect, `
`or are you still playing innocent, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer?!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuup!! `
`You stay silent tooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`"You're the one who's staying silent, how do you say the letter was set here by someone other than yourself?!`
` As long as you can't prove that, you're a wolf!!"`
`"If I can be suspected, then you can be suspected, you try showing me some proof, `
`wasn't the first person to enter the room and begin checking the windows you, Rosa oba-san?!"`
`"Then you anticipated that I would return to the place I had been sitting, and secretly placed the letter.`
` I can also suspect that this is your trap, right?!"`
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!!`
` If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!"`
`"That's no reason!! `
`Maybe, because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria, you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap!!"`
`"All of the master keys are in your hands!`
` So this place and the room just a while ago, are all your doing, aren't they?!!`
` If you can talk your way out of this, then let me hear your excuse!!"`
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start, Rosa oba-san!`
` Why is it that even though six adults in the family conference were killed, only you were the exception, Rosa oba-san?`
` Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"`
`"There can only be one reason, you invited Dad and the rest there and killed them!!`
` Damn it, damn it, `
`that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me, `
`stop saying things that don't make seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense!!"`
`"Uuuuu----!!`
` Sto-----p iiiiiiiiit!!`
` You mustn't fiiiight!! `
`Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` It's no one's fault!`
` It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!!`
` The witch did all of this!`
` It was done with magic!!`
` It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!!`
` Uu-uuuu---!!"`
`Maria thrust herself in between Rosa oba-san and me as the blood started rising to our heads.`
` I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses.`
`...I had acted shamefully just now.`
` My eyes filled with tears.`
`"......That's right...`
`......It's all, `
`.........the witch's fault, isn't it......!!`
` All this about keys and tricks and alibis......, `
`all of it, all of it was stupid!!`
` Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as humans...!!`
` Right, Rosa oba-san, from the beginning, there wasn't a human culprit, it was all the work of the witch."`
`"So there's no way you're the culprit,`
` and there's no way Maria, Genji-san or I am the cuplriiiiit!!`
` Why has it come to this?!!`
` Why am I screaming with Rosa oba-san, ...who I loved?!`
` Why am I having this fight, `
`......with the kind aunt who I loved?!"`
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!`
` I'm not going to doubt my aunt, I'm not going to doubt anyone,`
` it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of Beatrice, `
`it's all, all a crime that Beatrice committed with magic!!"`
`"Beatriiiiiiiice, please, show yourself here, `
`and confess to us that you did everything, `
`I'm sorry already, I'm sorry for doubting each other like this!!"`
`"So forgive us, `
`release us, `
`release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other's deaths!!`
` Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!`
` I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!`
` You definitely exist, it's your victory!!"`
`"Show yourself, ooooooooooooooooooohhh, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice! `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`".........Am I, ...............still, ...alive?"`
`Apparently, some time ago, Kinzo had fallen into a doze.`
` He searched for his spectacles, and looked at the clock.`
`......It was 10:00 P.M.`
`"...That person's ceremony, let's see, how far has it progressed?`
` ............It must have progressed quite far by this time."`
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair, ......and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.`
`".........Beatrice.`
` Very soon, ......I will be able to be reunited with your smile.`
` ............It doesn't matter if I die!`
` If I can just see your smile one more time, I will not regret this life!`
` So, `
`...in the afterliiiife, let me, `
`......meet with you one more tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime...`
` Then, let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooo......`
`......But I won't let you escape!! `
`You are mine!!`
` From your hair to your toenails, to the dirt under your toenails, you are mine!! `
`Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!`
` I won't let you escape, this time you won't slip from my hands!!`
` I'll make you mine for all eternity!!! `
`I will never let you escape a second time, `
`I will never let you escape a second time!!"`
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees, ...as he shook and scraped at the wall...`
`...In an instant, he had started sobbing.`
`"............Whaaaa, hic..., `
`that's wrong, `
`I didn't want to say something like thiiiiis, Beatriiiiiiiiice...`
` Please, `
`......let me meet you one more time...`
` Even if you only let me apologize......`
` Whaaaaaaa, Beatriiiiiiiiiice, `
`...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauaauauau...!!"`
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was mistaken...!`
` If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else...`
` I made a mistake, I made a mistake about that, `
`......I did something that cannot be taken back...!"`
`"In atonement, I offer all that remains of my life...!!`
` In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my crimes, `
`.........I offered, `
`......everything......... `
`......Please, even if it is as I die...`
`............At least, `
`............Let me, `
`apologize, ...`
`......just once...e......`
` Beatriiiiiiiiice......`
` Whaaaa, hic, aaaaaaaah, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"`
`......As Kinzo shook and cried, behind his small back, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere, like flake of gold leaf, and softly fell down...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
` Do you think a woman exists who would fall for a man's tears.........? `
`Well, ......even if it wouldn't make a human woman fall for you, ...it might for a woman who is not human.`
` Kinzo.`
` Do you remember......? `
`That musical piece of chess you played with me, which was still ongoing......? `
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.`
` It was as it had been during the game he had played with Nanjo until yesterday.`
`...After removing the chessboard to mow off all the pieces, he began to line the pieces up one by one.`
`...It was the setup for an ongoing game.`
`".........That's right. Like this.`
` ............I advanced my queen.`
` ...That was a very spectacular move.`
` That move might have been a little too intense for you.`
` .........I worried about whether you would throw away your piece or not, `
`......I kept worrying............"`
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.`
`......Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there, `
`......and he would be able to restart this game again...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
` You want to apologize?`
` You want to see my face again?`
` You want to make my smile an eternal thing? `
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word? `
`Even though that is the sole element of the world.........`
` At that time, Kinzo muttered.`
`......A prayer?`
` An entreaty?`
` .........It was probably best to just call it muttering.`
`"......I, .........love you... `
`......Beatrice............"`
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...`
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo.`
` If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...`
` Know that those words could never cause a woman to fall for you.`
` That's right, ...unless there's a miracle.`
` So this is, .........`
` At that time.`
` .........Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, with a different tempo than those of the servants.........`
`".........Who are you?"`
`The woman beyond the door, ......didn't answer.`
`"......I'm asking who you are!!`
` Will you not answer?!!"`
`The woman beyond the door, `
`......didn't answer.`
`"Could it be, `
`............oooooh, `
`......could it be......`
` B, `
`......Beatrice?`
`.........Beatrice, `
`.........Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"`
`The woman beyond the door, ......answered.`
` At the ninth twilight, the witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive.`
