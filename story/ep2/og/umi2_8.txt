`...Hideyoshi's claim that advertising doubled the taste was apparently right.`
` The kids and Nanjo, who had been chased out to the guesthouse, had gathered in the cousins' room,`
` and were eating the cake that Kumasawa had brought there for dessert.`
` It was both wonderful and high-class, with lavish amounts of cream and decorated deliciously with fruits, `
`but even though it was delicious, for some reason it didn't taste quite as good...`
`"Haha, without Gohda-san's advertising, it doesn't taste nearly as good."`
`"Even if we wanted advertising, Kumasawa-san'd just say that it's made out of mackerel."`
`"Uu-?!`
` Really?!`
` You can make cake from mackerel?!"`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho.`
` Yes, yes, this cake too, if you cook with the squeezed juice of mackerel mixed in with flour and eggs, it comes out all fluffy.`
` Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho."`
`"That would be incredible if true.`
` Maybe mackerel cake will show up on the new menu at Father's store."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Because mackerel is full of nutrients and has a healthy image.`
` It'll be really popular with women and old people!`
` But I'm not gonna get anywhere near it!"`
`"Girls won't eat something that weird."`
`"Even old people would wish to decline."`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho!`
` But it's delicious?"`
`Kumasawa was really raising the mood with the mackerel jokes that were her specialty.`
`...But no matter what happened, the sound of the downpouring rain focused their concern on the mystery guest.`
` In the end, they ended up showering Maria with questions again, since she was the only person here to have met Beatrice.`
`".........I can't believe, ...that story was true."`
`"From the way you say that you didn't believe, it sounds like this isn't the first time you've heard of this witch Maria says she met."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I thought it was a pretty common fairy tale for people of that imaginative age."`
`"Exi-sts!!`
` Beatrice 'exi-sts'!`
` Every year, when we come to the family conference, she meets with Maria, and we play together!"`
`"That's right.`
` Although Beatrice-sama doesn't usually show herself, `
`I hear that she sometimes unexpectedly does so before honest people with clean hearts.`
` Hoh-hoh-ho."`
`Beatrice was a name which referred to the being in that fairy tale about the Rokkenjima witch.`
` Because the family and the servants publicly accepted the image of the witch of Kinzo's delusions to keep him in a good mood, `
`the Rokkenjima fairy tale, or maybe ghost story, was formed...`
` To the family members who knew those details, the fairy tale of the Golden Witch was only a vague thing.`
`...However, in front of Kinzo, they hadn't been able to say that.`
` So those who didn't know the details`
`...like young Maria, for example, it definitely wasn't vague, ...but a real legend of the witch.`
` So Maria believed in the legend of the witch.`
` She swallowed the story.`
`...That was natural for an imaginative girl who believed in witches.`
` So no one said anything to betray her dream.`
`...On the contrary, they had arranged things beforehand to get her excited about her dreams.`
`"...So even though Maria-chan was showing off to us that candy which she said the witch gave her,`
` ...I thought that somebody had probably slipped a candy into Maria-can's handbag."`
`".........I have also acted in such a way two or three times, long ago, `
`secretly placing sweets somewhere. `
`...Probably, Kumasawa-san too, no, all of the servants and all of the Ushiromiya family have done it once or twice."`
`"......So, if it will make a small, innocent kid happy, you sometimes plan it beforehand and place some sweets somewhere. `
`......Come to think of it, I'll bet you do that kind of thing all the time, right, George-aniki?"`
`"............Who knows."`
`Admitting that would probably be unrefined.`
` George admitted it while being extremely wary that Maria didn't find out.`
`"In other words, ......it's kinda like Santa Claus.`
` To protect a kid's dreams, the parents plot together and lie, setting presents at the bedside of a child fast asleep."`
`"......I want to protect a kid's dreams.`
` ...Although I knew that Santa obviously didn't exist a long time ago.`
` ......If it's a dream you don't need to be disillusioned of, I wanted to believe it my whole life."`
`"...Because they know that the world is tough,`
` ...adults want to at least protect a child's clean dreams.`
`"Uu-!!`
` Beatrice exists!`
` 'Exiiiists'!!!"`
`"Yes, she does.`
` Beatrice-sama does exist, right? `
`Some time ago, when I was drying mackerel to make some black tea, unexpectedly..."`
`"......Well, it's something like this.`
` ...Supposedly, at least."`
`"In short, `
`......except for Maria, it's a witch that supposedly no one believed in."`
`"Those words don't quite explain it.`
` ......It's not that we didn't believe.`
` Everyone was trying to make her believe."`
`So this was about not betraying a child's innocence.`
` But Santa doesn't exist in reality.`
` If you don't want them to be all disappointed when they learn that, you should just not show them that dream in the first place.`
`...Did I think like that because I was still a long way from becoming a full adult? `
`Battler was finally getting an idea about the true form of the Rokkenjima witch.`
`.........But in the current situation, that understanding had been revised,`
` and that premise had been turned upside down...`
`"......That's what we thought we knew, but the witch Beatrice-sama actually appeared.`
` Is that what this is?"`
`"Furthermore, judging from our parents' uproar, it looks like she wasn't an invited guest.`
` ......That sounds kinda interesting."`
`"There actually is no basis to say that a woman called Beatrice doesn't exist.`
` ......It's what Rudolf oji-san called a Devil's Proof.`
` ......None of us knew that a woman calling herself Beatrice existed."`
`"...But that doesn't necessarily mean we can deny the possibility that Beatrice exists."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, you've been friends with Grandfather for a long time, right?"`
`"...............`
`...At one point, I heard a lot about it at the family conference from Krauss-san and the others.`
` ......A story that, long before that time, perhaps Kinzo-san had a mistress, and a hidden child with her."`
`"I see.`
` Our parents' heads are full with the distribution of the inheritance.`
` So it's obvious that if the daughter of a mistress showed up, it'd be troublesome for them."`
`"Krauss-san and the rest probably asked Genji-san about it first.`
` However, Genji-san has sworn loyalty to Kinzo-san as his right-hand man, ...and is probably a more trusted friend to Kinzo-san than myself.`
` ......Genji-san probably didn't say anything.`
` ......So next, they went to ask me as his old friend..."`
`"And?`
` ......So, `
`......did Grandfather have a mistress called Beatice, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"............He did.`
` ...No, I have never met her.`
` ...However, I have heard from Kinzo-san that he had a relationship with a woman like that.`
` .........He said that she passed away a very long time ago."`
`"......She's dead.`
` ......And did she have a child with him?"`
`"That, I do not know.`
` ......But Kinzo-san always says that he is researching how to revive Beatrice.`
` ...Usually, if one loses a mistress and has a child left from them. they pour all of that love on that child.`
` ......Therefore, we naturally thought that there wasn't a child between Kinzo-san and Beatrice..."`
`"............Yeah?`
` ....In other words, that also makes for a Devil's Proof."`
`"......It does.`
` ......It's impossible to prove that a child between him and a mistress 'didn't exist'.`
` ......So now that she's actually appeared, we have to assume that she does 'exist'."`
`"That's a bit of a rushed argument.`
` ......It's more realistic that someone caught wind of the trouble with the Ushiromiya family inheritance problem,`
` knew about Grandfather's relationship with a mistress long ago, `
`and impersonated her, trying to get something out of the inheritance problem."`
`"......It is realistic.`
` ...However, we can't deny the possibility that she really is a hidden child, `
`who lived in isolation, forgotten by Grandfather, and who's returned for revenge, right...?"`
`"Revenge?!`
` What do you mean?!"`
`"Aaah, sorry, sorry... `
`Guys just like to embellish things to make them sound interesting.`
` I've seen too many weird dramas.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`Normally, that should have been a light joke.`
`......But it had come when a mystery guest calling herself Beatrice, who no one had invited,`
` had marched in on the day of the family conference, when the bloody argument which the inheritance distribution had become was being discussed.`
`.........There was no way that Battler's joke would be welcomed with laughter.`
` So it was a really big help when Nanjo laughed energetically to calm everyone down.`
`"Hah-hah-hah-ha...`
` I see, I see, that does sound quite interesting.`
` I should love to read a novel with a plot like that."`
`"Well, I don't think that could actually work.`
` ......After all, right now, on this island, there's one, two, three..., 18 people, right? `
`If they did something weird, they'd immediately be caught.`
` And thanks to the typhoon, they can't even leave the island.`
` In other words, it really doesn't look like some crazy crime is gonna happen."`
`"......I agree.`
` In a dead-end, without any way to escape, and in a situation where everyone is suspicous, `
`I really don't think they could pull off a terrifying revenge drama like that."`
`"Probably.`
` ...In that case, it would be more realistic if she had come in secret, without showing herself.`
` You do not often hear about people appearing openly for revenge except in historical plays."`
`"I don't get it.`
` Revenge is based on emotion, not logic. `
`Even if that's misplaced, maybe she isn't really afraid of the police or the number of people or that there's no way out."`
`"It's alright, Jessica-chan.`
` Nothing as horrible as we imagine will happen."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Like the battle royal between our parents over the inheritance isn't horrible."`
`"......That's right.`
` ...Dad and Rudolf-oji-san are pretty tough, and Eva oba-san's even trained in the martial arts.`
` ......It's alright.`
` Yeah..."`
`Jessica didn't say it, but she had vaguely noticed that her own father opposed all of the other siblings regarding the inheritance.`
` They acted like everything was good in front of the children, but when that pretense was lifted away, like it had been at dinner, it would become a tumultuous uproar.`
` It was only natural that Jessica, realizing that, `
`would be frightened that her father and mother had gotten into some kind of trouble, `
`...and were about to be sacrificed for something terrifying...`
`"Seriously.`
` George-aniki's right.`
` ...Nothing's gonna happen.`
` Even if she pretends that she's a witch, `
`what can a single human woman who can't even use magic do?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`The sudden, creepy laugh made all of us jump.`
`......And when we realized that this strange laugh was coming from Maria, we were shocked again.`
`".........That's right.`
` ...Battler, that's what you think, isn't it?"`
`"Wh, .........what is?`
` Don't laugh all creepy like that."`
`"You accept Beatrice's existence for now.`
` At least you accept her as the 19th person and a guest. `
`............But that's all, right?`
` ...You don't accept that the 19th person, Beatrice, is a witch, right...?"`
`"If I think about what I'm suddenly saying, `
`......that's probably right.`
` Witches couldn't exist.`
` It's impossible for it to be anything other than a human woman pretending to be one."`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Hmmm...?`
` Isn't that odd, Battler?`
` ......That's a Devil's Proof, right?`
` ......Witches couldn't exist?`
` But just because Battler's never met a witch, `
`doesn't mean you can deny that witches exist, right...?"`
`"............`
`.........That's right.`
` ...That really is right.`
` I can't prove that witches don't exist.`
` ......However, even if I can't prove it, I can claim it.`
` I claim that witches don't exist."`
`"Why...?`
` Why can you claim that witches don't exist even though you can't prove it...?"`
`"Because things like that don't exist."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` So, that's QED?`
` You're finished proving it without any evidence or basis?`
` Setting aside your own superficiality is typical of the ignorant.`
` A reckless suspension of thought.`
` Kihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"In that case, I have one answer, Maria.`
` ......The witch's side has to show some proof themselves.`
` This is another Devil's Proof.`
` ......If you bring one, it'll be over quickly."`
`"...In that case, this woman calling herself Beatrice`
` would only have to display some wonderful, magnificent magic like the twinkling stars.`
` She would only have to show us something that's impossible for humans, `
`right?"`
`"......Come now, you two.`
` Please settle down..."`
`Kumasawa noticed that the atmosphere between them was getting worse, and tried to calm them.`
`...It seemed as though Battler quickly realized that he wasn't acting like an adult.`
` But Maria's expression didn't loosen.`
`......As she laughed creepily, she kept staring at Battler...`
`"You quit it too, Maria.`
` ...Let's get back in a good mood, alright?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi, kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"..............."`
`"......If that's what you want, Beatrice will definitely show you.`
` Something impossible for humans.`
` When she does, you will believe too, right?`
` About Beatrice."`
`"............Sure.`
` ......If she lets me have a look, I'll believe."`
`"It's a chess argument between the witch and you, Battler.`
` .........If you get checkmate, you will believe in the witch."`
`"Oh, that's a stylish analogy.`
` ......The witch shows her magic.`
` My king is put into check. `
`I quibble, saying that it would be possible to reproduce that by measures even a human could take, and my king escapes.`
` ...And since if I couldn't do that, it'd be checkmate, that's a pretty good analogy."`
`"Battler.`
` ......In chess, you and your opponent have pieces which move in the same way.`
` So you can predict your opponent's moves.`
` ............But you know what?`
` You haven't supposed that your opponent's pieces might be able to move in much more strange ways than yours.`
` You've simply assumed that, since witches shouldn't exist, the movements of Beatrice's pieces will obviously be the same as your own."`
`"....................."`
`"......But you know what?`
` .........Sorry Battler, but your chess partner isn't human.`
` She's a witch.`
` ......She can move her pieces in ways that humans can't.`
` .........Right now, your knowledge is wrong.`
` ...Battler, you like Kyrie oba-san's chessboard thinking, right?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` I like that style of thinking where you stand in your opponent's position."`
`"And that's useless.`
` Even though your opponent is a witch, you won't accept that.`
` .........So you can't understand the moves a witch can make, and your chessboard thinking won't work.`
` Your knowledge of your opponent is wrong.`
` The very first premise of chessboard thinking is broken down."`
`"..................Ooh,`
` ...is that what you say?"`
`"You cannot win in chess against a witch...!`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
`"...I do not know what happened after that.`
` We servants were ordered not to approach the dining room..."`
`".........I see.`
` So, Shannon, have you ever met this person called Beatrice before?"`
`"..................`
`......I don't know."`
`That was a slightly odd way to say it.`
` I thought it didn't sound like she meant her memory was vague.`
`"......For us servants, Beatrice-sama is another master of this mansion.`
` ......Some say something like we were influenced by the Master and spread that rumor...`
`......but since the time I started working here, the story of Beatrice-sama was already whispered about."`
`"I heard about it before.`
` ...There was a servant who didn't respect her, was cursed, and actually had an accident."`
`"Yeah...`
`......but it's true that some people believed more or less than others.`
` ...I, umm, ...believe that respect for that sort of thing shouldn't be forgotten, so I have never doubted that she exists.`
` ......I dimly believed that a, `
`...umm, ......uncertain being called the Golden Witch surely existed."`
`"...And then that witch whose existence was uncertain actually showed herself and appeared openly from the entrance hall..., is that what happened?"`
`".........I don't know.`
` ............I don't know, ...anything."`
`"............`
`...When you brought her dinner, did you talk about anything?"`
`"........................`
`......No, nothing."`
`"I see.`
` ...Still, a witch that eats food somehow doesn't sound so realistic.`
` Maybe it's just someone who knows about the witch legend on this island taking on Beatrice's name after all."`
`".........I think that you've probably come to respect Beatrice and think of her as something like a guardian god of the mansion.`
` So when a person appeared actually calling themselves that, maybe you were a little disturbed."`
`".........`
`.........That's right.`
` I'm sure that might be the case."`
`George was slightly at a loss at what to do about Shannon's downcast appearance.`
`......Possibly, `
`not just Genji, but the young servants had also been strictly questioned about whether they had a clue as to who this person called Beatrice was...`
` Thinking that, he tried to somehow cheer her up.`
` Like Maria and Jessica, `
`Shannon also had surely been unable to completely hide her agitation over the sudden visit of a person calling herself the Golden Witch.`
` He thought that must be the case.`
`...But George probably had no technique of looking into Shannon's heart.`
` Shannon was bitter and sad.`
`......The door to the Golden Land, had been opened.`
`......The witch had definitely told her that.`
` That meant, the demise of everything.`
`.........Even if she accepted the ring from George, `
`............now, they could never be married.`
` No, in the first place...`
`...Did furniture like her, ......have the right to be married? `
`Even if the witch hadn't come to tell of their demise, ......wasn't it fated to fail sometime or another? `
`Had she turned her gaze towards the fun days with George, ...and purposefully closed her eyes to the sad reality?`
`"............What's wrong?`
` ...You really haven't looked well for a while now."`
`"George-san.`
` ......What does it mean, ...to be engaged?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Ah, ......err! `
`It means making a promise to marry.`
` ...But I think that means it's the same thing as marriage.`
` ......Honestly, I want to take you as my wife right now, and take you back home.`
` ......But right now, I am in the middle of training, and I'm still a long way from gaining the ability needed to create my own castle.`
` That's why I want to stick out my chest for the first time since becoming an adult and take you home with me."`
`"I'm not talking about the distant future.`
` I just want you to wait a short three years.`
` ......But that doesn't mean I want to lie about our feelings for another three years."`
`"So, ......I decided to give you an engagement ring.`
` ......That might be a shameful reason as a man.`
` An engagement because I want you to wait, because I can't balance a wife and a job, might be shameful. `
`......But I will definitely-"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` ...I understand that to you, George-san, this engagement ring isn't just another present you would give to a lover."`
`"Th, that was sudden.`
` An engagement ring isn't a simple accessory.`
` It's an oath between lovers, an honored promise left in the form of a ring."`
`".........*giggle*.`
` ...In that case, if we get married quickly, it would become unnecessary, right?"`
`"Th, then it won't be an engagement ring.`
` I'll give it to you as a wedding ring.`
` ......Either way, it won't change the fact that I'll give you a ring."`
`"So it's a sales contract, like saying 'This woman is mine, nobody touch her'."`
`"Nn, ......, no, umm, ......that's not what I......`
`............*cough*."`
`George knew about his shameful character.`
` When he had been captivated by Shannon, and sworn to become an excellent man, he had sworn to throw away the shameful part of himself.`
`......So, even if it was on purpose, he chose to answer a little roughly.`
`...He believed that that would be reassuring to Shannon.`
`".........No, ...that may be true.`
` .........Sayo. `
`I'll make you my wife.`
` ...I won't give you to anyone else.`
` I'll make you all mine.`
` ...So no one will lay a hand on you.`
` ......That's what this ring is.`
` ...Without a doubt."`
`"Thank you very much, George-san.`
` ............I'm truly, happy."`
`Then, George-san.`
`......If it was decided by fate that this engagement ring, ......that this promise would not be fulfilled, ......would you still give it to me...?`
`...Shannon tried to ask that, ...but she swallowed her words.`
` Because George had already spoken the answer.`
`......George had said it.`
` He had said that to him, an engagement ring was infinitely similar to a wedding ring.`
` Therefore, accepting George's ring had a far more sacred significance than a promise to marry.`
`"Therefore.`
` ......I will stop calling this an engagement ring. `
`From now on, this isn't an engagement.`
` It's a wedding ring."`
`"I, ...is that alright...?`
` Is it alright to, umm, just proclaim that we're married without God's blessing......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's enough to tell God, Father, and Mother about it afterwards.`
` We'll claim that we are married.`
` ..........No one can cover that up."`
`".........George-san......"`
`"I'm not saying this because of a momentary emotion.`
` I'm not just looking at how you are now.`
` .........I'm looking at the you of tomorrow, of the next day.`
` ...I'm even gazing at you as you'll be in old age, in the future, as I say this."`
`"......You are always talking George-san.`
` ...About how you want to spend your old age slowly, surrounded by healthy children and grandchildren."`
`"Yeah.`
` At that time, an older you will be beside me.`
` That is what I say, no, what I foresee.`
` ...Yes.`
` Because that day will surely come."`
`".....................Will it, `
`...surely come?`
` .................."`
`"Yes.`
` Surely.`
` Definitely.`
` ......And this ring proves it without words."`
`"............Please, `
`......show me."`
`"Huh? `
`Ah, `
`ah, `
`ah, `
`.........h, h, here it is...!"`
`George, thinking he was being told to show her the ring, hurriedly took out the ring box.`
`...Even though he had practiced so much, he hadn't been able to look cool.`
` But Shannon wasn't looking at that.`
`......In her straight and direct gaze were vague tears and a smile.`
`.........She concentrated her eyes on George's eyes, ...no, on something she could see beyond his eyes...`
`"......Please, `
`............show me, `
`............that future."`
`"Y, ............, yeah.`
` ......I'll show you.`
` Surely.`
` ......I promise.`
` .........And not just until old age.`
` ...After we die too.`
` ...Even if we become spirits, we'll always, always be together."`
`Shannon wiped away her tears and took the ring box.`
` Inside was a diamond ring worthy of blessing the two of them.`
` George said the line that he had practiced over and over again inside his head.`
`"I, ......I want you to put that ring on, whatever finger you like, and have that be your answer. `
`Umm, so, by tomorrow morning......"`
`"......*giggle*."`
`Shannon smiled, took the ring, `
`......and with a completely natural movement, put it on the ring finger of her left hand.`
` It really had looked, ......like a very, very natural movement,`
` and for a while, George was stunned...`
`"This, is my answer.`
` George-san."`
`"Shannon......, `
`no, `
`.........Sayo............"`
`"......Even if we become spirits, `
`.........we'll always, `
`............always......, `
`be together.`
` .........George-san."`
`There was no blessing from God, no pastor to witness, nothing.`
` But the two who were married, proclaimed it.`
`...Two souls were joined here today.........`
`"...............Nee-san, ............you're an idiot."`
`"......Is that so?"`
`"Even though you're furniture...... `
`......Even though...you're furniture......!"`
`"I'm not furniture.`
` Not anymore."`
`"......Liar!!`
` Why are you fooling yourself?!`
` Even though you know that you can never become human!`
` Even though you know that you can never become human unless you go to the Golden Land!!`
` ......Even so, why did you throw away your promise to go to the Golden Land...?!!"`
`"Oh yeah.`
` By accepting the ring, ......that promise with Beatrice-sama comes to nothing, doesn't it?`
` ......*giggle*, sorry."`
`"............From now on, I, you, George-sama, the Master, everyone, everyone has the same conditions.`
` 13 people will be made sacrifices.`
` Only five people will be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......And you, `
`......rejected one of those places yourself......"`
`"That's odd.`
` ......It looks like you're the one with regrets, Kanon-kun."`
`"You're the one with regrets, aren't you, Nee-san!`
` You got engaged, right?!`
` Even though you knew it was a fate that would never be fulfilled!!"`
`"Yes.`
` I promised that we would always, always be together, for eternity. `
`......So you know what?`
` ......In that instant, our eternity was completed.`
` Even if we become sacrifices, it's already completed.`
` So, it's alright."`
`".........Kanon, you're the one who actually has regrets.`
` ...We're furniture, right?`
` No matter what the result, we will be freed.`
` ...In that case, it doesn't matter whether we go to Golden Land or not.`
` ......And yet you are set on going to the Golden Land.`
` .........You want to become human no matter what, right?`
` ...Why?"`
`"Because I want to become human!!`
` I've had enough of being furniture!!"`
`"Why?"`
`"I also, wanted to fall in love...!!!"`
`Tears were coming from both of Kanon's eyes.`
`...And he howled.`
`"......I, liked Milady...!!`
` And after seeing Milady on that day, I started liking her even more...!`
` And when I heard that Milady also liked me, I was really happy...!!`
` But I'm furniture, ......and I can't accept Milady's feelings!!"`
`"...You're wrong.`
` .........We may be furniture.`
` We may be less than human.`
` ...But that doesn't mean that we aren't qualified to love."`
`"I believed that if those thoughts would never be fulfilled, it was better without them!!`
` I just decided that someday, a day would come when I would disappear, and that would definitely hurt her, .........no, that's wrong!!`
` I was just frightened!!`
` I, ......was just afraid, that if the love could not be eternal, it was better without it!!"`
`"......Cicadas, even though their lives last only a few weeks, fall in love and disappear.`
` .........There are no cicadas that don't fall in love because it will be over in a few weeks."`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon was still speaking of his regrets, but by now it was all jumbled up in his crying voice...`
`"......That witch is detestable...!!`
` ...Why did she plant these feelings in me...?!`
` If only, if only she hadn't done that weird prank, I wouldn't have payed Milady any notice...!!!"`
`"............Beatrice-sama is detestable.`
` ...To make you cry bitter tears, she played games with your fate. `
`.........But, the witch's expectations are probably off.`
` ...After all-"`
`Knowing love isn't a regret that ties you to life.`
` It is the place we should reach on our journey through life...`
` Well now, Kanon.`
` That promise you worked so hard for has now come to nothing.`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Well now.`
` With this, the conditions for all of the pieces is the same.`
` There are 18 pieces! 13 will be offered as sacrifices! `
`Who will the five that remain alive be?`
`............And.`
` Will someone destroy this ceremony? `
`Who?!! How?! `
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`This isn't a chess problem.`
` It's a game on equal footing.`
` I won't be closing in one-sidedly.`
` You can frantically run from my advances, and make it a tie, an invalid match.`
` Well, the best you can do is have this repeat on and on.`
` And it probably won't be that difficult for you.`
` However, this invalid match will continue forever, will eventually wear down your mind, and eventually kill it.`
` At that time, you will accept your defeat and surrender to me!! `
`The reason I said it was a fair game.`
`......That is because the rules for my loss have also been established.`
` There's nothing as boring as a game you can't lose, right? `
`A way to defeat me.`
` That is, the epitaph offered to my portrait.`
` That is both the way to open the door to the Golden Land and the key to destroying my ceremony.`
` I follow the epitaph and complete the ceremony.`
` You solve the riddle of the epitaph, destroy the ceremony and overthrow me...! `
`Solve the riddle hidden in the epitaph, and expose the location of the vast gold I gave to Kinzo!! `
`What result will this game show us?! `
`I'm expecting a good fight, alright? `
`Entertain me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!`
`"........................"`
`"............I have no objections.`
` ...Natsuhi and I acknowledge it."`
`".........Ggh......`
`...I can't believe it, ...and I don't want to, but...`
`......that is, ......the truth, isn't it..."`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Choose your words more carefully.`
` .........She is this family's most honored guest."`
`".........I, I also acknowledge it.`
` ...Can't argue back."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I acknowledge it.`
` .........I have absolutely no complaints.`
` I can't believe it's really......`
` .........I have to honestly respect you."`
`"Me too...`
` ............Incredible.`
` I genuinely respect you.`
` ......So I have to acknowledge it."`
`"I acknowledge it too...`
` .........I still can't believe it.`
` ...Still, .........what can I do? `
`You've proven devils!`
` It's your victory...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` The Devil's Proof was a convenient excuse that you liked using to show that something was impossible to prove, ......but now it's become your mortal enemy, has it not?"`
`"......Don't torture me, great witch.`
` .........I've already acknowledged you.`
` I resign."`
`"........................"`
`".........Kyrie.`
` Do you still have any objections...? `
`I must have everyone in agreement.`
` If you alone will not acknowledge my existence..."`
`As the witch laughed boldly, the siblings started getting frantic.`
`...They were afraid of displeasing the witch.`
` Kyrie lightly closed her eyes, ...and after keeping silent for a while, opened her mouth.`
`"...My apologies.`
` ......I resign."`
`Only Kyrie had faced the witch with stern eyes until the end.`
`......However, she had only been able to resist acknowledging the truth for a short time.`
` The truth...the being...that was before her eyes...couldn't be denied.`
` Devils had already been proven...!`
`".........I also...acknowledge it.`
` ......You are Beatrice.`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` ...And a user of great magic.`
` ...............I must acknowledge the fact that you are a witch...!"`
