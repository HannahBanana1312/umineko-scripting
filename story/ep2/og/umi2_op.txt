`"Hey George-sama, please look!`
` They're so cute, look, look!"`
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks playfully swimming in the tank,`
` running around like a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time.`
`"Yeah, they're really cute.`
` I almost want to eat them."`
`"I, I'd feel so sorry for them... `
`Did you know?`
` I hear that the only people in the world who come to an aquarium and say that the fish look delicious are the Japanese."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these."`
`"...Uh,`
` ...um......`
` err..."`
`"Those clothes look good on you.`
` Really."`
`Shannon embraced her chest with both hands in embarrassment.`
`...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes that she wasn't used to.`
` Even though George's face didn't show it, the truth was that he'd said something so completely unexpected that it surprised even him,`
` and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside.`
` However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was, `
`he started to feel as though he was teasing the girl he liked, `
`and instead of embarrassment, a ticklish amusement welled up in him.`
`......No, he didn't just feel like he was doing it.`
`...He really was teasing the girl he liked.`
` Nevertheless,`
` ......he had thought that such embarrassing expressions wouldn't even show up in manga these days.`
` On the contrary, if he had seen another couple acting like that, he'd feel like throwing rocks at them.`
` However, even if rocks were thrown at us now, `
`I'm sure they would be just like confetti celebrating us.`
` Now, I can't even remember those lonely days...`
` when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings.`
` To use an old-fashioned phrase, these would be rose-colored days....`
` I'm so entranced that I don't even notice the big tank of the world's largest aquarium.`
` Instead, I see Shannon rejoicing and playing with the fish.`
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......?`
` It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in."`
`"I heard that this tank is the biggest selling point here.`
` And that it's the biggest in the whole world."`
`"Is that so?`
` That's amazing.`
` ......It's really wonderful.`
` It doesn't even look like a tank at all, but rather like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here."`
`"I agree.`
` This is a splendid little sea."`
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank.`
` That's why I thought her expression about cutting of a part of the sea with a knife was so interesting.`
` No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, they stick to their own view of the world in the end.`
` Maybe that's why it's so interesting to mingle with people who have a different worldview.`
` I was honest when I said that.`
` Then, she responded.`
`"Certainly, this might not be the real sea.`
` ...But, if those little guys swimming in there believe that it's the sea, then to them it certainly is the sea."`
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank?"`
`"The sea is finite too.`
` But, even if the sea were infinite,`
` how much could we cover in our whole lives?`
` I'm sure that it would only be a miniscule fraction of the sea."`
`"...Certainly.`
` It's ironic, isn't it?`
` Even though the world is so vast, most of us live our lives without ever leaving our own country."`
`"If they believe that this place is a complete world, `
`then it would be a wonderful world, a sea...even if it were in the bottom of a narrow well.`
` ...A sea in the eyes of the frogs that live there."`
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island 10 kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima, `
`said that with a smile.`
` After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a small late-afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view.`
` This buffet would certainly cause any boy's heart to jump about.`
` I myself was like that in the past.`
` But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different.`
` I couldn't shamefully pile on only the things I like.`
` I was...how should I put it...worried about my appearance and choose a menu suited for a snob, `
`toast, salad and coffee.`
` If I were by myself, I'd have made a pile of oily stuff like yakisoba, mash potato, gratins, and the like.`
`"Shannon, is that enough for you?`
` If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency."`
`"...Umm,`
` I, I didn't mean to imply that......"`
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad.`
` Maybe the reason I thought she should have at least one more dish was because I was thinking with man's stomach.`
`"George-sama, will that be enough for you?`
` I think it's better for men to eat a little bit more.`
` ...I imagine that you would normally eat more than that during lunch, right?"`
`"Oops, really?`
` You must have figured out how much I eat when I had lunch on the island."`
`"Yes.`
` So, is your stomach not feeling good today?"`
`Shannon suspected that I wasn't feeling well.`
` It seems that I've made her worry with my stupid attempt to show off.`
` Besides, it didn't seem that my stomach would let me show off any longer.`
`"...Gah, ahaha....`
` I'll confess already.`
` I was just trying to look cool...`
` I just held back because I was with a girl...."`
`"I thought so.`
` Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought that this wasn't nearly enough.`
` Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go and choose another dish."`
`"It's not fair for only me to be embarrassed.`
` What about you, Shannon?`
` How do you manage your work for the Ushiromiya family while eating so little?"`
`"......Umm, uh,`
` ............au."`
`Shannon grew silent and blushed bright red.`
` Apparently, I wasn't the only one showing off.`
` When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely.`
`"My, my, that isn't enough for you, is it?`
` Yes, normally, you eat more than this for lunch."`
`"A, a woman's stomach made of magic, so this is enough...`
` au."`
`"Then it must mean that we were both showing off to each other.`
` Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?"`
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and stood up from the seat.`
`"After finally coming to Okinawa, it would be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon.`
` I think I'll even have some fried bitter melon.`
` Shannon, come with me.`
` C'mon, c'mon."`
`"Aah, yes...!"`
`To anyone watching us, we might seem like a pretty humorous and embarrassing couple.`
` But it's only after trying to become a couple that you realize.`
` This whole arguing back and forth means the world to us.`
` That's why no matter how much everyone else stared at us with blank eyes, we wouldn't have noticed it.`
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard to their surroundings.`
` After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a lovely cake.`
` While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch.`
`"Even though it's a restaurant with a view of the sea, it's so cloudy."`
`Luckily, from our window seats we were shown seaside scenery so grandiose that it didn't fit entirely within our field of vision.`
` However, because of the cloudy sky, it was a far cry from its normal beauty.`
`"That's right.`
` If it were clear, we would undoubtedly see a deep blue sea."`
`"Yep.`
` Even though I imagine you're used to the sea at Rokkenjima, normally, the sea here surely should have been an exceptional blue color.`
` ...It's a real shame."`
`"Aah, but..., no matter how blue it is, the sea I see during work might as well be gray.`
` But, today, I'm not working so, ...I mean..."`
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line.`
` But I didn't let her get off easy.`
`"What a shame.`
` If only you'd said 'When watching the sea with you, it would look deep blue no matter how gray it was', `
`I'd have given you full marks and a prize."`
`"Uh,`
` ah,`
` I, I, I'm sorry.......`
` nnnnnn...."`
`"Wanna hear what my reward was?"`
`"Umm, `
`......, `
`uh, `
`if you wouldn't mind......."`
`"No.`
` I won't tell you.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Th, that's no fair...."`
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid that got bullied.`
` When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies.`
` Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me.`
` But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why.`
` This is so much fun.`
` I can play with her emotions however I please, `
`...and I can have them all to myself.`
` Right now, I can't think of any higher pleasure.`
` That's why I have to treat her lightly.`
` I don't want her to get embarrassed and think bad of me.`
` That's why I decided to end this topic here and now.`
` I didn't want to be too obstinate.`
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach?`
` Maybe the clouds will clear up and we'll be able to see a picturesque sea."`
`"That's right.`
` I want to go see it."`
`"Yeah, let's do it.`
` ...But, that looks like a really delicious cake.`
` I wonder if I should get one like that too."`
`"You can't...`
` If you eat cake after already eating so much, you will get fat. `
`It looks like Hideyoshi-sama's blood is pretty thick on you, George-sama, so if you don't take care, you will get chubby."`
`"Shannon, you won't stop liking me if I get fat, will you...?`
` After all, I wouldn't stop liking you if you did."`
`"I, I didn't mean it that way...`
` If you don't take good care of your body, your health will...,`
` au."`
`"Mother warns me all the time too.`
` Still, I also wonder if I should start doing some exercises or take up Tai-chi-chuan."`
`"You should start reconsidering your eating habits and go on a diet, instead of just exercising more.`
` And furthermore, I heard that if you don't keep on exercising as well, you won't get any results."`
`"In other words, you're telling me to not eat cake, right?`
` Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with that cake, Shannon."`
`"Uh,`
` umm,`
` .........`
`......Maybe one whole cake is too much but,`
` ......maybe just half of one would be alright.`
` Here, it's really delicious."`
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my dessert plate.`
` I had no doubt that she wanted to share the delicious cake's flavor with me.`
` Even so, I boldly and meanly pushed that plate away.`
` She blinked her eyes in surprise.`
` She could't seem to figure out if that was a refusal of the cake or not.`
` So I winked, opened my mouth, and said 'aah'.`
`"*giggle*.`
` This is what you've wanted from the beginning, isn't it?`
` ......Sheesh, you're such a pampered child, George-sama. `
`Ok,`
` say 'aah'."`
`While still wearing an embarrassed, annoyed face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork.`
`*chomp*.`
` It had the flavor of cheap chocolate you could find anywhere.`
` Still, it was exceptional.`
` Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were a couple of perfect fools, had been my dream for many years.`
` It made this cake's flavor heavenly....`
` If the Earth is destined to end someday, I wouldn't have any regrets if it happened right now.`
`......It was such a moment of bliss.`
` After that, we gathered shells, ran from waves and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach.`
` In the end, the clouds never parted.`
` However, we both believed that our eyes were still reflecting a deep, blue sea.`
`"......Somehow, I'm so happy,`
` ...I'm getting scared."`
`"You do say that from time to time.`
` What is it that you're afraid of?"`
`"...I'm`
`, .........a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` For someone like me, ...to be hanging out with a member of the Ushiromiya family... `
`Umm,`
` .........It just seems like too much for me."`
`"I'm also surprised.`
` I didn't just meet you yesterday or today, Shannon-chan.`
` We've known each other for years now.`
` But, we can only meet during the annual family conference. `
`...I never imagined getting into a relationship where I could spend time with you like this.`
` It's the same for you too, right?"`
`"Eerh,`
` ......I'm, `
`......umm..."`
`"Hm?"`
`"......I only, `
`......imagined.`
` No, umm, err!`
` Rather than imagination,`
` ......it was more like a delusion......`
` When I started this relationship with you, George-sama, when you're always so considerate and gentlemanly,`
` ...I mean, it just felt like a delusion......."`
`"Then, our relationship happened thanks to your believing heart.`
` Magic dwells in the power of feeling.`
` So, I'm sure that magic has brought us together."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I really think, ......that this is truly magic."`
`"But, you know, that's not quite right.`
` Every time we met, the Shannon within my heart kept becoming more and more beautiful.`
` If the same thing happened to you, `
`then the fact that we are here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle."`
`"...............No.`
` A miracle did happen, `
`George-sama."`
`She stopped walking on the beach, gazing beyond the sea.`
`" ......A miracle?"`
`"No, magic.`
` ...It happened."`
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious expression, which I sometimes heard her use.`
`"......Magic, you say?"`
`"Yes, magic.`
` .........Even if I say it, you probably won't believe me, so I won't say it.`
` But, that magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle which caused you and I to meet each other."`
`"You mean, like a good-luck charm?"`
`"Yes.`
` Maybe it was something like that.`
` ...Except that it wasn't a charm, ...it really was magic."`
`"...Hmm?"`
`Shannon wasn't the only one who'd want to credit an encounter on a miracle or serendipity, it might be a universal thing all girls share.`
` For a man like me, 70% of an encounter with a girl is an endeavour to try and please her, while 20% of it is raw courage.`
` And the remaining 10% is luck.`
` What she chooses to believe weighs little in my thoughts.`
`...Maybe that way of thinking is in itself calculating and typical of men.`
` But, were I to express that in words, any kind of magic would be broken.`
` I thought that, before we entered into this relationship, we both had many fortuities, concessions and great efforts.`
` After all that, if she wants to call these times together 'magic',`
` that isn't strange in the slightest.`
` That's why I answered her the way I did.`
`"You're right.`
` ......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, maybe you and I could get into a relationship like this only one of those times.`
` In the other instances, even though we would be aware of each other, maybe we would have only maintained a reserved relationship after all this time.`
` Compared to those otherworldly selves, we are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship."`
`"It's not like that...`
`......it really is magic. `
`...No matter how often you tell men something like this, they'll never believe it.`
` Kanon-kun didn't believe me at all, either."`
`"...I believe you.`
` ......Because I wouldn't want to break the magic by not believing in it."`
`"George-sama..."`
`In a small voice, I apologized for making light of her magic.`
` Those words seemed to make Shannon a lot happier.`
` After all, if a pair of people believes in the magic of love, it becomes eternal.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` I have one more whim., but I'm not sure if you'd be willing to listen."`
`"...Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"You know how you call me 'George-sama'?`
` It's not that I dislike it, but would you not call me that anymore?"`
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I wouldn't force you to do so during your everyday routine at Rokkenjima.`
` But, when we are alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that.`
` Yeah, let's create that rule."`
`"A, a rule?`
` I, if I violate that rule, what would happen...?"`
`"Hmm...`
` Maybe we should have some kind of punishment game if you transgress the rule.`
` ...Yes, what should it be...`
`......Wanna hear?"`
`"N, no, I don't want to hear..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` I'll have to think about what it should be."`
`"Ok.`
` ......George...`
` san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` It sounds cool, doesn't it?`
` I'm so happy,`
` Shannon."`
`"I,`
` ......I also,`
` ......have another name`
`.........Sayo."`
`"I got it.`
` The rule must be fair.`
` I'll also keep it, and from now on, I'll have to call you Sayo.`
` Alright?`
` Sayo...?"`
`"Y-yes."`
`I embraced her shoulder.`
` Then I forcefully embraced her entire body while she dived into my chest like a doll.`
` As I held her head in my arms, we looked at the horizon.`
`"What a deep blue sea.`
` I'm so happy that we can look at this sea, just the two of us."`
`"......Me too.`
` I'm very happy that I can look at this deep blue sea with you."`
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down, `
`we kept listening to each other's heartbeats.`
` The sound of waves soaked into my ears.`
`...No, this was the sound of enraged waves.`
` My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, did not allow me to forget.`
` It wouldn't let me forget the memories of the day when my old fate was broken and smashed.`
` In the past, tomorrows were literally like a mirror to me.`
` The person I am now, was always projected there.`
`......It was a tomorrow absolutely no different from today.`
` That was my old fate.`
`...But at that moment, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror.`
` The witch whispers.`
` She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
` She torments me, saying that as long as I stay in the paradise of god, I'll remain furniture.`
` So I try to choose to know love, and become a person.`
`......Those days were like sweetly melting honey, `
`......but then, I hadn't realized that they were the beginning of the days filled with a new kind of suffering.......`
` I came to this small island on a motorboat that I had just learned how to use.`
` No, I couldn't possibly call it a small island.`
` It'd really be more appropriate to call it a reef.`
` On the reef, there was a torii and a small shrine for the local deity.`
` It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima.`
`......Even though I didn't know the exact meaning, I understood that it had a holy significance.`
` Even in a place like this, I took just one more look around to see if there was someone who'd find fault with me being here.`
`......The only things I could see were the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside.`
` I readied myself,`
` ......timidly approached the small shrine,`
` ...and took the mirror that was offered to that place.`
` It was an old-looking mirror, dim and dirty.`
`......If it were an ordinary mirror, that'd probably give you a terribly bad impression of its value.`
`...However, since the mirror had been offered to this small shrine, it made you feel some kind of divinity.`
`......And I noticed.`
` This was not merely a mirror.`
`...Even if it would have been nothing more than an old-looking mirror to a non-believer like myself, it was actually a mirror that had an important meaning.`
`......Is it really alright to break it after being captivated by honeyed words?`
`......No, this is not really a mirror.`
`...This is my life that I could not escape until today, and my fate.`
` I'll break it.`
` I'll break it, ......and seize a life from beyond the mirror.`
` If I don't break it, my life will forever be a pair of facing mirrors.`
` Nothing will ever change in the slightest....`
` The witch whispers.`
` She tempts me to take a bite of true wisdom.`
` Maybe I'm already having a taste of that truth.`
` Because I ended up knowing those maddening sentiments.`
` Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck the fig leaf.`
` By now, ...`
`...I must break this mirror.`
` Until today, I had fought for many days.`
` Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me and the part that sided with the witch repeatedly fought each other.`
` And now, here I am.`
` Did the part of me who is here win or lose? `
`There's only one thing I know.`
` To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something.`
` The cowards who don't risk loss and never try to change anything will never receive the key that opens the path to a new future.`
` The key is already in my hands.`
` The key is to break this.`
` To break it.`
` Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned in Rokkenjima? `
`No. `
`There's nothing but this.`
` Come, have courage.`
` I'll free myself from being mere furniture.`
` And I'll receive new sufferings, and become human.`
` These are surely the small and large trials I must impose on myself.`
` Come on,`
` ......break it.`
` Break the eternally unchangeable fate that imprisons me, into pieces......! `
`I raise the mirror high...`
`......and think back on the preceding days of conflict,`
`......and, finishing my reflections in the blink of an eye,...`
`...`
` I throw it.`
` The thunder roars, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act.`
`...Certainly, that was the hatred of the angels who were trying to banish me from eternal paradise.`
` I look down on the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts..., `
`and after I made sure I've accomplished my task,`
` ......I scream while looking up at the enraged sky.`
`"...I,`
` ...............I kept, `
`......the promise....`
`......Now,`
` .........it's your turn to keep your promise with me, right......?"`
`A thunder roars once more.`
`...I'm already banished from paradise.`
` That's why I have to struggle by myself in order to live.`
` The witch said it.`
` That's the sole element of the world.`
` To lose it means to lose the world.`
`...Like how a canteen with a hole on the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you pump into it....`
`"......I kept the promise.`
` .........Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.`
` ......Please, grant my wish!`
` Beatrice-samaaaaaa!!"`
