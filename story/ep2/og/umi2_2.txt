`"Eeeeeeeeeh?! `
`What do you mean, separate rooms?! `
`Then, Shannon, you and George nii-san stayed at different rooms on purpose?!"`
`"Y-,...... Yes... `
`I mean, ...... was it that strange......?"`
`Since Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with chocolate-coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a present from Okinawa, `
`it all flew out at Shannon when Jessica cried out...`
`"...Sh, Shannon, why did you even go on a trip up to Okinawa...? `
`And even alone with George nii-san!"`
`"That is, I mean..., since there's a very big aquarium in Okinawa, I was invited to go and... `
`I, ...like fish and stuff..."`
`"No, that's not it!!ã€€`
`This is a young couple going on an overnight trip, right?! `
`And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?! `
`To say nothing of the fact that the guy and girl were staying in different rooms!!"`
`"As for k, kisses, no comment. `
`Ah, but we did hug... `
`George-san's chest was warm..."`
`"That's not the point!! `
`Aah, geez! `
`Why do couples like this exist?! `
`Aaah, geez!! `
`It's so irritating!"`
`A lot of things had happened to Shannon and it seemed to have been a very happy trip, `
`but it looked like Jessica found it pretty irritating.`
` For a while, Jessica chewed on her present, `
`complaining about romance and pretending to faint in agony on her bed.`
` Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there.`
` And they had used the aquarium as an excuse to get together.`
` Since their relationship had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value.`
`"What a turning point! `
`It was your first overnight trip!! `
`Shouldn't there have been lots of progress?! `
`And even so, `
`separate rooms for the guy and girl?! `
`A couple taking two single rooms?! `
`Aah, geez, really, what's wrong with you!"`
`"...Err, umm, ......but we're both single... `
`...George-san says showing restraint is good manners for a couple......."`
`"Like I said, this overnight trip was so you could overcome that stage, right?! `
`You're already at the level of things like kissing and hugging, right?!"`
`"M, Milady, I don't know what you mean by that.... `
`G, George-sama was a real gentleman with me until the end. `
`That is, I mean, `
`...... I also, `
`...wondered if those things would happen, you know, `
`...but we, even though we are going out, `
`I mean, it, it's not that we are married or anything..."`
`"What Milady seems to be expecting, `
`......I mean, we must do so only after we properly make a vow in front of God, umm, `
`......w w, we must..., `
`au."`
`Shannon's face got bright red.`
` She made a circle with both hands, restlessly intertwining, separating and making heart marks with them.`
` Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened, `
` but it seemed that it had been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way.`
`...So in the end, whether Jessica was jealous of Shannon or cheered for her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her.`
`"Aah, I want a boyfriend toooo!! `
`I can't believe Shannon got ahead of me!! `
`Even though we promised that we would find boyfriends at the same time, you beat me, `
`Aarrrrrrgh!"`
`"U, umm... `
`Milady is a wonderful person, so I'm sure a wonderful person will appear very soon...."`
`"Don't try to console me!! `
`Shannon, you traitor, get o-ut, shut u-p! `
`*cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica threw several cushions at her.`
` But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to choke pretty badly.`
` Shannon hurriedly ran over to a nearby side table and started searching around on top of it.`
` A lovely basket was placed there and inside of it was Jessica's bronchodilator.`
` Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica.`
` Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly.`
` Because of this, she always carried this medicine around.`
` She breathed in the medicine and, after a while, managed to overcome her choking as her asthma finally settled down.`
` Shannon thought this a good chance to leave and tried to exit the room after bowing courteously...`
` As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head.`
` She noticed that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion. `
`That face was red and meek...`
`"...... M, Milady......?"`
`"Sha, ......Shannon...`
`...Be honest with me...`
`.........Is my, `
`............hairdo and stuff, ...... strange....?"`
`"What are you saying... `
`I think that your hair is very beautiful."`
`"Then, ...then, then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose? `
`...Or is it the way I talk after all......? `
`Is that why I can't get a boyfriend......?"`
`"Of course not. `
`Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are. `
`And I think that your charm will keep on increasing more and more from now on."`
`" ......But, it's only me who can't find a boyfriend... `
`Saku and Hina managed to find a boyfriend, but only I can't...... `
`Is it because I don't have any charm after all......? `
`You know, everyone will bring their boyfriend along to the cultural festival...... `
`I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend before that day, and I said so, boldly...`
`.........I can't find a boyfriend. `
`Only me, only me......."`
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears.`
` Jessica didn't really feel like crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend.`
`...However, as she had cheered Shannon on, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and she couldn't help but shed tears...`
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart.`
` Jessica's ordinary rough style of speech,`
` was all just an attempt to protect her own easily injured heart.`
`......As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon.`
` Shannon understood that.`
` So, ...she strongly regretted getting into even a slightly good mood.`
`"...S, .........sorry...`
` Crying like this, I'm, weird.`
` Sorry, ......*sniffle*."`
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady.`
` There is no way that a wonderful man won't appear for you, Milady..."`
`".........Sh, Shannon, it's about time, right?`
` If you don't go quickly, Genji-san and Mom will get mad.`
` I'm perfectly fine, so go quickly...!`
` Heheh, sorry for crying like this.`
` ......I'm such a moron."`
`Jessica faced away, acting as though she didn't really want to trouble Shannon,`
` waving her hand as though driving Shannon away.`
` Shannon took that as a sign that anything more would be obnoxious, `
`bowed her head, and left the room...`
` When her footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging a cushion.`
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes,`
` ...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart.`
`"I also, `
`............want to fall, `
`in love..."`
`As Shannon watered the flower beds in the garden in high spirits, she sensed someone's presence.`
` She turned around, thinking that if this was one of the family coming to see her, she must greet them,`
` ......and what she saw was that witch.`
`"B, ......Beatrice-sama........."`
`"It's been quite some time.`
` How are you?`
` Has your relationship with your special person progressed since last time?"`
`As Beatrice sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe.`
` Sitting in a place like that would get you pricked by the roses, `
`and it might have been dangerous if you fell off the arch, ...but after all, this was a witch.`
` That would surely be worrying too much.`
`"...Y, yes.`
` Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly."`
`"Naturally, my magic is instantaneous.`
` Maybe you feel that your meeting was a predetermined fate.`
` But that isn't correct, don't think this has anything to do with fate."`
`"......I, ......I understand that."`
`The witch was calling attention to something.`
` Two things, actually.`
` Originally, her relationship with George had been completely impossible.`
`......And the power of magic was so great that it could distort that.`
` Shannon had just gotten wrapped up in those sweet days, and had started believing the illusion that all fate revolved around her.`
`...But she remembered the witch's words.`
` Originally, her relationship with George had been impossible, `
`.........no, it might also be impossible in the future as well...`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry. `
`It's just like a doctor.`
` Even though you rely on them when you worry about your health, after you're healed, you forget even to thank them.`
` ......I've never been thanked as a witch, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely.`
` Forgive me."`
`".........I have never forgotten my feelings of gratitude.`
` ...I was able to achieve happiness thanks to your power, Beatrice-sama.`
` ......And without that power, the fate that brought me and George-sama together wouldn't have happened.`
` ...I have never forgotten that."`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` It's not like I came here to bully you.`
` Talking rudely is just my personality.`
` Do forgive me. `
`...More importantly, I heard, I heard!`
` About your trip alone with him.`
` I'm sure it was quite fun."`
`"Y, yes!`
` It was very, umm, ...fun."`
`Shannon's face suddenly grew bright.`
` The witch laughed lightly, as though that transformation was worth money.`
`"Already the person of your thoughts is no longer an object of one-sided love.`
` You are a pair of lovers now.`
` ......To a pair filled with love, that alone is all they need in the world.`
` Is this a wonderful, ideal world?`
` Heheheheheh!`
` Even witches would be jealous."`
`Beatrice laughed pleasantly.`
` That smile made her look as though she blessed the lovers' rendezvous from the bottom of her heart, without a trace of malice.`
` After that day, Beatrice had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while.`
` Even now, Shannon still thought of her as a creepy being.`
`...However, she was also indebted to this person for bestowing the magic that had given her the relationship she had with George.`
` So Shannon tried with all her might not to be surprised or scared.`
`"Th..., that's right. `
`......Umm, Beatrice-sama.`
` I bought some sweets as a souvenir from our trip.`
` ...Would you, umm, ......like some?"`
`"Hoh???`
` A souvenir for a witch.........?"`
`It seemed that even a witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't been able to predict that she would receive a souvenir from a pair of sweet lovers.`
` When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of the witch as a friend for the first time.`
`"Hohoh, an Oriental cookie made from wheat flour and lard.`
` To wrap that in western chocolate is truly a blending of Japanese and western style, the silk road of sweets."`
`".........What?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"N, ...nothing.`
` My apologies."`
`This witch, who surely held a terrifying power, `
`was chomping down on sweets one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth.`
` After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter.`
`"Hmmm, a good meal.`
` ......I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days.`
` Roses are the symbol of eternal love.`
` I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now."`
`The witch was in a great mood, fully enjoying modern candy.`
`"Umm, .........here.`
` I truly wish to thank you so much.`
` I believe you have done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this."`
`The thing that Shannon had softly set on the table...was a gold-colored butterfly brooch.`
`"There is no need to return it.`
` If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity."`
`"......Maybe I was given a chance to meet him by the power of magic.`
` But I think the effort that will make that meeting eternal will come from the two of us cooperating together."`
`"Hmmm.`
` ......Love and roses are the same.`
` Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot.`
` Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work.`
` In that case, do as you wish.`
` You may wear it or keep it in a box.`
` That is my good will, given to you.`
` It would not please me if you were to return it to me."`
`"Ah, ......m, my apologies...!`
` That's not what I..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` No harm has been done.`
` That brooch is already yours.`
` If you treasure that proof of our friendship, that would comfort me a bit."`
`"You may hold on to it, and gain its benefits.`
` You may also keep it in a box.`
` If you wish, it is up to you whether you give it to another who is worrying about love.`
` ......But you should regard it as important.`
` Of course, it would pain my heart if you wasted it."`
`According to Beatrice, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons so that she could give them a tool imbued with some kind of magical power.`
`...However, when most people used that power to resolve their worries,`
` they quickly came to think of that power as creepy, and, forgetting their feelings of thanks, they threw the tools they had been given away with disgust.`
`"So I haven't often received thanks for my good will.`
` ......Let's see, is this the first time?`
` *cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh in Shannon's eyes.`
` She herself had been like that in the past, ...no, maybe she was still like that now.`
` Beatrice was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power.`
` Most likely, no one would go along with her if they could help it.`
` Surely, even though they had relied on that strange power, people sometimes felt fear rather than gratitude as a result.`
`......It must have deeply hurt the witch when that repeated over and over.`
` Since the time she had started thinking that way,`
` ...Shannon had tried to stop being frightened of Beatrice.`
` That was surely what had tormented her for longer than one thousand years...`
` Maybe she really liked the sweets.`
` Beatrice, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her, and looked to be in remarkably high spirits.`
` After doing that for a while, the witch and the servant grew animated talking about the trip with George.`
` Shannon didn't know much about Beatrice.`
` First off, she was a ghost-like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times.`
` And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there.`
` It seemed that each person had something called a wavelength, and that the ability to perceive it varied greatly among different people.`
` Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this.`
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much.`
` From what Beatrice said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent.`
` And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her.`
` Previously, when Shannon had messed up and Natsuhi had gotten really mad at her, Beatrice had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe.`
`...I see, Natsuhi really hadn't noticed at all.`
` But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more.`
`"Then, ......what about the Master?`
` I hear that he has been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he would be able to notice you, Beatrice-sama."`
`"............Kinzo is the same.`
` There is no one with a more pitiful lack of magical talent.`
` ...It's the blood.`
` He has so little talent that I feel sorry for him."`
`"..................?"`
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around Beatrice changed.`
` She had spoken about Krauss and the rests' lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way.`
` Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold.`
`...According to that, Kinzo had summoned the witch Beatrice, and had been given the gold.`
`...In other words, that meant that she had some kind of relationship with Kinzo.`
`"That was because, ......even though he didn't have a scrap of talent, he succeeded.`
` ...He kept studying by himself like mad, and reached the level of magician."`
`"That's, .........something really incredible, right......?"`
`"......Hmm."`
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was unexpectedly praising someone.`
`...While she lambasted him, saying that he had no talent, she praised Kinzo's efforts.`
`"And then, .........the Master summoned Beatrice-sama with the power of magic......"`
`"Hmm.`
` ......Well, I only answered the summons on a whim.`
` In this period where magic has long been denied, those without a scrap of talent give it their all.`
` It was just my luck that I'd decide to come and laugh at him.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The words 'just her luck', ...showed that this had been a disaster for her.`
` Shannon hesitated over whether it would be alright to continue this discussion, but Beatrice continued on her own, ignoring Shannon.`
`"A format and rules had been assembled.`
` Several customs were mixed in, but, well, in deference to his enthusiasm, we created a lenient contract.`
` ......Then I gave him a mountain of gold."`
`"Then the Master..., used that gold and succeeded in business, and grew his wealth into what it is today."`
`"Hmm. His talent in magic was nothing, but it seems he had talent in business and gambling.`
` ...Or was it because of his bravery and madness to bet everything on unreasonable bets.`
` ......Madness sometimes brings about magic.`
` I see, if you look at it that way, maybe I can't really say that Kinzo had absolutely no magical talent.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming.`
` While everyone in the Ushiomiya family knew of the story regarding how Kinzo had idolized black magic, summoned a witch, and been given gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in.`
` And now that she was hearing that it was true from the witch herself...`
` Shannon felt a little flustered at this insane secret that only she knew.`
`"Then Kinzo, who had obtained a vast fortune, could completely obtain every dream one can satisfy with objects they can obtain in the human world.`
` .........And in the end, he searched for the truth of the world."`
`"The truth, ...of the world?"`
`"...The single element that makes up the world.`
` Kinzo, who had achieved everything one can obtain in the human world, wanted that, the final desire humans seek."`
`The single element.`
` .........She felt like she had heard the witch say that word before.`
` When Beatrice saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she laughed bitterly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to remember.`
`"......I underestimated Kinzo a little.`
` I truly hadn't thought that he would display such power."`
`"......And thanks to that, I'm in this state.`
` I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with.`
` ...No matter who I try to talk to, my voice doesn't reach them, and no matter where I go, I cannot do anything.`
` Such boring decades."`
`As she laughed in self-derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger.`
` It made the transparent sound of pottery.`
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word 'self-derision' was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face.`
` Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation.`
`...And it was probably a topic that she could not press the witch on easily, unless the witch started talking about it herself.`
` To sum up everything she had said up until now...`
` Beatrice, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason.`
` And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom.`
` During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to strongly respect the witch.`
` And she had helped the witch to regain her power, if only a little bit.`
`...As a result, she had become able to drink tea with Shannon like this...`
`"......Beatrice-sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?"`
`"Aaah, that story. `
`.........Long ago, it seems various things happened on the islands around this area.`
` Because of that, bad things gathered, drawn towards an evil distortion.`
` It seems that a traveling eastern magician or something built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there."`
`"...That in itself had nothing to do with me, but unfortunately the foundation of that magical power was different.`
` It created a strong interference with my magical power, and was extremely bothersome."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` And I just assumed that it sealed you, Beatrice-sama..."`
`"I was not its target.`
` But it was a divine mirror.`
` As a result, my power was sealed away. `
`......If you were to use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this.`
` Let's say that the western-style food I ordered is being made in the kitchen.`
` However, when they try to set the table, the area for the guest seating is in the Japanese style with Japanese style dishes.`
` So the kitchen is unable to take out a plate which would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my western-style food won't arrive..., something like that."`
`"So you destroyed that Japanese-style guest seating, and returned the area to a blank slate for a time.`
` Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say.`
` However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived.`
` It will still be quite some time before the main dish.`
` As I am now, I'm even more faint than a fairy in a shoe store."`
`".........Pu, `
`......ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Mu.`
` What is so funny?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I thought the witch's example was so interesting.`
` I never thought you could use a story about food as an analogy for a story about magic."`
`"I had planned that to be a skillful expression, if I do say so myself, but I was sure it wouldn't be laughed at.`
` It's a little unexpected."`
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face.`
`...It wasn't a strange expression at all to be appearing on the face of some friends as they enjoyed their tea.`
`"......Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past.`
` ...I've gotten soft.`
` Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human."`
`She was probably talking to herself.`
` As Beatrice gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again.`
`"...The clouds have come out.`
` When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle."`
`"You think so?`
` ......I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even if it gets cloudy."`
`"............Hmph."`
`Maybe the witch noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words.`
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup.`
`"......It seems that those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore.`
` How is it?`
` ......Do you understand the feeling of furniture being reborn as a human?"`
`"............Yes. `
`...I did not know that the world was this kind."`
`Since her relationship with George had begun, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often.`
` Her smile had made everything go smoothly, and had even changed her luck.`
`......Shannon made less mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was starting to change slightly.`
` Just the other day, Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her, surprising her.`
`"You've been making a good smile more often lately, haven't you?`
` Has something good happened?"`
`"N, no...`
` But, ......every day is fun, yes."`
`"Hmph.`
` Isn't that a good thing?`
` Coffee is obviously more delicious if it's poured with a smile.`
` ......Could I ask for that smile again?"`
`"Y, ......yes!"`
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself.`
` Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that anyone would notice.`
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit.`
` Shannon understood it clearly.`
` Knowing love was the same as gaining a soul.`
` ...And therefore she was born again from furniture to a human.`
` There was absolutely nothing wrong with Beatrice's words.`
` ......By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human.`
`"......These have been unusual snacks.`
` It was time well spent.`
` It's probably about time for you to return to your work.`
` Let us end our tea party now. `
`......After all, someone doesn't like it when you drink tea with me, right?"`
`"Huh?"`
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air.`
`...After that, was launched by the fingers of some invisible person in empty space, and flew straight at a bush close nearby.`
` The bush moved violently, and Kanon came out.`
`......It seemed that he had been there for some time, and had been watching their tea party.`
` The spoon was gripped in his hand.`
`...If he hadn't caught it in an instant, it might have hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood.`
`".................."`
`"Do not worry.`
` Our tea party is over now, Kanon."`
`"How long were you there?`
` If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..."`
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............"`
`Kanon kept silent, but it seemed that there was a slightly hostile look in his eyes.`
`...On the outside, he acted respectfully.`
` But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch. `
`When Beatrice hit the table with her pipe, the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards as one.`
` They then scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done.`
`"It was fun, Shannon.`
` ...Let us meet again if the chance arises.`
` ......My magical power is still quite lacking.`
` It's tiring even to show myself."`
`"......If you're that tired, never appear again."`
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but it seemed the witch had heard it perfectly.`
` She giggled, but did not reply.`
`"Shannon.`
` Tell me more about George at our next tea party.`
` There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` See you again."`
`Beatrice's body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared.`
`...It was a very fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf.`
` For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit...`
` Kanon approached her from behind, and spoke with a very different expression on his face than his sister's.`
`".........Nee-san, didn't I tell you that you shouldn't hang around with her?"`
`"Beatrice-sama isn't that bad of a person.`
` ...Yes, she might be a little strange, but-"`
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough...`
` That person isn't human.`
` There's no way we could understand what she's planning."`
`"Kanon-kun, I think that's a little rude."`
`Shannon spoke seriously, which was unusual for her.`
`...To Kanon, who knew her well, it must have seemed extremely serious.`
` Kanon was excessively surprised at Shannon's style of speech, and remained silent.`
`"It's true that Beatrice-sama is different from humans.`
` She has a terrifying power, so I think she is to be feared and respected.`
` ...But just because she's different from a human, doesn't mean that it isn't really rude to loathe her like that."`
`"............I understand what you're trying to say, Nee-san.`
` ...You've changed since she gave you that brooch. `
`It's like you're the witch's prisoner.`
` She mediated your relationship with George-sama, and now you're indebted to her."`
`"...Don't say stuff like that."`
`"That person isn't human.`
` We don't know what she's thinking.`
` You mustn't trust her. `
`.........And we aren't humans either,`
` Nee-san."`
`Kanon's words became more serious.`
`...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart.`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and hung her head.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change how we were born."`
`You are no longer furniture...`
` Those words Beatrice had given her, which had made her happiest, floated through Shannon's mind...`
`"I am not, `
`.........furniture."`
`"No, you are furniture.`
` We are less than human.`
` ......Nee-san, you're acting like you've forgotten that, ...and you're just pretending to be human.`
` You should understand that yourself."`
`"I, ......am not furniture.`
` ...I'm human...!"`
`"No, you aren't human.`
` From the beginning, we have been unqualified to love or be loved."`
`It seemed that Kanon's criticism had shifted in focus ever since Shannon had suddenly started meeting with the witch.`
`...Shannon also noticed that quickly.`
`"I heard from Milady.`
` Seriously, what were you thinking?`
` I can't believe that you would go on a trip with George-sama...!`
` You've forgotten your place as furniture.`
` You've just been tempted by that witch, and mistakenly believe that you became human!"`
`"Listen, Kanon-kun.`
` ............We certainly are furniture.`
` Lesser beings, inferior to humans. `
`...But if we could replace that unfulfilled part...`
`...wouldn't that mean that we could become human?"`
`"......That couldn't happen."`
`"No, it could.`
` If we can gain that, we won't be furniture.`
` We can become human."`
`"............`
`.........Ridiculous.`
` ...As if you, ......could."`
`Kanon spat that out, ...but he said it weakly, and turned away.`
` He was probably giving up.`
`......After being baptized as furniture in his days of suffering, his heart was firmly sealed...`
`"...You can too, Kanon-kun.`
` ......You can become a normal human."`
`"..................`
` Stop it, that's the witch talking."`
`"Yes.`
` Beatrice-sama taught me.`
` ......By gaining the single element of the world, we can become human. `
`No, nobody's human if that isn't satisfied.`
` ......So people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element."`
`"I don't understand what you're saying, Nee-san.`
` I don't want to listen to ranting."`
`"Then I'll teach it so even you can understand.`
` .........Look, see what I'm pointing at?"`
`"......?"`
`Shannon quietly pointed at the sea, at the horizon.`
` Kanon didn't understand what she was actually pointing at, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which looked like it was posing a riddle.`
`"The sea.`
` ......Kanon-kun, what color does the sea look to you?"`
`It was a really simple question.`
` Kanon tried to guess the meaning behind that question for a while,`
` but since he couldn't think of anything, he obeyed and answered.`
`"...It's a vague, dark-gray color.`
` So what?"`
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words.`
`......But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly.`
`"It looks deep blue to me."`
`"......Is that what you mean?`
` Like calling a green traffic light blue?"`
`"No.`
` ......The sea is deep blue.`
` If I understand, and you do not,`
` ...that's what it means..."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while.`
`"..................`
`.........I, .........don't understand."`
`"Kanon-kun.`
` ......Would you stick out your hand?"`
`As Kanon was taken aback, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm, and opened the palm of his hand.`
` Shannon softly set something there.`
` It was that magic brooch, which she had received from Beatrice.`
` It was a magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, which could fulfill love.`
`"This is, `
`............hers......?"`
`"No, this is mine.`
` ...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?"`
`"............"`
`After being spoken to like that, he couldn't just throw it away.`
` Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand.`
` Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands.`
`"This charm holds true magical power.`
` ......I'm sure that it will teach you an important emotion, Kanon-kun."`
`"...Nothing can be taught from that person's magic."`
`"No, something can.`
` ......So wear it.`
` If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket."`
`"............Ridiculous...`
` As if I'd be led astray by that person's magic."`
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold-hearted towards something Shannon was pressing on him.`
` In the end, Kanon took it and agreed reluctantly, `
`as though saying he would prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power.`
` Shannon smiled and nodded back.`
`"I'm sure you can learn something important from it.`
` ......And I'm sure you can become human.`
` And when you do, I'm sure that this ocean will look like a beautiful blue to you as well, Kanon-kun."`
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times I look."`
`"That's wrong, Kanon-kun.`
` ......It only looks like that because you have no ****."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the main point of what she'd just said.`
` So Shannon said it once more.`
`...The single element of the world.`
` She spoke once more of the world where that was satisfied, where the sea was deep blue.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean.`
` After all-"`
`Without love, it cannot be seen.`
`".........Who is that there?"`
`"......It is Kanon, Master."`
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study.`
`......However, that in itself didn't mean his noble research had been suspended.`
` He may have left the study because of a change in mood, `
`but that didn't mean that the thoughts filling his head were any different from those he had had inside the study.`
` So Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always be a disturbance in his research.`
`"The weather is heavy.`
` Will it get worse?"`
`"Yes.`
` According to the weather report, it could rain at any time.`
` ......Shall I bring an umbrella?"`
`"It will not come to that.`
` ......You should leave me alone for a while.`
` If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am.`
` I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts."`
`"......Certainly.`
` Then, if you would excuse me."`
`During the time that Kanon bowed to him, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, and had forgotten that Kanon was there.`
` And once again, he began rambling to himself.`
` Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch was repeated many times.`
`"......Ooohh, Beatrice...`
` My hand will not reach your smile...`
` What should I do to revive you, what should I do so that you smile at me once again...?`
` ......What is lacking?`
` My research, my materials, my catalyst?`
` Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?!`
` Ooohhh, Beatrice, what can I do to see your face one more time...?`
` Ooooooooohhhhhhh......"`
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice with his back turned, he turned around just once.`
` When he did, `
`............right behind his isolated, old master, `
`......was the shadow of a person that shouldn't have been there.`
` It was, ......the witch.`
` At once, Kanon, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm, `
`quickly ran back to Kinzo, trying to become a shield himself.`
` But when he saw the expression on the witch's face, `
`...that emotion of his vanished.`
` Because, Beatrice's expression was, `
`......sorrowful, `
`......or maybe pitying.`
`"You fool, Kinzo......`
`......Can't you see me, even though I am here?"`
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, was the witch herself.`
` And yet, Kinzo didn't notice anything.`
`......When Beatrice tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice anything.`
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach Beatrice's smile?!`
` Is it the age of the moon, `
`the cycle of the comets, `
`the alignment of the planets?!`
` What is lacking, what is, what is?!!"`
`".........It's useless, Kinzo.`
` ...Without love, `
`it cannot be seen."`
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket.`
`......Would he also be able see something that couldn't be seen now, by learning something?`
`"........................`
` Without love, it cannot be seen."`
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more.`
`......The witch could no longer be seen there.`
