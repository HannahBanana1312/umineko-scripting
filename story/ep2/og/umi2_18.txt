`"Where are you, Beatrice!!`
` Show yourself!!`
` Beatriiiiiice!!"`
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel.`
` She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way there would be an answer.`
` After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings corpses were still exposed, and stretched out her arm towards the gold ingot.`
` It was very heavy, but Rosa didn't mind.`
` She wrapped that one up in a blanket, and threw it over her shoulder.`
`"At least..., with just this one......`
` Just this should be worth more than 10 million..."`
`Without letting go of her gun, Rosa also carried the gold.`
`...Her shoulders were screaming. but Rosa didn't mind.`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` It will happen very soon.`
` ...Very soon, the door to the Golden Land, ...will open."`
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!!`
` Where is Beatrice?!`
` Yeah, you know, she's somewhere, right?!`
` You know, right?!`
` Where?!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` I don't kno-w.`
` Even if you don't search for her, you can meet her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch."`
`"Stop that laugh!!`
` ......Aaah, it almost makes me want to laugh!!`
` That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!!`
` I didn't understand, I thought it was a human calling herself a witch, I was wrong!!!"`
`"...That really was a witch!!`
` I won't be fooled by something like that!!`
` You're there, right?!`
` Come out, show yourself!!`
` Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!"`
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon.`
` The door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"............That's right.`
` Isn't that great!`
` I don't mind, throw away the rook!`
` You, woman, are the king that can't even be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has.`
` I'll corner you, Beatriiiiice.`
` Hihahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"At least call me a queen.`
` Hoh, what a brilliant move.`
` So your blood, no, Ushiromiya's blood is bad at giving up."`
`"......How pleasant!`
` Truly an elegant night.`
` Ku-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha...!!"`
`".........Master, Beatrice-sama.`
` It will soon be time for the banquet."`
`"Already?`
` ......That's fast.`
` Every night I pass with you goes by fast,`
` the moon falls like an apple, and the sun leaps out of the river like a small fish."`
`"Shall we go, it is time.`
` ......Stand Battler.`
` It is the beginning of the banquet to celebrate my revival."`
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture, ...no, as my toy.`
` To the dignitaries among witches."`
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and sitting on top of a footrest.`
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ......it was a human.`
` Which was down on all fours......`
`"......Beatrice-sama, your silk dress."`
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host.`
` I will go out first.`
` It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems that she no longer remains."`
`"......She's never around when I want to use her.`
` A completely useless person. `
`.........However, you did well to remain here.`
` ...I'm happy, my friend."`
`"......I am grateful for your words."`
`"Good.`
` Wait downstairs, you two. `
`Genji, good work, set the dress down over there."`
`"......Certainly.`
` .........Well then, Master."`
`"We will go first.`
` ...Beatrice, I will see you later."`
`"Hmm."`
`Kinzo and Genji left the study.`
` After that, the witch and the dress and the furniture remained.`
`".........Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?"`
`"........................"`
`"It's because you are furniture.`
` Fu-rniture.`
` Understand?`
` Furniture, just fu-rniture! `
`Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture?`
` So there is no reason for me to feel shame because of you.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`When the witch stood up, her jacket slipped off, just from her shoulders.`
`......After that, the jacket fell to the ground with a thump.`
` When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up those clothes, the witch gave it a small kick and it fell over.`
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it had shown...`
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself? `
`......Stand.`
` And undo the buttons.`
` ...One by one, politely.`
` Quickly.`
` Beautifully.`
` With no mistakes.`
` The guests are being kept waiting, change my clothes quickly."`
`"...............Yes..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!`
` Undo them politely.`
` Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs.`
` ...If you make a mistake and break them, I'll sow your eyeballs in instead...`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The entrance hall was bustling with a large number of people's shadows.`
` And it was sparkling gold with the gold butterflies flying around.`
` The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats.`
` At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball.`
` But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre.`
`......Because all of them, ...had goat heads.`
` I don't know whether it was a goat mask masquerade, `
`.........or whether they really had goat heads.`
`...It probably couldn't be the latter, but in this bizarre world, I really didn't know which was true...`
` Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them.`
` Kinzo's greetings were more respectful than would have been expected, as though these were all honored guests.`
` At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall.`
` It was a voice calling for silence.`
` That voice stopped the voices of idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji.`
`".........Tonight marks the entrance of our Golden Witch, who had achieved her revival, `
`the Lady Beatrice.`
` Everyone, please welcome her with your applause."`
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests, and became thunderous applause.`
` And, .........the Golden Witch appeared from the top of the large staircase...`
` As she gracefully waved her hand, ...followed by the furniture she liked, she slowly descended the staircase...`
` The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long-forgotten language.`
` And those who were deeply intimate embraced, filled with joy at their reunion.`
` As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time.`
`.........There were chains around its neck.`
` These were gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog.`
` The chains weren't there to restrain it.`
`...The chains were a restraining device whose only purpose was to injure the furniture's dignity...`
` He wasn't permitted to wear anything else on his body.`
` One of the young woman goats mixed in with the goat nobles,`
` softly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and spoke with eyes that had no light in them.`
` That face, ...looked like it belonged to a long-haired, young girl...`
`"............How pitiful."`
`"O-h, Lady Bernkastel.`
` Welcome.`
` Do you like my furniture?"`
`".........That's a nice hobby."`
`After saying only that, the witch called Bernkastel once again put on her goat mask,`
` and was sucked in by the shadows of the other tall goats...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha...`
` Sore loser.`
` She's irritated."`
`"You're right.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high-pitched laugh.`
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake!!`
` Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this 'banquet of the witch', where old friends have gathered from past and present. east and west...!"`
`"Come, we will eat all night, `
`drink all night, `
`slurp all night, `
`and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!!`
` Look at the clock, it shows the time when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together, ......come!!`
` Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!"`
`When the witch proclaimed the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out...`
`"Come......, now is the time!!`
` Open the golden door............!!!"`
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room.`
` Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold-colored light, the cross-section of this world and a different world, ......was cut open......`
` Amidst the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped, `
`......and the members of the household that praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch scattered into gold butterflies, `
`......and poured out of the depths of hell...`
` It was, ...a golden, ...tornado.`
`...A rondo of golden demons.`
` Come, tonight we will put aside rank.`
` Throw open the wine cellar, `
`drop the snake's head into the liquor pot, `
`throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive, `
`drink and eat and sing and dance, `
`sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!!`
`"Aaaaaahh, Beatrice!!`
` Take me to the Golden Land now!`
` To the Golden Laaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!!`
` Oooooooooohhhhhhhhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"`
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo.`
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the signature of some famous movie star.`
` There were two differences.`
` First, they were witches, not kids.`
` And second, what the witches demanded were not signatures.`
` The sea of goat nobles began to drown Kinzo.`
` Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area.`
` It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes.`
` And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread.`
` An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits! `
`The voice of his death throes lingered on sweetly, `
`if you adorn melted chocolate with a golden argent, it would be a wonderful dessert! `
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them in a soup, `
`and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with, `
`and they could also become good tools for fortune-telling that always gave misfortune! `
`That entire scene, ......was watched by the furniture.`
` It was all fantastical.`
` ...It was all demonic.`
`...Was the quaking of its heart, which should have been paralyzed, ... proof that it could still feel fear? `
`At that time, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body fell onto the center of the carpet.`
` Because the witch had kicked those knees from behind.`
`"Kneel and show your respect.`
` Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are.`
` Put your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me."`
`"..................u, ............ah........."`
`The furniture let out a painful voice.`
`...Fear is the most basic emotion humans have.`
`...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been killed?`
`".........Hmph.`
` So, you are still far from being appropriate for my furniture. `
`Good!`
` I will carefully finish you, to make you the kind of furniture I like, the kind appropriate only for me.`
` ...Is the best you can do now simply entertaining the guests?!"`
`The goat nobles were surrounding the crouching furniture...`
` It seemed that their blazing, blood-red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food that they had been given.`
` And from the ugly teeth that stuck out of countless mouths, saliva, `
`...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, dribbled down...`
`".........e, .........eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"`
`As the furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside.`
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in...`
` And the furniture looked at the witch's face.`
`...It had surrendered to the witch, so believing that the witch would have some compassion, it stared at her face in the end.`
` But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing the furniture anymore.`
` The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes...`
` The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture.`
` They had truly been waiting.`
` Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne, `
`before bringing the offering served at the banquet to their mouths, they were waiting for just one of those.`
` Of course, the furniture didn't know about those.`
`...But it came out of his mouth all by itself.`
` Just like there is certainly a pop when the cork comes out, it certainly came out of his mouth.`
`"...G, `
`......yaa, `
`...ahiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`――A scream.`
` It was a sign that the modest banquet at which he was to be served, ...had begun.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`gebukikyakyakaku`
`oooogaageoe`
`ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!!!"`
`Gabubogyagukigukiboryu.`
` By now the rose garden was a garden of roses and gold.`
` A gold-colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, and gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly.`
`"Maria, quickly!!`
` Run!!`
` Quickly quickly quickly quickly!!"`
`Rosa held onto the blanket wrapped around the ingot and the gun,`
` and ran at a speed Maria couldn't catch up with, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster.`
` Therefore, she saw it every time.`
`...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion! `
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!! `
`And strange-looking shadows with goat heads were chasing after them...!! `
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes.`
` Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured.`
`"......Mama, wait, `
`Mama, wait, `
`...uu-uu-, `
`......ow!!"`
`Maria fell down.`
` For just an instant, Rosa was ashamed by her thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, and at the instant her feet touched ground, she ran back.`
` The goat head that had sprinted over to get the first bite, `
`grabbed hold of the back of Rosa's own child's hair and pulled up...!!`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, `
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`Rosa rammed into the goat head with her shoulder, `
`spun, `
`bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw, `
`and buried her knee into its protruding chest!! `
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut!`
`"......Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me.`
` I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is."`
`The blast from the Winchester's 45 caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat head's throat, `
`and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized.`
` The goat head hadn't understood.`
` It had thought that women were like already opened wine bottles!`
` It had thought that they were wine bottles, and that turning them upside down would immediately cause their deep-red contents to come out!`
`"Mama!!`
` Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`Maria, who had been released, hugged Rosa.`
` But the pursuers were still coming!`
` They could see the giant goat heads, who had given up pretending to be human, running towards them from across the rose bushes.`
` Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up.`
`"Y, yes...!`
` Pick up, pick up...!!"`
`"Maria.`
` If Mama falls down, `
`run.`
` Go to the shore.`
` And swim, and swim, and swim!`
` There's no place on this island that we can survive on!!"`
`"N, no!! `
`Together with Mama!!`
` Uuu--!!"`
`Rosa's gun roared four times.`
` But even though four shots really did hit the massive, approaching goats in the chest, they didn't even flinch!! `
`The goats ran with a violent vigor, as though they planned to crush Rosa and Maria with those massive bodies!!`
`"Put the bullet in!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"U, uu-!!"`
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands, `
`and she herself sprinted, pulling it along!!`
` Without even an ounce of fear of those strange-looking giants!! `
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!!`
`"I'll show you...`
` This golden dreeeeeeeeeeam!!!"`
`Rosa's roar.`
` The goat heads' roar.`
` The terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a terrible centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the head of the goat head.`
` Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket.`
` But she held it crooked.`
` She placed it in her palm, `
`in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like it was a stinger growing out of her fist.`
` That stinger sliced into the left eye of the goat head as it fell over.`
` Was the goat head's roar a scream? `
`But Rosa's roar was different.`
` She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat head's eye.`
` The pointed tip was gouged into the depths of its head...!`
`"Mama, put bullet in!!"`
`"Good job!!"`
`When Rosa grabbed the gun Maria had thrown, the giant finally tumbled on the ground with a thunderous crash.`
` However, at the same time, I saw the goat head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number.`
` I've gained enough distance for now! `
`I held onto the blanket wrapped around the ingot and the gun, and once again ran with Maria.`
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left? `
`Why don't I let go with one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!! `
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body.`
` I can't let go of the gold that protects my future.`
` But even so, I let go of the hand of my daughter, the person who is my future...?! `
`Run.`
` Run. Run.`
` She got out of the rose garden and began to run down a staircase through a grove of trees.`
` But Rosa knew.`
` This path through the grove turned and twisted many times, and only seemed long.`
` She tore straight through it! `
`She had always played here since she was a kid.`
` So she knew! `
`To the beach. To the beach.`
` To the sea, to the sea, to the sea.`
` And after reaching the sea? `
`Nothing to do but swim, swim, swim, if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!! `
`There is nothing but death on this island!`
`"Kya!!!"`
`"Mamaaaa?!"`
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step.`
` A violent pain ran up her left ankle and her mind went completely blank.`
` Rosa fell down several stairs, shocked by her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle.`
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there.`
` She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness.`
` Only the gun was left.`
` Tremors in the earth were getting closer.`
` It was only a matter of time before the goat heads flooded in.`
` She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look.`
` The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived.`
` The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, waving and clamoring as though saying 'the prize is here, the prize is here'.`
` Rosa couldn't even try to get up.`
` The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments.`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing...`
` I'd had the gold, which would have been worth several million yen.`
` I might have been able to start over with that!!`
` And yet I fell, lost it, and that's not all, my own life is in danger, even Maria's life is in danger?!`
`......What has my life been?!!! `
`I was born in an incomprehensible house! `
`With an irritating older brother and sister since the day I was born!! `
`What did I do?! `
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!! `
`What has my life been?!?!`
`"Mama..., Mama, Mama...!!"`
`"..............."`
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared.`
`...It disappeared when she listened to Maria's crying voice, as she sobbed and clung onto Rosa.`
`".........Maria. `
`Mama remembered that there's something she has to do.`
` Please go on ahead."`
`"No, no no no no!! `
`Want to be with Mama!!`
` Don't want Mama to die!!"`
`"Maria, `
`...even though I'm such a bad Mama, `
`......you still say you want to be with Mama?"`
`"Yes...!`
` ......Want to be with Mama..., `
`want to be with Mama...!"`
`"...I made it look like I was putting you first, `
`...but I was always putting you off.`
` I went to your athletic meet, `
`I went to parent's day, `
`...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes.`
` ......Are you saying, ...that you even want to be together with that kind of Mama......?`
` Even though, `
`......I've been such a bad Mama............!!"`
`"Hey, Mama.`
` ...Did you know?`
` There is only one Mama in this world.`
` There's no good Mama or bad Mama.`
` ...There's just one Mama.`
` So for Maria, it's alright if there's only one Mama in the world.`
` And Maria wants to become the only Maria for Mama."`
`".........The Maria who's in a good mood that you want to spoil, and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around, aren't different people.`
` Maria is also just one Maria.`
` ......So both the scary Mama and the nice Mama are together. `
`......To Maria, `
`...there is just one `
`......Mama......"`
`"...............I was, `
`......such, `
`............an idiot...`
`.........I didn't need gold.`
` If only I had just pulled your hand...`
`......I was such, `
`......a stupid Mama...!!"`
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more than the trees of the forest.`
` Their roars blotted out the world with fear.`
` Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand.`
`"Maria, let's go together.`
` Always together. `
`...So that Mama doesn't get lost, always together...!"`
`"Yes...!!`
` Be able to meet soon.`
` Always together...!!`
` ...Be able to meet, in the Golden Land...!! `
`And then we'll play together!`
` Play with the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'!!`
` Mama hasn't solved more than one question, but Maria has solved them all.`
` So Maria will be the questioner!!"`
`She had bought that as a birthday present, ......and then hadn't played it for Maria after that night.`
`"Yes, let's play, together!!!`
` I promise!!!"`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Those eyes, sparkling like red-hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies.`
` They danced, closed in, and attacked.`
`"Oooooooooooooohh, come ooooooon!! `
`Let the one of you that wants to eat this bullet Maria chambered for me come forwaaaaaaard, `
`uwooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"`
