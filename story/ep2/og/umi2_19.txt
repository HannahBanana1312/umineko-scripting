`"........................"`
`Rosa awoke from her doze.`
`......It must have been a very deep sleep.`
` Her mind was hazy and she wasn't thinking clearly.`
` Where is this...? `
`It felt like some mansion, but at least it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
` She could see a room that looked like a parlor.`
`......And there was some tea that had been prepared.`
` It had probably been prepared for her.`
` Around the room, some glitter that looked like gold leaf drifted about, making the scene look very fantastical.`
`...When she eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, it further strengthened this impression.`
` There was someone across from her.`
`......Female.`
` ......A woman.`
`.........The portrait's, `
`...witch.`
` She seemed to be having a one-sided conversation.`
` She was probably talking to Rosa, `
`but Rosa, whose mind was clouded up by a deep fog, didn't have a clue what was being said...`
`"......Anything is fine.`
` If there is anything you want, I'll give you it all.`
` You can think of it as my reward for your good luck, and as a proper trade for my demands."`
`"It probably isn't that big a thing for you at all.`
` However, that is the only meaningful transaction as far as I am concerned."`
`............What is she, ...talking about.`
`...I don't know, `
`...I don't know.`
`"It's just that, ......I am very much a witch.`
` I think it would be wise to ask for something that only a witch can grant."`
`"Isn't this a rare chance.`
` You can actually receive a favor from me, Beatrice the Golden.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"..................u........."`
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body.`
`...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking.`
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch.`
` Bestowing a mountain of gold, like I gave to Kinzo, is no problem for me.`
` ......In any event, you can convert all pleasures of the human world into money.`
` Therefore, gold is equal to all the pleasures of the human world."`
`"Can you imagine?`
` A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived."`
`As the witch blew on her pipe, seven colors of smoke wrapped around the surroundings.`
` When she did, the inside of the parlor, ...had suddenly become filled with stacks of gold ingots.`
` It looked like a shining gold-colored wall.`
`...If each ingot was worth several ten million yen,`
` how much would all of this be worth? `
`It seemed sinful to even think of that number.`
`"......However, the human world is difficult.`
` I know that there are some things that cannot be satisfied no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold.`
` I know that there are cracks that can't be filled.`
` I won't make light of that, which is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give."`
`"......Why don't I fill those cracks in for you?`
` Yes, how about this.`
` It's something that only I can give.`
` You should be very happy."`
`"......You don't have to say it out loud.`
` I can understand it right away, it's written on your face and in the corners of your heart, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch, `
`who kept on talking even though Rosa hadn't uttered a single word, `
`but since she still couldn't speak well, and was so helpless that it was difficult for her even to move a finger, `
`she couldn't do anything but listen.`
`"How far must the deep wounds in your heart recede before they can be healed? `
`.........This is, `
`.........deep, `
`deep.`
` ......Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of something is still inside.`
` ...Even when those wounds appear to have healed, they will continue to throb for all eternity.`
` Sometimes you have to open the wound once to completely heal it."`
`As the witch spoke, she stared deep into Rosa's eyes.`
`......What in the world, ...was she peering at? `
`Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away.`
`"............So your pain, is being stuck with a fate from the time you were born.`
` ...How heart-breaking.`
` ...You don't have to say it.`
` I understand.`
` ......I understand......"`
`Then, Rosa was once again sucked into the witch's eyes.`
` Then, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in...`
` Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Krauss nii-san's voice.`
` Krauss nii-san is a real adult, so he's very smart.`
` So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
` He was a very scary person. I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken.`
` It had seemed like I was being punished for something bad I'd done, but I hadn't really understood what it was, or why I was being punished.`
` I was always punished suddenly and then later told what the punishment was for, in a forced manner,`
` but it was always something I didn't remember doing.`
`......So I really hated Krauss nii-san.`
` Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Eva nee-san's voice.`
` Eva nee-san is a real adult, so she's very smart.`
` So she hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
` She was always a very sly person, and she often lied to me, tricked me, bullied me all time.`
` It had seemed like I was stupid, and she said it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those better than them.`
` So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee-san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me.`
`......So I really hated Eva nee-san.`
` Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii-san's voice.`
` Rudolf nii-san really knows how to get things done.`
` So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
` When Krauss nii-san was around, he was friendly with Krauss nii-san.`
` When Eva nee-san was around, he was friendly with Eva nee-san.`
`...And when Krauss nii-san wasn't around, he was violent like Krauss nii-san, `
`and when Eva nee-san wasn't around he played dirty like Eva nee-san.`
` And even though he was also bullied most of the time, `
`when Krauss nii-san and Eva nee-san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying.`
`......So I really hated Rudolf nii-san.`
`......Oh, but this is my memory from when I was a kid.`
` A large amount of unreasonable things happened when I was a kid.`
` And that couldn't be dragged out forever.`
` With time, those memories were buried away, and forgetting those bit by bit was supposed to be part of growing up and becoming an adult.`
` So becoming an adult is the same thing as separating yourself from all of those memories.`
` Therefore.`
` No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult.`
`......Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother, `
`...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult.`
` The witch pitied that.`
` And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself.`
`"......How could I heal you?`
` It's possible, but not easy.`
` ...I could even rewind time, and give you a world where you have no older siblings."`
`"But that way, your 'memories of being hurt by your older siblings' wouldn't remain,`
` and in that sense, while you could call it a gift, you wouldn't be able to accept it."`
`"If starvation is healed, that person is satisfied.`
` Even if you erase starvation itself, no one will thank you.`
` Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony.`
` ......Understand?"`
`I think she's telling me something really complicated.`
`...In short, even if she makes it so that I never had older siblings, the pain wouldn't be removed, `
`maybe that's what she's saying.`
` Strictly speaking, it's different.`
` Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain.`
` It's the pleasure earned from withstanding pain.`
` Therefore, removing the pain isn't healing.`
` To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain.`
`"In that case, ......there is joy as a reward for your pain.`
` You can boast of the suffering in your past.`
` Because you are qualified to know a kind of pleasure that those who have not known suffering cannot taste.`
` ...Those that have known this pleasure, cannot help but give the same joy to other people...`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold and had already lost all semblance of reality, `
`a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table,`
` and wonderful cooking was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale.`
` For an instant, Rosa felt a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was, `
`...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax.`
` Because she thought that being bullied by her siblings`
` wouldn't be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious.`
`"Food contains many of the human pleasures.`
` You must eat like a pig as long as you live."`
`"If one meal isn't enough, then as many as you want.`
` Until the pain of your heart is healed, why not continue this gourmet banquet?`
` ......Begin it, furniture."`
`As the witch clapped twice, `
`there were suddenly two goat head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal.`
` From the beautiful food dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate.`
` It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead,`
` and there was no way she could eat.`
` Maybe they also understood that.`
` The goat head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar, `
`and gallantly brought a glass of before-dinner alcohol to her mouth, tilting it for her.`
` She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever.`
` She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth.`
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German-made wine.`
` A wine cocktail of white wine mixed with a crimson golden drop."`
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss. `
`Soaked with just a golden drop of your brother's blood that was squeezed out of a compressor."`
` `
`Rosa coughed violently.`
` And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood.`
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right?`
` 'Golden drop' refers to the last drop.`
` It is called the most precious drop in black tea."`
`".........So a golden drop of blood is the same.`
` The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human.`
` It's squeezed with that."`
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil that had been set up before something large was removed.`
`......The solemn and massive machine there was just like `
`a coffin for a large-sized person, with many large bulb-like things stuck to it, `
`and it looked like a sinister torture device.`
` By its unnerving shape, `
`she could tell that with a human's strength, it could tighten and compress something.`
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining, `
`...because of the bright red remains that stained it.`
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once.`
` No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop. `
`But I am a witch.`
` It is also easy to revive a person."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, suddenly, the human compressor began to shake.`
`...No, she could also hear a groan.`
`......It looked almost as though, someone had been sleeping in that man-sized coffin, `
`had woken up, and was now struggling to get out.`
` But that was wrong.`
` What was inside had definitely been squeezed dregs.`
` Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they had been before they were squeezed.`
` Three goat head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor, and forcefully started tightening the large bulb.`
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from the inside of the coffin.`
`...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice.`
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen.`
` That is enough, stand back."`
`"......Do you understand how precious a golden drop is?`
` To have it stained this crimson requires that several dozen people's worth be squeezed."`
`The witch had definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human.`
` And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human.`
`......Only a witch could do this.`
` The Golden Witch Beatrice could kill a single human 'endlessly'.`
`......In other words, before Beatrice, even death did not mean release.`
`"Do you need me to say it in a different way?`
` Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, and you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?"`
`"That's right, remember that taste.`
` Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry.`
` I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Once again, the goat head servants tilted a deep red glass against her mouth.`
`...Rosa tried resisting by closing her lips, `
`but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which was hanging open with shock,`
` and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness...`
` It was definitely a fragrant sweetness.`
` The living blood of her brother, who had given her such hateful thoughts and made her soak her pillow so many times, `
`had been collected from his death, repeated dozens of times. It wasn't as though the crimson-stained wine wasn't sweet.`
` But Rosa tried to spit it out.`
` Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth looked just like a bloodstain.`
`......Now that she knew that this ghastly substance wasn't a simple aperitif,`
` Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued.`
`"That is a double-tongued salad made from vegetables in season.`
` ...As you hoped you could one day chew to bits on your 9th birthday, here is that salad you desired, made from Eva's tongue."`
`".....................!!!"`
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink-colored meat piled up in the salad,`
` she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out.`
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it, and carried it to Rosa's mouth.`
`"How does your double-tongued sister taste?`
` It must be quite soft and enchanting, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Maybe it was quite sweet, soft and enchanting in her mouth.`
` After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them.`
`...So you could say that the taste of the stimulating pepper seasoning that was added expressed the details of those lies well.`
`"......mnnnnnnnnnnn!! `
`mnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As the tongue salad that kept being pushed into Rosa's mouth was covered with saliva, she spat it out.`
` But the goat head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again.`
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad liberally using five of Eva's tongues.`
` You can't steal more than one out of one tongue.`
` But I can steal it over and over.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!! `
`nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted, half-crazed.`
` However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow.`
` Even if she didn't swallow it, `
`the taste of the french dressing increasingly violated Rosa's mouth...`
`"Does it please you...?`
` There's still much more food.`
` Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face.`
` Soup with boiled brains, liver pate. `
`And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!!`
` It's not just your siblings, see?`
` I have lavishly arranged all of those who you have trusted and yet betrayed you.`
` Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied. `
`For all eternity.`
`......You're happy, right, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa?`
` Don't pretend that you hate it, I know that you're really happy, alright?`
` If you want to laugh, then you can laugh,`
` if you won't feel better until you've heard a raw performance of your annoying older sibling's screams, then I'll let you hear them as often as you want.`
` It's alright that you are so unwilling.`
` That's your personality, right?`
` You're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over. `
`And yet, on the outside, you're just pretending to act like you're in pain? `
`It's alright. Here, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything, `
`so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits.`
` Isn't this the be-st banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???"`
`".........st, `
`.........please, `
`......stop......, `
`...*cough*, *hack*!!`
` eeeeh..."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I kept the dessert a secret to surprise you, but let me reveal it anyways.`
` If I reveal it, maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course."`
`"The dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love,`
` oven-baked Maria and apples.`
` Doesn't that sound yummy?"`
`"If you eat this, you will be released from everything.`
` Freedom, you see, freedom!`
` Finally Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?`
` You should be happy, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooooooooooooooooor, hyahahaaahaahaahaha!!"`
`Suddenly, a muscular goat cook was holding Maria under his arm.`
` And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was only slightly sad.`
`".........Mama...`
`......Was Maria, ......a burden......?"`
`"...nnnnnnn!! `
`You aren't a burden!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth, `
`as she was covered with filth and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed.`
`"......If Mama, `
`...thinks Maria is a burden,`
` ......it's fine if Maria is eaten."`
`".........After all, Maria always does horrible things to Mama.`
` Even when Mama brings a man over, Maria can't stay quiet.`
` When Mama stayed over with a man, Maria got lonely and unruly and made a mess of the room.`
` When Maria went to search by herself, she got lost, the police picked her up and Mama was shamed.`
` Mama, who cried after Maria didn't come home for several days, who had to be consoled by the neighbors, was shamed."`
`"Because Maria's like this, she's an annoyance to Mama.`
` Sorry for being born.`
` So Maria will become delicious oven-baked apples for Mama's sake."`
`"And then, maybe Mama will be happy Maria exists for the first time.`
` Maybe she'll eat Maria and think she's delicious. `
`Isn't it delicioooooooooooooooous?`
` Be choked up with tears of gratitude, your daughter is saying this much for you, riiiiiiiiiiiight?`
` Oven-baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert!`
` You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients, `
`aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???"`
`".........Mama, thanks for everything.`
` Bye bye."`
`"Wait!! `
`Wait, Maria, that's wrong!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already, `
`nooooooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`I didn't want something like this!`
` Please stop, please forgive me!!`
` No, `
`stop it already, `
`don't put it, in my mouth..., `
`uuuuulg, `
`geeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Have you been satisfied with my hospitality...?`
` Then I'll have you accept it.`
` That I am a witch. `
`Proclaim it.`
` 'Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that Beatrice is a witch'!!"`
`"......I accept it!! `
`U, Ushiromiya Rosa, `
`......accepts that, `
`......Beatrice is a witch!!`
` So give Maria back!!`
` Release meeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahahah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!`
` I finally made you accept it!!`
` That crafty Battler has already surrendered, and I made Rosa, the fool who denied me even after being invited to the Golden Land, accept it!!`
` Perfect!!`
` It's perfect!!"`
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!! `
`Ku hahahahahahahahakya-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HA!!`
` Come, bring Maria, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!"`
`"NoooooooooooooooooooooooMariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"Looks delicious. `
`Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich."`
`"Wha, ......th, that voice!!`
` Ooof?!"`
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table.`
` As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a group of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away.`
`"Ba........., Battler?!?! `
`Y, ......you bastard, `
`...you should have surrendered so that even your soul was furniture!!"`
`"I had planned to, `
`...but while I was listening to that gross recipe, I started to get a little hungry."`
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!"`
`"And Maria.`
` It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you. `
`But in ten years, you'll have to say that to me. Promise."`
`"......Uu-.`
` Promise."`
`"Ba, ...Battler-kun...!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Rosa oba-san.`
` I had forgotten.`
` This was a one-on-one fight between me and this woman.`
` I definitely can't give in.`
` ......Thanks to Rosa oba-san's persistence, I've regained my will to fight!!"`
`......Th, ...this person, he gave up in the depths of his soul, and supposedly surrendered to me...`
`......I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild...!`
` So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...!`
`"Fu, fuhahahahahahahahaha, how vigorous, I like it!`
` I wouldn't have it any other way!! `
`I wouldn't have you any other way, Battler!!`
` Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits!`
` Let me make you surrender over and over again. I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over again!!"`
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who'll stand back up even after crawling in the mud!! `
`I've never had the experience of being invincible in a fight.`
` I lost many times. `
`But I'll definitely crawl in the mud and stand up again.`
` Then I'll finish this!!`
` In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!"`
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me.`
` Entertain me, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"`
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!! `
`While we're waiting, why don't you tell me all about it?`
` There were a lot of closed rooms in this game.`
` Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out.`
` What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!!`
` The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!!`
` Use your bizarre specialty, `
`those delusions, rantings, daydreams, and bluffs, `
`all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Aaah, it's useless, `
`it's all useleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeess!!!"`
