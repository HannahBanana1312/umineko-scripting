`".........Who is it?"`
`"Excuse me...`
` I have brought lunch."`
`"Enter."`
`"......Excuse me."`
`After receiving approval, Kanon entered the VIP room, pushing the lunch serving cart.`
`...The servants called this room the witch's VIP room.`
` That was because Kinzo strictly ordered that it always be cleaned so that it could be used at any time.`
`...Even so, guests would not be allowed into this room no matter who they were.`
`...That's why, at some point, the servants had started calling it the VIP room, which was supposed to be set aside only to greet the special person Kinzo waited for...,`
` the witch from that portrait.`
` And today, Kanon knew that this was exactly right...`
` When he entered the room, .........the blonde-haired witch was gazing out the window.`
` Outside, the rain was no longer falling weakly.`
`...As she looked out at the beautiful rose garden, which had been finished after several days of work for today's sake, `
`and saw the winds and rain ravage it, was she lost in some sentimental feelings? `
`Kanon was not able to tell anything more from her back, which was facing him.`
`"...I will prepare the meal.`
` ...Beatrice-sama."`
`Kanon went out of his way to call out the witch's name, ......because he wanted to make her turn around.`
` He wanted to know.`
`......He wanted to know whether the witch who had tempted him and Shannon in the past really had appeared again.`
`...When he did, ......the witch whose name had been called, ......laughed, her back still facing him.`
` Holding back her voice, she laughed.`
` Kanon was startled...`
` It was almost as though she had read his mind and knew that he had called out to her, hoping to make her turn around...`
`".........It smells good.`
` It appears that Krauss has somehow employed a good cook."`
`"...............`
`......Yes.`
` ...He is a cook called Gohda, and was employed in recent years."`
`"...There's nothing better than being skilled at cooking.`
` ...Gourmets form the three pillars of pleasure for living in the human world.`
` Not missing out on this is the secret to not getting bored after a thousand years.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Kanon and the witch's eyes met.`
`...And, she grinned...`
` Without a doubt.`
` Certainly...`
` This was without a doubt, the witch from that day, Beatrice...`
` The witch that no one but he and Shannon could see in the past finally held a form, and had arrived openly as a guest from the entrance hall...`
`".........Beatrice......`
`......sama."`
`"It has been a long time.`
` .........Kanon, the furniture.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............It has, `
`......been a long time..."`
`Kanon tried not to forget to be polite to the guest for the time being.`
`...But dark clouds began to enshroud his heart because of the visit of this suspicious witch, and on the day of the family conference...`
`"It seems you are uneasy about what I plan to do now that I have appeared.`
` ......Is that so...?"`
`"....................."`
`Kanon didn't force an answer.`
`...This witch probably reads minds.`
`...So it was pointless to go to all the trouble of saying it out loud.`
`.........Of course, even his resisting heart would be read.`
` So the witch giggled at Kanon's childish resistance.`
`"......I came to resolve my final promise with Kinzo."`
`"Your final promise with, ......Master...?"`
`"......I lent Kinzo a mountain of gold.`
` ...When Kinzo gives that up, it will be returned to me with interest.`
` .........I came to accept that tonight."`
`".............I don't know what you are talking about."`
`However, uncertainty began to gather in his heart.`
`......The story of this witch couldn't be anything good.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no mistake!`
` The story of a witch isn't anything good.`
` You are correct. `
`Be that as it may, witches are used like scissors.`
` ...Sometimes, there are people like King Solomon who succeed in great exploits."`
`".........However, in most cases, one does not meet with a good fate such as those described in fairy tales, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
` .........But Kinzo is crafty.`
` He has taken in even the interest I am collecting for his own ceremony.`
` Is he an absurd magician to surpass even me?`
` ......Or else a fool possessed by madness?`
` ...Interesting.`
` Truly interesting...!"`
`Kanon couldn't guess what the witch was muttering and laughing about.`
`...All he knew was,`
` ......anything that would make this witch laugh,`
` must have the exact opposite meaning to the rest of them.`
`......And in the back of his mind, the horrifying words the witch had spat at him in the past began to be revived.`
` Did I not lend them that power without asking for compensation?`
` I'll lend a hand in love.`
` So that as compensation, I can enjoy watching the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
` Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!`
`".....................`
`...Could it be, ......you......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Gehehehhahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`".........My beloved hometown, the sweetfish river running through it.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream and seek the key."`
`The witch suddenly began to recite a bizarre poem...`
` It was something he remembered hearing.`
`"Could that be......, ......the witch's epitaph..."`
`There was no mistake.`
`...It was the epitaph that accompanied the portrait of the witch that Kinzo had hung.`
` The relatives imagined that it probably pointed to the location of the hidden gold,`
` but no one knew what it meant.`
` The witch suddenly began reciting that epitaph.`
`"...Kanon.`
` Why don't you, as furniture, ask Kinzo about it?`
` .........The day when everything will be returned to the Golden Land...has come. `
`Rejoice.`
` ...The day when the shame of your time as furniture will end has finally come."`
`"................"`
`"I believe you have wanted that for a long time.`
` ...To furniture, whose existence has no value, just existing day to day must be nothing but agony."`
`"......Those with souls should persist in the real world, but those without them find the real world to be nothing but suffering.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Complicated expressions flitted across Kanon's face.`
`......It was the day of release that Kanon had been looking forward to.`
`...However, the coming of this day had been mercilessly sudden.`
` And for some reason, it was difficult to accept, since he had been informed that the day of resting had come from a witch speaking in this hateful way.`
`...Kanon wasn't even able to decide what emotion he should hold on to...`
`"......Why are you not happy?`
` Could you actually have some regrets left in the real world?`
` ......As furniture?"`
`"............I have no, `
`......regrets.`
` Because I am, `
`............furniture."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...You truly are a model furniture.`
` ......How nice, how nice.`
` ......However, it wouldn't be interesting if you had no regrets."`
`"......Are you saying that regrets are your pleasure?"`
`"That is correct!`
` Most witches who live for one thousand years get tired of living!`
` In order to escape boredom, I adorn people's fates with fruit and brandy and cook them like cakes.`
` I find humans dancing through oppressive fates inside an oven to be so very entertaining...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It's well known that I take this position, right?`
` ......So much that rare guests come from far away to see my skill at cooking.`
` ...Heheheheh, even if I say that, it may be something that mere furniture can't understand."`
`Kanon wasn't able to understand what the witch was saying.`
` However, he realized well enough that this was a terrifying being who treated the fate of humans as a show,`
` enjoying it whenever some harm befell them.`
`......However, furniture had no soul or life, much less a fate.`
` Pitiful "furniture" did nothing but serve until the day they were released from the real world.`
`...To furniture like that, the witch, who had appeared to release them from everything, was a being for which they overflowed with affection...`
` Even though the day that Kanon should have been waiting impatiently for had come, he was confused at himself and his inability to easily accept that.`
`...Why was it...?`
`.........The face of Shannon, the person he loved as a sister, rose to his mind.`
`......And for some reason, Jessica's face did too.`
`"...............Ku."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip painfully.`
`......What Jessica was thinking of was not permitted for furniture.`
` Even though he had tried to realize that, and had found fault with Shannon's relationship, ......how could he still remember Jessica at a time like this.`
`......He felt a little shameful at his own naivety.`
` And to forget about Jessica, he turned his thoughts to Shannon.`
` Shannon is also furniture.`
`......On the day everything returns to nothing, there was no reason she shouldn't be happy.`
`......But Shannon, `
`.........through her relationship with George, had known an emotion that shouldn't be known by furniture.`
` Even though she wasn't qualified to be bonded with him, she was still trapped in a dream that she wasn't permitted to see.`
` Could Shannon, `
`......accept something like that with pleasure?`
`......She must not.`
`...Shannon still had remaining regrets.`
`......That would probably become a great source of pain and torture for Shannon.`
` And the fact of the matter was that this regret, .........had been planted by this witch.`
` Why?`
` Just because that would be 'more interesting'......!`
`"......This day, ......that Shannon should have been waiting impatiently for, will probably force upon her very harsh thoughts, `
`......and give her emotions that she must not know. `
`.........I thank you for bringing me, ...us furniture the day of our release as a present."`
`"......And, I hate you for making this day difficult for Shannon to accept...!"`
`"I wanted to make you feel pain from your regrets as well, just like Shannon.`
` ......However, you continued to be like furniture with foolish honesty, and didn't get ensnared by me."`
`".........However, it looks like you loved Shannon too dearly, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Shannon's regrets became your regrets.`
` ......Will that become hatred for me...?"`
`"........................"`
`"If you want to kill me, try to do it.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` As Kinzo's furniture, you should have at least that much power, right?`
` However, if you kill me, the day of rest for the furniture will not come for all eternity.`
` ......Could you withstand that......?`
` Can you really reject your release by me......?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`.........Kneel!"`
`"Wh, ......what...!"`
`"Kneel and kiss my shoes.`
` .........Otherwise, I will leave this place.`
` ...I'll go back and never show myself again for all eternity. `
`............So, Kanon?`
` Could you withstand that...?"`
`"...............Ku......"`
`"If the door to the Golden Land is opened, your life as furniture that has been full of hardship will end.`
` ......If you desire, I will even give you life as a human.`
` After that, you will be on the same level as Jessica!`
` Surely you want to know of it, the taste of love...!"`
`".........I know even if you try to hide it, you see...?`
` After seeing Shannon indulging in the sea of sweet love, you grew jealous.`
` ...You are sorely tempted to know the taste of love...`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Stop it......, stop it...!`
` Are you trying to ensnare me again......?!`
` I won't be reduced to a toy to please you...!"`
`"Hoh.`
` Then I will be satisfied with Shannon.`
` You weren't the only one I sowed those seeds into.`
` There are sometimes fruits that don't bear fruit."`
`".........He who lays hand upon the key shall travel under the rules below.`
` At the first twilight, you shall lift up as sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
` At the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close..."`
`The witch recited the epitaph again.`
` It was so sudden, and diverged so strongly from the current topic.`
` However, that challenging smile made it seem almost as though she were using that epitaph as a threat to Kanon.`
`".........Do you not understand?`
` ...For the ceremony of the epitaph to succeed, at the 'second twilight', the two who are close must be offered as sacrifices. `
`............It could be any two who are close.`
` A husband and wife, or even a pair of lovers.`
` ......According to the rules of the ceremony, who will be selected is up to me to decide on a whim.`
` ......Don't you think that there is no one more fitting to be a sacrifice for the second twilight than Shannon as she is now...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle!!"`
`".........Wh, ......what a dirty........."`
`Kanon knew.`
`...Until today, he had planned on giving everything up and living as furniture, like furniture.`
`...But in reality, that wasn't true.`
` He loved Shannon too dearly.`
`...Therefore, when Shannon was in pain, Kanon shared in that.`
` If only Shannon had continued to live as furniture, `
`indifferently like Kanon, without any regrets in this world, he wouldn't have had to be in so much pain...! `
`The witch planned to toy with Shannon, who had known the taste of love..., `
`no, who she had taught the taste of love, as she killed her.`
` Being released along with her love meant that she wouldn't be invited to the Golden Land, `
`but would become a human sacrifice for an evil ceremony, after receiving the limits of torture and pain...! `
`And this witch would probably make Shannon actually meet this horrible fate for no reason other than that it was interesting to her.`
`......Furthermore, she was threatening to do that so that she could make Kanon, who hadn't submitted to the witch even once until now, finally surrender......`
` It was that simple.`
` ...In the end, though he had tried resisting the witch to avoid pleasing her, he had only made things interesting for her.`
`......After all, he was furniture.`
` No, a toy.`
` ......They were nothing but toys meant only to distract her from her boredom...!`
`"............Da......mn..............."`
`"What will you do, Kanon...?`
` If you kneel, I'll surely hold back from choosing Shannon as a sacrifice, okay?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've wanted to make a toy like you surrender just once. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kuhihihihihihihihi!!"`
`Without even a fragment of elegance, the witch sneered at Kanon with an indecent laugh.`
`...That's right, she had seen through Kanon even faster than he had been able to make up his own mind...`
`".................................Ku..."`
`......Kanon, ...............chose to get down on both knees in front of the witch...`
` It didn't matter what happened to himself.`
`...However, ......just the fact that Shannon, `
`who during his days as furniture had given him his only reason to live, was being toyed with,`
` ......that alone was something that he couldn't overlook...`
` Therefore, `
`......something like kissing the shoes of the witch, ...was an easy oath for Kanon to make.`
`......At the time that his quivering lips actually touched the witch's shoe...`
`...Beatrice, after letting a look of ecstasy rise to her face, ...laughed with a voice filled to bursting.`
` At that moment, the witch, who had been bored of living after one thousand years, was completely filled with that evil emotion which was what she lived for......`
` When lunch ended, the relatives moved to the parlor.`
` Rosa had bought a high-class brand of black tea from a famous store in Ginza.`
` That had been prepared, and the inside of the parlor was filled with a very nice aroma...`
` Since the children were together with the adults,`
` the adults tried to interact like relatives on the surface, talking peacefully about recent events and how their children were growing up.`
` It had started raining outside, `
`so the children couldn't do anything but sit here like this, watching TV, unable to go outside.`
` Maria continued watching a boring daytime program without getting bored, `
`going kyakkya all by herself, like a TV kid.`
` At first, Battler joined in, apparently deepening his relationship with Maria,`
` but he had gotten up early that morning, and was therefore attacked by a wave of drowsiness...`
`"......Fuaaaaaah..."`
`"Oh, that's a big yawn.`
` Did you get up really early this morning?"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` With all the tension resolved, I started to get sleepy, listening to the sound of the rain."`
`"Tension?`
` Hehe, you call overreacting that much tension?"`
`"At least it's like that for me. `
`......Fuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah......"`
`Battler gave a great yawn once again, and slowly lay down in the sofa.`
` He really did look tired.`
` George and the others had tried talking to him, thinking it was a sign of boredom, but when they realized he really was sleepy, they decided to let him be.`
`"My, my.`
` They say that if you lie down right after eating, you'll become a mackerel.`
` Hoh-hoh-ho...!"`
`"......Stop kidding around.`
` Gohda-san said that tonight would be calf steak.`
` That would make it mackerel steak."`
`"Kumasawa-san.`
` This guy looks pretty tired.`
` Would you mind bringing him a blanket?"`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho.`
` Here you go."`
`Kumasawa brought a blanket over from the shelf.`
`...The wide parlor wasn't cold, but the air had gotten a little chilly.`
` So when Battler took the blanket, he immediately wrapped himself up in it, like a little turtle.`
`"...You really were sleepy.`
` When will you wake up?`
` I'll take care of it."`
`"......Nah, I'm not really hoping for anything.`
` ......You can wake me up if you have some business with me,`
` ...and if there's nothing, you can let me sleep forever.`
` ......Good night..."`
`"Uu-?`
` Battler sleep? `
`A nap?`
` A nap?`
` Uu-uu-, Maria will do it too!"`
`"H, hey, Maria.`
` Battler's sleepy, so you gotta leave him alone.`
` Kumasawa-san, could you give us another blanket?"`
`It was doubtful that Maria really wanted to take a nap.`
` She probably saw Battler wrapped up in a blanket and wanted to do the same.`
` When she received the blanket from Kumasawa, she joyfully wrapped herself up in it and set up camp again in front of the TV.`
`"Sheesh.`
` ...Even though we've finally gathered all the cousins together after six years.`
` This guy doesn't have a clue that he's the main guest of this family conference, does he?"`
`"......I can hear you-.`
` ...I've casually eaten lunch, and there's even a typhoon and rain.`
` ......Since we aren't doing anything, that means it isn't my turn yet."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` If you have a passive attitude like that, and don't do anything unless something happens, your life will be pretty boring, right?"`
`"......Wrong, that's not what I mean.`
` ...How should I say it?`
` ...In times like this, I've decided to think this way.`
` ......It isn't my turn.`
` If this were a play, it wouldn't be my turn to go on stage.`
` ......So the best thing to do is stay on the wings of the stage."`
`"You're always the main character of your own life, right?`
` Why are you acting like a supporting actor?`
` ...You have to move forward by yourself and get up on the stage."`
`".........That's not what I mean.`
` What I'm mean by saying that it's not my turn now...`
` Kuaaaaaaaaaaah......`
` Sorry, my mind's a mess.`
` Give me a break......`
` Munyamunya......"`
`"Seriously.`
` You're so sleepy that you aren't making any sense.`
` ...We'll leave you alone now."`
`"I think that's inexcusable.`
` ...You are always the main character in your own life.`
` But I kinda want to seriously argue with Battler about that!"`
`"He's just half-asleep.`
` Don't take him too seriously."`
`".........You know what?`
` I think he's got that kind of personality where he doesn't want to get up on the stage because he can't be the main character.`
` ......Something about that pisses me off..."`
`With distant eyes, Jessica gazed out the window at the gray rose garden obscured by rain...`
` When she put her forehead up against the glass, it felt as though the pleasantly cool sensation chased away the memories that she didn't want to remember...`
`"............What do you mean it's still not your turn?`
` ...Then, ......when will you get up on the stage......?"`
`In that case, who are you saying is the main character on stage...?`
`".........Can't you just do what you want already?`
` ...What is this?`
` ......It's all screwed up...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` It's because your argument regarding 18 or 19 people, which you are using as a basis to deny me, is truly humorous.`
` So much so that I tried changing my move."`
`"...The greatest basis upon which you deny me is simply because I was not laid out as a piece on the game board.`
` So doing this is nothing more than showing you the queen first, isn't it?`
` ...Isn't opening the road for the queen in the first move one of the short-cuts in chess?"`
`".........Q, ...quit playing around...`
` There's no way, ...I can accept something like this, right?!`
` A witch came in, walking right through the entrance hall, you say?! `
`Don't mess with me!!"`
`"What's this...?`
` In the last game, I let you make your moves terribly freely, right...?`
` This time, I am doing nothing more than matching your moves and moving the pieces.`
` .........Will you give in already after the first move...?"`
`"......Y, .........you bastard...`
` Don't mess with me!`
` Who's gonna give in!`
` Great move, why don't you just move however you like?"`
`"I see, so your turn is far from over.`
` ...Move however you like!`
` Form a huge battle formation while you can."`
`"I will definitely defy you.`
` I'll definitely corner you!!`
` Come at me as best you can, I don't want you to have any excuses."`
`"......This much isn't even close to enough to make me accept something like a witch.`
` ...That's right, just now, it looked like Maria's candy was fixed with magic, `
`but you might have actually had another one of the same candy hidden in your pocket, and switched them with that little show, making it only look like you had fixed it with magic!`
` Yeah, that's right, that has to be it, it's useless, it's all useless...!"`
`"......Hohoh?`
` Rosa saw the moment when the candy split into butterflies, right?"`
`"I don't know about that!!`
` That was a hallucination or a trick, ...otherwise, she just saw it wrong!!`
` That isn't a big problem!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` So you throw out the part you can't explain as trivial?`
` ......I see, is that your move in response to mine...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*..., you've really put your foot in it.`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` Fuhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It still isn't your turn yet.`
` Allow me to make my move for a little longer.`
` It has barely begun, the Turn of the Witch!!"`
`When they started hearing Battler's snores, the relatives went their separate ways, leaving the parlor and letting Battler sleep in silence.`
` Even though it had been so lively in the parlor with so many people gathered there,`
` ......when all of them scattered at once and were sucked into the vast mansion, it created an eerie silence, with no sound except that of the rain...`
`"Nope.`
` I haven't met a person like that even once.`
` Aneki?"`
`"...I haven't met them.`
` ......Kyrie-san, is that true?"`
`"......Even I only greeted her quickly when she came into the entrance hall.`
` She looked like she was in her twenties.`
` I told her my name, but she didn't tell me hers.`
` ...She was being guided by Genji-san and I saw her go up to the second floor."`
`"So it would probably be faster to find Genji-san and hear the story from him directly.`
` ......Still, what a strange turn of affairs..."`
`The mystery woman had spoken to Kyrie.`
` Without naming herself, she had sneered that Kyrie should have had a vague idea.`
`......And the person that brought to mind...`
`...was her look-alike, the witch of the portrait...`
`"Was this person trying to say that she was, `
`......the witch of the portrait?"`
`"I realized that was what she was laughing at.`
` ......Even though it was our first meeting, she spoke as though she knew I'm your second wife."`
`"......Aneki.`
` You really don't know someone like that?"`
`"You talk too much.`
` I have never seen a blonde woman like that go in or out of this mansion!"`
`"That kind of thing doesn't matter.`
` ...The problem is what happens if that woman starts calling herself Beatrice, if she starts calling herself the manager of Father's assets."`
`"Or, ...maybe she plans to call herself his mistress's daughter, and demand that the inheritance be distributed to her.`
` ...Either way, an outrageous joker has been slipped into the deck. `
`.........Did Nii-san call her?`
` ...Or did Father...?"`
`"This is bad.`
` ...We've been thinking that if we did a good enough job cornering Aniki in our discussion, we might be able to work things out.`
` ......But this takes us back to square one."`
`".........`
`...I don't know what kind of schemes you've been making when I'm not around, dear,`
` ......but it looks like we've been given a little time to form a counter-strategy."`
`"...Yeah.`
` The little time that we've been given to discuss a counter-strategy `
`is better than what would have happened if that blonde-haired nee-chan had suddenly appeared at the dinner table and scared the shit out of us."`
`"...Our effective counter-stategies will be limited as long as we don't know what she came to do.`
` ......What could she be after...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious!`
` It's to claim that they are the rightful heir to Father's inheritance!`
` Father is still captivated by Beatrice.`
` If that girl were here, you would think he'd want to give up all of his assets!`
` She might even thrust some strange will before us!"`
`"...For that, if we take it to court, we could probably claim half of a quarter of it..., `
`......but that probably wouldn't be resolved until the distribution of the inheritance is settled. `
`...That's a problem.`
` To me, to Rudolf too!`
` And of course Rosa too, right?"`
`"......For all of our various situations, we need to gather money urgently.`
` ...It's our biggest weak point. `
`Then, ......what are they after?`
` Kyrie, ...can you tell?"`
`".....................`
`......It's the first I've heard of it, but one of the premises here is that we have an urgent need to collect money, right?"`
`".....................nn, ......"`
`"......Kyrie-san.`
` When you're on the offensive in a man's business, that's the time you need funding.`
` Please understand that."`
`".........Wha-t's this, Rudolf?`
` You didn't tell Kyrie-san about it?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` I wasn't really hiding it.`
` ......Actually, it was kinda..."`
`"It's alright.`
` If this is something that you decided wasn't necessary to tell me about,`
` I won't press you about it right here. `
`......What's more important is finding out what the Golden Witch is after, right?"`
`"Yes...`
`.........By organizing what we know, will we be able to see the enemy's move coming?"`
`Rudolf had a certain measure of trust in Kyrie's unique thinking technique, 'chessboard thinking'.`
` Of course, it didn't give him any more peace of mind than fortune telling, `
`but every time Rudolf was polishing up some important strategy, he would give a great deal of thought to Kyrie's advice...`
` For a while, Kyrie pressed her finger against her forehead, considering...`
`".........Judging by the fact that her coming here was kept hidden until today, `
`one of her goals is some kind of surprise that she wants to give us. `
`.........We can't know whether that has something to do with assets or being recognized as a relative."`
`"However, because it was kept hidden that she could come until today,`
` maybe you could say that she didn't want us to be notified in advance and therefore interact with her.`
` Which means that, it seems her goal is one that would be disadvantageous to her if we did interact.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"I get it...`
` For example, if it was something like a will which Father had written previously, or something that could prove that she was acknowledged as a blood relative,`
` if we assume it was something like that, ......it would be completely unshakable.`
` If she thought it was rock-solid proof, then you'd think she'd actually have announced it beforehand."`
`"...That's right.`
` Since we are in a position to doubt her, she should have brought a lawyer or an expert,`
` and thrust some completely undeniable proof before us.`
` If she could."`
`"Hmmmm.`
` ...So that would mean that, from the time she first aimed for a surprise attack, we know the enemy couldn't win in an honest, frontal attack. `
`No wonder.`
` If a trump card can win no matter what, it's best to play it out in the open.`
` If you play it in a roundabout way, it might actually obscure the impact of that trump card."`
`"......To skip to the conclusion, `
`...you would probably expect that that some huge surprise would be thrust in front of you, `
`something related either directly or indirectly to the inheritance problem that everyone is so infatuated with.`
` ...The other party probably plans to have the impact of this alone be enough to overpower us. `
`......However, even if this carries with it a significant impact, it is not absolute."`
`"In other words, ......we have enough leeway to take advantage of this."`
`"You've really got brains!`
` Even understandin' just this much is really reassurin'! `
`In other words, you're tellin' us not to get sucked into our opponents pace."`
`"...In the end, it's an extremely simple conclusion.`
` No matter what our opponent brings up, we interact calmly, without rushing things. `
`......This is just the very first step in the art of negotiation.`
` You really can't say that you've predicted your opponent's thoughts with just this."`
`"Come on.`
` ...Just like usual, that was pretty good.`
` .........Now that we know that we have a little leeway to attack, it gives us a little more room to spare."`
`"What we don't know is how she is connected to Krauss nii-san.`
` ......Is it a surprise for Krauss nii-san too, or was the person who called her here none other than Krauss nii-san himself? `
`......If it's the latter, it might make things very troublesome."`
`"............That's right.`
` ...Secretly calling a mystery woman on the day of the family conference.`
` ...Repulsive, but it somehow feels like Nii-san."`
`"Aneki, let's do this.`
` ...As long as she can't clearly prove her identity, we won't accept her position in any way."`
`"That would be best.`
` ......She really didn't even name herself to Kyrie-san.`
` ...We can't let our conference be disturbed by the statement of some unknown woman."`
`"......She might even show us proof that she's a blood relative.`
` If she can show that Father's blood runs through her veins, like with a maternity record document, there's nothing we can do."`
`"We can suspect that any proof is only something disguised.`
` Even if it is the real thing, in order to prove that the person mentioned is the person in question, we would need to check their condition at a hospital. `
`...At the very least, it will be impossible to prove that now, on Rokkenjima."`
`"......You're right.`
` So, in other words, it's something like this.`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth. `
`So we can't believe anything until the typhoon passes and they prove it to us at the proper place.`
` ...*giggle*."`
`"Recklessly finding fault in that kind of thing is Aneki's specialty.`
` We'll be counting on you."`
`"Are you an idiot?`
` You'll be helping too.`
` ......We need money.`
` And quickly, and a large sum!`
` We're all in this together. `
`.........As if we could just stand by and let a mystery woman, who appeared unexpectedly in a place like this, destroy our goal, the inheritance...!"`
`Rudolf and Eva always grew united as siblings in times like these,`
` sickened by the idea that their own inheritance might be snatched away by an outsider.`
` Kyrie noticed how indomitable they looked, swung her head slightly to the side, and gave a small sigh as she looked out the window.`
` Outside, there was still a strong rain falling, and everything was gray, having lost all vibrance.`
` It felt like the lush garden that the sun had shone on earlier had been no more than a lie.`
` For some reason, the words Eva had said just a short while ago kept repeating in Kyrie's head.`
` So, in other words, it's something like this.`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth.`
` There was an odd nuance to those words.`
` Right now, this island was closed off by the typhoon and isolated.`
` They had no official connections and no hospital.`
` So on this island, no matter what manner of proof with any relation to the outside world was shown, one could claim that it was fiction.`
` It was impossible to prove that something was the truth.`
` They were cut off from the outside world, and any truth that must be proven in the outside world would be called 'fiction'...`
` So did that mean, `
`......that now, on this Rokkenjima, there was nothing that was truthful?`
`......That everything would be controlled by 'fiction'? `
`It almost gave the illusion,`
` ......that separate from the human world made from truth, `
`...was another world called fiction, in which they had been shut away.`
`......Kyrie remembered what that woman had looked like one more time.`
` And she remembered the woman's figure, and the witch of the portrait.`
` On this island, which had been isolated from the world of humans, and shut away in the world of nonhumans, ......a nonhuman being had visited.`
` No matter what she did, Kyrie couldn't help think of that smile that had appeared on that woman's face as anything other than a thing of misfortune......`
` It feels like my chessboard thinking mistook a vital premise, `
`...now that I try to understand that smile of misfortune.`
`...That's right, `
`that smile seemed like that of something not human looking down on me.`
` I have reasoned based on the assumption that my opponent was a 'human' like us.`
`......However,`
` just like this island now, she may be a being that is not human, and human values may not matter for her.`
` In that case...`
`......all reasoning is useless.`
` For what reason has the witch been invited here today?`
`.........Only one thing is certain.`
` ...Now, in this instant, she is staying somewhere in this vast mansion...`
`"......Maria.`
` ......Around lunchtime today, we, .........met her outside, right?`
` A woman.`
` Who was......, she?"`
`"...Uu-.`
` Said it many times.`
` ...Beatrice."`
`"Maria, did you ever meet Beatrice before that...?"`
`"Uu-. `
`Met her every year."`
`"Every year...?`
` In this mansion on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Uu-."`
`"...I don't know what uu- means!`
` Is that true?!"`
`"......Yes."`
`"How long have you been meeting her?`
` How many years ago did it start?!"`
`"...Uu-.`
` ......Don't know."`
`"You don't know?!`
` Why?!`
` Last year?`
` Two years ago?!"`
`"......Since before that.`
` ......Uu-."`
`Rosa was astonished.`
`...Only the Ushiromiya family mansion existed on this island.`
` So there was no way that there were any humans other than themselves on this island.`
` And yet, Maria said that she had been meeting with that suspicious woman every year during the family conference......`
` If what Maria said was the truth, `
`......then that strange woman called Beatrice had been at the family conference every year.`
`......That's insane.`
` Is she saying that some eerie woman was at the family conference every year, and none of us ever noticed it...?! `
`Even though Rosa had just met her herself a couple of hours ago in the rose garden,`
` she was overcome with a strange emotion which told her not to accept that existence...`
`'What' in the world did I meet with earlier today in the rose garden, as the typhoon grew close and the winds blew strong......`
`"......Maria.`
` So, you said that you met her every year.`
` ...After you met, what did you do?"`
`"Uu-.`
` Sang songs, learned magic.`
` Learned how to write magic circles."`
`"R, ...really?`
` That's incredible. `
`......Maria, you often draw scribbles..., `
`...no, magic circles, in your notebook, right?`
` Did she teach you that?"`
`"Uu-!`
` You know what, Beatrice drew a model!`
` C'mon, c'mon, look! Look!"`
`Maria joyfully fished around in her handbag.`
`......Then, she drew out a single notebook and began opening to that page.`
` Most of the pages were covered with drawings that were literally scribbles.`
` All of them were occult-like things, and, `
`while it might sound rude to Maria, who was joyfully flipping through the pages, they were all creepy.`
`"Look! Here!`
` Beatrice wrote it!!`
` Uu-!!"`
`On each page Maria opened to, there was another eerie magic circle that had been drawn.`
`......Furthermore, at a glance, Rosa realized that Maria hadn't drawn them.`
` The strength of the strokes, the thickness of the lines, how clean the shape was.`
`......This by itself wasn't enough to guess the background of the person who had written it,`
` but it was enough for Rosa to understand that it was definitely someone older than Maria.`
` Rosa had to accept it now.`
`...There really was a person on this Rokkenjima that she herself hadn't known existed until now,`
` and this person had come to the family conference every year to play with Maria.`
`".........Maria.`
` Umm, does this witch Beatrice live here...?`
` Or does she live outside the island like us...?"`
`"Uu-.`
` ......Beatrice is the witch of Rokkenjima, so she lives on this island."`
`".........So, you're saying that she's on the island even when it isn't the family conference, ...right......?"`
`"Uu-."`
`"I don't know what uu- means!!`
` What do you mean?!"`
`"...!`
` ............Yes.`
` ...Uu-."`
`Wh, ......what in the, what in the.........`
` I can't believe it, I can't believe it...! `
`How long has this unknown witch been living on this island?! `
`I used to live on this island.`
` I lived on this island, passing the time in the mansion, in the rose garden.`
` And even so, I never encountered a witch like that, `
`......never, `
`......supposedly................`
`"Mama......?`
` Mama......?`
` What's wrong......?`
` Mama...?!"`
`"......My head, .........hurts..."`
`...I was probably getting a little mixed up with my memories from when I was a young girl.`
` When I was a young girl, unlike Maria, I was very frightened of the witch.`
` So for me, the name Beatrice was a synonym for something frightening.`
`......So surely, my feeling of fear from my days as a young girl has been revived because a woman calling herself that has appeared...`
`......She couldn't be a witch.`
`......She's obviously a 'human' calling herself Beatrice, right? `
`That's right...`
`......That witch entrusted me with an envelope...`
` What in the world could that be? `
`Rosa pulled that western-style envelope out of her pocket.`
`...It was the western-style envelope which bore the Ushiromiya family crest, which Kinzo used on his personal letters.`
`......And it had even been sealed with the red sealing wax by the Head's Ring, which Kinzo held.`
`.........Which meant, ...this envelope belonged to the Ushiromiya head.`
`...In other words, it was from Father.`
` Why was a woman calling herself Beatrice holding it, and why did she give it to me? `
`That's right, `
`I'm sure she said to read this aloud at dinner.`
`.........What in the world could be written inside...? `
`An uncertainty gripped Rosa,`
` as if opening this envelope would release a ridiculous object of misfortune...`
`......However, at the same time, a little curiosity sprouted up, causing her to want to find out what was written inside before the other siblings.`
` Using common sense, .........one could guess that a huge resolution somehow related to Father's inheritance was probably written inside.`
` Actually, ...since she had been made to hold it by a woman who called herself Beatrice, there was no way that wasn't related.`
`......Did it mean that this person wants, not just the four, but a total of five people to be included in the inheritance?`
`...............I needed a large sum of money, ...and I couldn't wait long.`
` I felt like a sinful daughter for discussing the distribution of Father's inheritance while he was still alive.`
`......However, this was no time to keep everything pretty.`
`...And I was even consulting with Rudolf nii-san and Eva nee-san in order to get some money out of Krauss nii-san.`
` With myself in this situation, I can't help but foresee misfortune...`
`.........What could be written in here?`
` ......I'm sure there must be something frightening written.`
`.........Shall I first read it secretly myself? `
`The witch had requested it be done at the dinner table, when everyone was gathered.`
`......However, didn't that just mean that she could have read it aloud herself at the dinner table? `
`Why did she go to all the trouble of entrusting it to me?`
`.........In other words, was that because it didn't matter whether I secretly read it beforehand...?`
`......It would be better to secretly read the contents first.`
`...I understand that it would be breaking my promise.`
`......But this is no longer the time to keep things pretty...`
` It would probably be good to discuss it with Eva nee-san and Rudolf nii-san, ...depending on the contents.`
`...Nee-san and the rest are always really good thinkers when it comes to this kind of thing......`
` When I gulped, ......and put my hand to the red sealing wax...`
`...Something suddenly pulled on my sleeve, and I let out a small scream.`
`".........Wh, what?! `
`M, .........Maria.`
` Don't scare me like that.`
` What?"`
`"...Uu-.........`
`............Can't."`
`"Huh......?"`
`The same sign of misfortune as the witch appeared in Maria's expression, sending a tingle up Rosa's spine...`
`"......Beatrice told Mama to read that letter during dinner.`
` ......You can't break a promise with a witch.`
` .........Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th, ...that's not it.`
` I just wanted to look at the envelope for a second.`
` ......I'll keep my promise.`
` ......After all, Mama always tells Maria to keep her promises.`
` ...Of course Mama will keep her promise..."`
`"Yes.`
` Mama's a good girl.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th, `
`......that laugh.`
` ......It isn't cute, so stop it."`
`".........Uu-."`
`"Come to think of it, you received a letter too, Maria.`
` .........What was written inside?"`
`"It isn't open.`
` ...Beatrice said mustn't open it until the time to open it comes.`
` So taking good care of it.`
` ...Uu-."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` ...You listen well to what Beatrice says, don't you, Maria."`
`"Uu-.`
` Maria is Beatrice's disciple, so she listens well to what her teacher says."`
`"......I, .........I see."`
` `
`Rosa realized something.`
`......Mixed in with Maria's gaze, ...was the light of a person other than Maria.`
`...If she broke the rules, and opened the envelope here, Beatrice would probably know about it.`
`......Because Maria was the witch's disciple.`
`.........Maria communicated with that witch......`
`"...Mama will keep her promise.`
` So tell Beatrice not to worry, okay?"`
`"Uu-!`
` Tell her."`
`"...Hey, Maria.`
` ...I want to speak with Beatrice, but what could I do to meet her, I wonder...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......Beatrice is very fickle, so she always shows herself suddenly.`
` Maria doesn't know a way to get her to meet Maria. `
`......But you know, she's always watching Maria.`
` So when Maria gets in trouble, she'll definitely save her afterwards.`
` ...She has definitely, erased her form, and is hiding close to Maria.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"D, ......don't I always tell you to stop that laughing!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria on the head.`
`......That put a stop to Maria's laughing voice, ...but it wasn't able to erase the color of misfortune that had risen to those eyes.`
` Rosa swore.`
`...She swore that, at least until they left this island, she must not leave Maria alone.`
`.........She couldn't allow an unknown being to make direct contact with her daughter any more......`
