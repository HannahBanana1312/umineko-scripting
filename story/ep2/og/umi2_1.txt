`My mind wandered.`
` Back to the days when I could barely imagine the happiness I have today.`
` I was a middle schooler at the time.`
` A normal girl, who imagined about love, as is normal at that age.`
` But I really should not have seen that dream.`
`...Because I am furniture.`
` Furniture is nothing more than a tool, and is not human.`
` To a person less than human such as myself, just receiving my education was more than enough to make me happy.`
` So even thinking about love was more than I deserved...`
` The Ushiromiya family family conference was a customary event held every October, `
`but relatives sometimes visited at other times.`
`...Of course, they didn't come just to drink tea.`
` On this day, Eva's family had visited the head family on Rokkenjima.`
` The three people from Krauss's family and the three people from Eva's family had gathered in the parlor,`
` and were having a friendly chat as they reported the news.`
` Genji had supposedly told Kinzo of Eva's family's arrival, but he hadn't come down yet.`
`...He was probably immersed in his own 'research', and couldn't spare the time.`
` This often happened, so the others waited patiently for their fickle father to come down.`
`"Hoh.`
` Isn't that reliable.`
` Do your best to study a lot from your father, and quickly become able to help him."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` I have been able to gain truly precious study from several of Father's elders who he has introduced me to.`
` Everything I learned was something that couldn't be learned in school."`
`"You learn math and language in school, right?`
` What you really need to learn is the right attitude for learning more.`
` Once you form that basis, you can finally start a long period of study that'll last your entire life."`
`"People who don't get this and don't spend their whole lives learning are fools.`
` They might get full marks in math and language, but they'll be useless for their company!"`
`"Hmm, that is exactly right.`
` Hideyoshi-san, your education policy is always truly excellent."`
`"George isn't quite a full man yet!`
` He should always keep that in mind, and embrace his studies."`
`"Stop it, dear.`
` George is a-lways giving it his all.`
` Right?"`
`"Truly excellent.`
` I wish our Jessica would learn from him..."`
`"...Sheesh.`
` Are you still holding a grudge about that test score?`
` I'm studying for tests as best I can.`
` At least don't say it here.`
` Pissing me off."`
`When praising George for his diligence, the conversation sometimes turned to Jessica, who hated studying.`
` Jessica made an openly displeased face, as though she'd known it would come to this.`
`"My, my...`
` Doesn't it seem as though, in addition to study, Jessica should also learn how to speak a little more lady-like?`
` That is shameful for a daughter who bears the Ushiromiya family crest."`
`"My, isn't that fascinating, right?`
` Times change.`
` The time when we had to dress modestly to entertain men ended a long time ago."`
`"That's right, that's right!`
` I knew you'd understand, Eva oba-sa-n!`
` Eheheheh!"`
`"......Haah...`
` My headache is truly trying today."`
`"Are you alright?`
` Natsuhi oba-san, your face looks off-color."`
`"Thank you, I am alright. `
`......But time really has flown.`
` It feels like just yesterday when you would run around half-naked by the beach and come back soaked."`
`"Wasn't Jessica-chan the same?`
` And now she's a lady who fusses over how to put on makeup.`
` You really are particular about your eyebrows. You look really cute today."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Nobody noticed, so I was a little worried."`
`A full smile rose to Jessica's face as the results of her own 'studies' were finally noticed.`
` Eva smiled back in the same way.`
` ...Then, she turned that smile towards Natsuhi.`
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee-san?`
` You must take notice of small changes in your own child.`
` Poor Jessica-chan.`
` Even though she probably wanted to first be noticed by her mother, right?"`
`"No problem, no problem.`
` That person never notices anything."`
`"Jessica.`
` I cannot admire you calling your mother 'that person'.`
` Apologize."`
`"......Later, I will speak to you at length about your language."`
`"Che...`
` If kids are a burden, just say so.`
` I'll get out of the way.`
` It's getting stuffy in here."`
`"Jessica...!"`
`Jessica was still at the age where she was a novice at studying for tests.`
` Recently, she had clashed often with her mother, who was enthusiastic about her education.`
`"Excuse me... `
`Kya?!"`
`Jessica, who was trying to leave the parlor in a bad mood, and Shannon, who was pushing a serving cart filled with tea, bumped into each other.`
`"Ah, Shannon. No need to worry about my tea.`
` I'm just going to wander around the garden."`
`"...M, Milady..."`
`"Shannon, the tea is getting cold.`
` Serve it quickly."`
`"M, my apologies..."`
`Shannon hadn't actually done anything wrong,`
` but Natsuhi, who felt like some shame to herself had been shown, lashed out at her emotionally.`
`...This was something that often happened in the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it seemed that Shannon wasn't strong-willed enough to accept it that way.`
` She shrunk back, and prepared the black tea while cowering.`
` She had the unfortunate habit of making more mistakes when she cowered.`
` Her pitiful appearance dispersed the peaceful atmosphere that had been there until just a moment ago.`
` That wasn't really Shannon's fault, but she thought she might be the source, and felt a pressure on her chest.`
` Her shaking fingers made the utensils clang, and you couldn't have complemented it as graceful.`
` The more pitiful everyone thought that was, the greater the silence grew,`
` the more irritated Natsuhi looked, and the more Shannon cowered...`
` Shannon's thin neck felt like it was being suffocated and choked by the death god of tension.`
` At that time, George spoke pleasantly, blowing away the stiff atmosphere.`
`"That's a nice smell.`
` What kind of black tea is it?"`
`"Umm, `
`.........this is......"`
`"No, don't say it.`
` I'll guess.`
` It's a very distinctive smell, so I probably know it.`
` ......Is it, Earl Grey?"`
`"I, I think it probably is..."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` It probably is Earl Grey.`
` When you get back to the kitchen, check the can."`
`"Hoh.`
` George-kun, you know a lot about black tea, don't you?"`
`"A company president who looked after me was very knowledgeable about black tea.`
` While listening to his lectures, I was able to learn a little."`
`"Oh yeah, the president of Okonogi Foods.`
` That person's profound knowledge was his specialty!"`
`"The names of black tea often refer to the place they are made, right?`
` So is this something cultivated from a place called Earl Grey?"`
`"I have heard that long ago in England, there was a person called Earl Grey, and it was named after him. `
`Furthermore, this distinctive smell doesn't come from tea leaves, but from a fruit called a bergamot, which is a relative of the mandarin orange."`
`"Is that so?`
` I never knew that.`
` Knowing that, the black tea will taste even more delicious."`
`"Alcohol and cigarettes are the same.`
` Luxury items have a taste of romance.`
` Knowledge like this deepens the taste."`
`"It's the same as the advertising on medicine.`
` Natsuhi nee-san, you should try reading the explanation on your favorite headache medicine someday.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` That would be good.`
` Try it tonight."`
`"...Yes, I'll try it."`
`"Shannon-chan, try opening that pot.`
` You should find some dried bergamot mixed in with the tea leaves."`
`"Ah, ......yes.`
` It is in there.`
` Something like dried orange peel is mixed in."`
`"Yes.`
` That's probably bergamot.`
` The main ingredient in Earl Grey's scent.`
` The scent is vivid, so it gives the taste an intense impression, but it's a docile taste that's easy to drink.`
` If you make it with milk, the scent may become more mild and wonderful.`
` If there's anything left in the pot after you've poured for everyone, you really should try drinking it with milk."`
`"Ah, ...yes...`
` Thank you very much..."`
`George gave her a small wink.`
` Shannon finally realized that George had been doing her a favor by calming down the atmosphere in the room.`
` And he had been doing it for her sake as she had cowered.`
` The Ushiromiya family did not pamper their servants.`
` So if there was any awkwardness, they would be harshly punished.`
` So it didn't often happen that they were given a helping hand like this.`
` Thanks to George's concern, Shannon was somehow able to get a hold of herself and finish serving everything safely.`
` If she was calm when she worked, she could easily carry out her tasks elegantly and flawlessly.`
` When the black tea was laid out on the table and the elegant scent drifted around,`
` the room was completely back to how it had been, in a peaceful mood, as everyone praised George's knowledge.`
` Shannon wanted to thank him for saving her, but it didn't look like she would get the chance.`
` So she at least thanked him inside her heart, praying to God that George would hear it, and pushed the serving cart away.`
`"George nii-san has always lent a helping hand in times like that.`
` By changing the topic or something."`
`Shannon and Jessica could be seen in the rose garden.`
` Jessica, who had gotten into a fight with her mother, still hadn't returned to the parlor, and was nonchalantly killing time like this.`
`"......When I think back on it, I feel that maybe this wasn't the first time he has helped me like that."`
`Whenever I made a careless mistake, and George was there,`
` he would always naturally smooth things over and make things harmonious, I think.`
`...Maybe it wasn't something as direct as picking up a fork that had been dropped.`
` But that was his way of caring.`
` Even servants have pride.`
` They want to fix their own mistakes by themselves.`
`...Because if a guest helped them out with that, they would lose face.`
`"He's really good at reading between the lines in those kinds of situations.`
` Well, maybe that's George nii-san's aesthetic take on things.`
` That guy's more of a show off than he looks.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"Th, that's not true...`
`...I think he is a really wonderful person."`
`"Hmmmm...?!`
` ......Shannon, you haven't fallen in love with George nii-san, have you?"`
`Shannon had uncharacteristically refuted Jessica's words forcefully, so Jessica had struck back.`
`"No, ...that's not it, I think......"`
`"Come to think of it, I almost never hear anything bad about George nii-san.`
` Huh?`
` I think I remember hearing him say that family-oriented girls were his type, didn't I? `
`Nice, that fits you perfectly, Shannon!"`
`"I, i, it does...?! `
`How could, `
`...I am not, umm, `
`...qualified, like that..."`
`"You sure are qualified!`
` You've known his face since long ago so you're almost a childhood friend.`
` They say that in a natural relationship where you don't realize you're a boy and girl, once you do realize it, things go on without a hitch, right?`
` No doubt!"`
`Jessica loved teen magazines with this kind of story, and she was always getting excited talking about that kind of thing with her friends.`
` So she was very sensitive to these kinds of love stories.`
` So this wasn't the first time Shannon had been exposed to this kind of story.`
` But this was certainly the first time she had noticed George as a member of the opposite sex.`
` She was furniture, and George was an honored guest connected to the Ushiromiya family.`
`......She had thought that she wouldn't be allowed to even imagine any deeper relationship.`
` So she hadn't thought of it.`
` Jessica poked fun at it, even more happy that it was someone else's problem.`
` Shannon was doing her best to make sure that her blushing cheeks weren't discovered.`
` So if George had shown up at a time like that, there'd be no way that she would be able to keep her cool.`
` They saw George come out from the entrance hall of the mansion.`
` It looked like he had seen them as well.`
` He headed over, waving his hand.`
` Shannon had to frantically try and regain her ordinary composure before George reached them...`
`"Grandfather finally came down.`
` Now they're having an adult discussion, so they chased me out."`
`"Hahaha, escaping then was the right choice.`
` It'd be better to get kissed by the angel of death than to look at Grandfather's face."`
`"You shouldn't speak that way.`
` ...However, I think Grandfather may think of us as the angel of death.`
` Anyway, when they started talking about borrowing money for business, I came over here."`
`That's right, this wasn't the customary annual October family conference.`
` Eva's family had visited to apply for a business loan from the head family.`
` Kinzo had vast resources, and he lent those out to his children.`
` Of course, they did not borrow money because they were living in poverty.`
`...What kind of business would they expand, using the vast amount of money that they borrowed? `
`How much interest would be attached, and how long would they have to repay it? `
`This wasn't a loan for those who didn't keep it.`
` It was a loan for those who were on the offense.`
` Kinzo strictly judged whether it was worth lending out his fortune, and afterwards, he strictly oversaw its use.`
` So this spectacle where relatives visited Rokkenjima and explained their business to Kinzo sometimes occurred.`
` To the parents, it might be a situation where they were forced by nervousness to move a lot of money.`
` But to Jessica, who lived on this isolated island called Rokkenjima, it was a precious opportunity to meet up with her cousins.`
` So being able to talk with the occasional guest such as George like this,`
` immediately cured her bad mood from getting into a fight with her mother a short while ago.`
`"My family's also completely stingy.`
` Even though there's probably some money left over, and they could lend it out graciously.`
` My dad and Grandfather will probably pigheadedly act so important."`
`"It's natural to be prudent when lending money.`
` Of course, my father will use what he borrows to expand his business, and he came with a plan that could be refused.`
` Everything else is left up to the presentation. `
`......But I really wish I could watch from the corner and learn.`
` Mother chased me out.`
` I'm a little let down."`
`"......It seems that the Master still scolds Krauss-sama and Eva-sama as though they haven't changed since they were kids.`
` I'm sure she didn't want to show that to her son, George-sama."`
`As Shannon hung her head, she thought back on a scene familiar to those who worked in the mansion.`
` Even Krauss, who acted haughtily towards his siblings, was still treated like a child by Kinzo.`
`...Shannon herself had often seen Kinzo slap Krauss and tell him to sit up straight.`
`......It was probably very embarrassing to be coerced like that at his age.`
` In the Ushiromiya family, taking care not to be in the same place when this happened was one of the great tasks of the servants.`
`...However, that meant that every time Shannon was in the same place, it was a mistake.`
`"Probably.`
` ...Realizing that and going away may be a child's duty. `
`......We-ll!`
` Even so, the flowers in this garden are truly splendid this year."`
`George stretched as he said that.`
`...And he smoothly changed the subject away from something that was a little gloomy.`
` This time, Shannon noticed it too.`
`......This person, George, could sensitively figure out the situation, and always changed the subject to something harmonious, out of concern.`
` It had been so smooth that Shannon hadn't noticed it until today.`
` Today, Shannon had to really admire that behavior of George's.`
` Almost all of the boys Shannon knew of her own age had been classmates during her education.`
` But they were all young, ......and none of them had had the composure that George did.`
` Even though he had been just another guest until a while ago,`
` ...today, she couldn't describe him with just that.`
` But that was idle thinking compared to her work as a servant.`
` Shannon tried to chase that away with a small shake of her head.`
`"Hm?`
` What's up?"`
`"Ah, no, it's nothing...! `
`Umm, shall I prepare some tea?`
` Umm, ......I will prepare some more of that Earl Grey."`
`"Ahaha, so you've remembered the name of that black tea.`
` I'm happy."`
`"Um, .........umm........."`
`"Hm?"`
`"...Umm, ......thank you for your concern back then..."`
`Shannon was finally able to put her thanks into words.`
` If you wrote it out, it wouldn't be very long,`
` ...but Shannon had needed just a little courage to say that out loud.`
` But George played dumb.`
`"What's this?`
` I don't remember doing anything I should be thanked for?`
` Heheh."`
`It seemed he was being a gentleman in his own way, saying that he hadn't helped her because he wanted to be thanked.`
` It seemed that George's response had been more or less predictable to Jessica.`
` Without thinking, she burst out laughing.`
`"See-?`
` This is it, isn't he a show-off?"`
`"N, no...`
` That isn't......"`
`Jessica made fun of Shannon as she remained silent, red-faced.`
` George didn't know the details, but he naturally joined in, laughing the same way.`
` The three of them lazily walked around the garden, talking about what was new.`
` George, as the oldest cousin, talked about his life experiences.`
` Jessica talked about recent life on Rokkenjima.`
` And Shannon talked about her recent work.`
` They kept going on about these trivial things.`
` Shannon, even if she found the others' stories deeply interesting,`
` didn't feel particularly connected to their contents.`
` She was nothing more than a servant, and she had no intention of delving into her master's lives.`
` She wanted them to enjoy their time speaking with her,`
` and was only pretending to listen intently and nod at the right moments.`
` But for some reason, she found talking with George deeply interesting today.`
` Even for things that she would normally ignore, she felt like she could feel a kindness hidden beneath the words.`
` For some reason, she wanted to know more things about George, no matter how trivial.`
` So..., she stared fixedly at him.`
` She thought that as far as looks went, this person Ushiromiya George, ......was probably, `
`about average, and he didn't really stick out.`
` But he was diligent, serious, ...and had a deep prudence which allowed him to understand people's hearts and show concern.`
` But she had never been aware of these things until now.`
` She might not have met him many times, but she had known his face for many years.`
` Even so, she had not noticed once until now.`
`...So Shannon was embarrassed that she hadn't been able to notice, and she blushed.`
` Maybe George thought that Shannon was listening to his stories intently, because he kept on talking about himself.`
`...But Jessica didn't miss that slight change in Shannon.`
` So she turned the discussion around to the topic Shannon wanted to hear about most.`
`"......Oh yeah, come to think of it,`
` George nii-san, did you finally get a girlfriend?"`
`"Wh, what is this, out of the blue..."`
`Normally, just George's reaction would have been answer enough.`
` But for some reason, as she was now, Shannon wouldn't be able to understand it unless he said it clearly.`
`"Um, ...umm...`
` George-sama is very nice, `
`......so I'm sure, `
`...umm, ......he's very popular......"`
`"No, err, ...hahahahahahahahahaha."`
`"Quit it Shanno~n.`
` Isn't cornering him like that actually pretty me-an?`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I, I wasn't trying to be mean........."`
`"Thank you for your happy wrong impression.`
` It's a shame, but I still don't have a relationship with any special girl.`
` As you see, my looks are below average.`
` And I can't speak tactfully in a way that can entertain a girl."`
`"I, I don't think that's true.`
` ......And, I think that a man's charm is decided by something that can't be measured by his appearance. `
`Th, that's why, umm,`
` ......I think that you might be a, um, ...very charming man, George-sama..."`
`Shannon was uncharacteristically verbose.`
` Compared to how she normally was, this was very verbose.`
` George looked fairly pleased about hearing his own charm described, but he was just a little surprised at this high praise.`
` Jessica, sure now that her own imagination was right on, acted as though she could barely hold back her laughter.`
`"Thank you, Shannon-chan.`
` I hope I can quickly run into a girl gracious enough to feel my charm."`
`"Yes, I'm sure you'll run into one.`
` ......I'm sure there's at least one, `
`......no, a l, lot of girls that will recognize your real charm."`
`Maybe she wanted to say that there was one really close.`
`...Shannon avoided saying that much, drawing a final line as a servant.`
`"R, ......really.`
` ...I guess I'm kind of, embarrassed..."`
`Maybe he had never been praised this much by a girl.`
` George's face turned just as bright red as Shannon's.`
` As she watched the two of them, Jessica giggled sadistically.`
`"Well, I'm sure you'll eventually find a wonderful partner, George nii-san.`
` But I don't think you'll be able to escort your partner as you are now, ri-ght?`
` It looks like you're diligent, but it seems that you've been completely abandoning your study of 'that'."`
`"...S, sorry about that.`
` I'll start studying that bit by bit."`
`"How would you do that by yourself?`
` Are you gonna watch movies about love?`
` Or are you gonna learn from Hideyoshi oji-san?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Che...`
` Acting so triumphant.`
` Men aren't a match for girls when it comes to that."`
`Normally, when George and Jessica got together, their parents would say 'George is diligent and admirable', and 'Jessica is lazy and rude'.`
` So it was probably unbearable fun for Jessica when their roles were finally reversed.`
` George also realized that, so this time, he was content with being the one who was teased.`
`"Then George nii-san, as long as you're okay with it, why not practice a bit with Shannon?`
` You'll keep Shannon entertained all day long on a date!`
` What do you think?!"`
`"Wh, wh, what are you...!`
` M, Milady...!"`
`When she heard Jessica's audacious plan, Shannon's face turned bright red with a 'poof', and a doughnut of smoke started to rise around it.`
`"Th, that's a very fascinating plan, but, ...I'd feel bad for Shannon-chan.`
` Wouldn't this just waste your precious day off?`
` I'd be butting in on the ideal moment when you'll be able to be alone with someone you really have feelings for.`
` I couldn't do something so boorish."`
`"I, I, ...I also, umm......, `
`......don't have a person I have feelings for or anything, so, umm, `
`...caring for me like that is, yes, i, it's unnecessary...!"`
`Shannon's blood had all rushed to her head, and it looked like even she didn't know what she was babbling about.`
` It seemed that Jessica, who knew how Shannon normally was, found that really comical.`
` She couldn't hide her cackling laugh anymore.`
`"...I, is that true...?`
` I can't believe that a cute girl like you would be single, Shannon-chan..."`
`"I, I, I, `
`...am a servant so, umm, `
`......I don't have any relationship with a boy, umm..."`
`"Which means that, in the future, if Shannon's gonna have any chance of getting herself a wonderful guy,`
` she needs practice with relationships, right?`
` So you each want the same thing.`
` Alright, that'll work nice, *cackle*!"`
`Jessica irresponsibly cheered the two of them on.`
` Now, George was also hanging his head, red-faced.`
`"George, I've been calling for you.`
` Can't you hear me?"`
`Since Eva appeared in what was already an embarrassing situation, both of them were even more flustered.`
` Jessica watched and laughed loudly.`
`"Ah, M, M, Mother...!`
` Sorry, our conversation got complicated.`
` I didn't notice...!"`
`"Oh, Eva-sama..., my deepest apologies..."`
`"It looks like you young kids are getting really excited.`
` You're all about that age.`
` I know it's hard to stop talking about things like that.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Come o-n, aren't you still really young, Eva oba-san?`
` Please tell us how you and Hideyoshi oji-san me-t."`
`"Oh my, there's no way I could say that.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` Because you're all so young.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"S, so, what is it, Mother?`
` You called because you wanted something, right?"`
`"Your father and the rest have finished talking.`
` We're going to talk to Grandfather about you, so come on."`
`"About me?`
` What could that be?"`
`"The same topic everyone was just having.`
` Remember, that topic?"`
`"O, ...oh, that topic.`
` That isn't really something we need to talk to Grandfather about, right...?"`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Wait, George nii-san, you aren't getting married to someone?!"`
`"C, ...congratulations...!"`
`"No, no...!`
` Didn't I just say I didn't have a special woman?"`
`"That isn't something to brag about, is it?`
` ...Seriously."`
`Eva smiled bitterly, looking a little shocked.`
`"...Ah, ...I got it!`
` George nii-san, it's one of those, right? A marriage meeting!"`
`"A marriage meeting..., you say?"`
`"......Nn, ......well, yeah.`
` ......Hahahaha..."`
`Surely, as a man, George wanted to find a partner by himself and take her back with him.`
` So it seemed that he thought it would be a bit shameless to meet his partner for the first time in a marriage meeting arranged by his parents.`
`"Shouldn't marriage meetings be done at a more mature age...?!`
` I still don't feel like I've become an adult..."`
`"Of course, we have no desire to rush into an immediate engagement or marriage, right?`
` It isn't a problem if you deepen your friendship, and then when you settle down as you age, have her moved to our family register."`
`From Eva's forceful appearance, and George's somewhat lazy one, the others could catch a glimpse of the scheme behind this marriage meeting.`
` They didn't know who this other person was, but it was surely someone profitable to Eva's family in a business sense.`
` This whole thing about having them have an engagement relationship until they changed registers to deepen the connection between the two families felt almost like a political strategy.`
`"Marriage isn't something you do after you start liking someone.`
` You fall in love after you do it, right?`
` If you marry just based on emotions, you'll definitely regret it.`
` There's definitely nothing wrong with choosing a person with a secure background for your partner in life, and then building up emotions of love."`
`"Eva oba-san, isn't that rude to Hideyoshi oji-san?`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I love that person.`
` I want to always be with him, and to live my life by his side."`
`"......Eva-sama, that's wonderful.`
` Truly splendid..."`
`"Thank you.`
` But we built up those feelings while we were husband and wife, you see?`
` And I believe that in the future, we will be much, much closer than we are now.`
` I think that's a good way for a husband and wife to be."`
`"Although I don't think that means you can argue that it's alright to marry someone you don't even like."`
`"That doesn't mean you can argue that it's alright to marry someone you don't even like.`
` A wedding is instantaneous, `
`but your life as a married couple after that is very, very long. `
`So you should search with prudence, and not leave it up to momentary emotions.`
` Don't you think that your mother and the rest of us would be better at that than a person immature in life experience such as yourself?"`
`"......Th, that may be true, but..."`
`"I am proud of you, my only son.`
` I want to make you grow so that you will never be embarrassed no matter where you go.`
` ...And you are the only grandson to carry Father's blood.`
` ......We must prudently choose a fitting partner for you."`
`As everyone related to the Ushiromiya family knew, Eva adored George so much that he was the apple of her eye.`
` But that didn't mean she had pampered him.`
` She had been strict with him, and had grown him into a handsome man who wouldn't betray her expectations.`
` ...That's how he was the apple of her eye.`
`"Your partner definitely won't be selected based on your parents' profit and loss.`
` ......I will let you meet a suitable and truly wonderful woman.`
` Maybe there is some immature youth inside of you that's alienating you from this. `
`......But at least listen to what your mother says on this point.`
` Have I ever failed to think of your sake?"`
`"..................No, ......you haven't..."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` So, let's go.`
` We're keeping Father waiting.`
` Hurry to the mansion."`
`"Well, sorry, you two.`
` See you later."`
`George bowed to the two of them, ...and after bowing once more to Shannon, he dashed off to the mansion.`
`"Well, Oba-san will go too.`
` Sorry for interrupting your fun conversation, Jessica-san, Shannon-chan."`
`"N, no, no.`
` Please, don't worry about it.`
` Come on, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Y, yes...!"`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure you'll meet someone wonderful soon too, Jessica-chan.`
` A wonderful person suitable for you."`
`"So if he's at the same level as me, hahaha, you mean a guy with bad grades?`
` That kinda pisses me off, hahaha!"`
`"And of course, you too, Shannon-chan.`
` I'm sure that a wonderful man suitable for you will appear."`
`"Y, yes!!`
` Thank you very much..."`
`As Eva giggled and smiled, she approached Shannon's ear with a hand over her mouth, as though she was trying to tell her a secret.`
`".........Huh?"`
`"I'm sure you'll find a perfect match for a lowly servant like yourself.`
` ......Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education?`
` Know your place."`
`".........Th, ...that's not what..., ...I meant..."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future.`
` To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades. `
`Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant?"`
`Those malicious words all poured into Shannon's ear without spilling a drop...`
`......To Shannon, it was like cold water was being poured in there.`
`"..................I, I, `
`......didn't mean..."`
`This was all whispered in secret.`
` And with the same smile as before.`
`...Jessica, who could only see Eva's expression, didn't think it was anything other than Eva telling Shannon some embarrassing story about love.`
` When their secret conversation ended, Eva patted Shannon's shoulders, as though she was urging her on.`
`"Don't worry, `
`I'm sure that you'll find a 'perfect' match for a partner.`
` Right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...Alright, Jessica-chan.`
` See you later."`
`"Yes, see you later.`
` Then, please tell me about your story with Hideyoshi oji-sa~~n!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`Eva laughed dryly and headed back to the entrance hall.`
` Behind Jessica, who was cheerfully waving her hand,`
` ...Shannon reflected very, very deeply on those words of Eva's, about knowing her place...`
`...I am seriously reflecting on how I got into a bit of a good mood.`
` I had forgotten.`
` I am furniture.`
` Furniture isn't human.`
` So I am a being who must feel gratitude for even being treated like a human,`
` and I am not permitted to wish for anything more.`
` Even if people develop affection for furniture that they're used to using, `
`that is an emotion on the human's side, and the furniture's side has no right to hope for that.`
`......They should just serve with simple honesty every day.`
` But that feeling I felt when talking with George-sama and Jessica-sama, ...is a forbidden drug for me.`
` In other words, it may be an emotion I must not know.`
`"......Shannon.`
` You have been too careless for a while now.`
` Do you not feel well?"`
`"N, no.`
` My apologies..."`
`Natsuhi's words 'too careless' were right on the mark.`
` Even Shannon couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed Natsuhi until she had called.`
` This was a time when she normally had to concentrate on the cleaning.`
` But she had just kept sighing and hadn't accomplished anything...`
`"Even if there aren't any guests, you must always be alert.`
` Acting like this is shameful as a servant working for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...Yes.`
` I will take care, from now on..."`
`"The head and my husband will return very soon.`
` Has the study's cleaning been completed?`
` Has the staircase's cleaning been completed?"`
`"M, my apologies...`
` Not yet..."`
`"Yes, I know.`
` So I had Runon do it.`
` While you were plodding around, cleaning the hallway, she finished cleaning the study and the staircase."`
`"......That's because, umm, `
`......I wanted to clean it properly, so it took some time......"`
`Shannon was simple and honest, so she would always carry out her tasks seriously and properly, without any omissions.`
` So she was always slow with her work.`
` In contrast, Runon skillfully avoided important steps wherever she could.`
` So she could compete her jobs with a result looked similar to an outsider, but in a much shorter time.`
` In other words, she was good at cutting corners.`
` Compared to that, maybe we should say Shannon, who talked back at Natsuhi when Natsuhi was in a bad mood, was bad at cutting corners...`
` Of course, there was nothing that Natsuhi couldn't stand more than a servant talking back.`
` Her forehead creased, and she spoke sternly.`
` And yet, her slow, admonishing style of speech was even more terrifying, and finally made Shannon realize she had said the wrong thing...`
`"In that case, aim to do a thorough cleaning.`
` Shannon, I order you to clean the reception hall right now.`
` It is an important hall, where several pictures treasured by the head are displayed, and where honored guests of the Ushiromiya family are invited.`
` Clean it thoroughly, so that not a speck of dust remains, and so that even you are satisfied.`
` Of course, you will finish today.`
` Until you finish that and report it to me, you will not be permitted any food or rest.`
` Understood?"`
`"Y, .........yes, Madam."`
`"That is good.`
` Servants should endeavor to only use those words.`
` The next time you talk back, I will give you an even more severe punishment, so with that in mind,`
` engrave these words in your heart."`
`"Yes..., Madam.`
` ...Thank you for your guidance."`
`"You are welcome."`
`As Natsuhi acted like her headache was troubling her, she headed off down the corridor...`
` When she couldn't see her anymore, Shannon hung her head and sighed.`
`......She had been careless, so something like this had happened.`
` Even though I'm bad at everything I do, I should be able to at least carry out the cleaning as well as an average person can, right?`
` It's because I can't even perform that well, ...that I'm so shameful and crying.`
` What could be more shameful than this? `
`Not only have I been unable to perform a single bit of cleaning well,`
` but just now, when Natsuhi was scolding me...`
`......I was envisioning that person appearing and rescuing me.`
` If only George-sama were here.`
` Would he casually step in and save me? `
`I'm sure he would show up cheerfully, intentionally acting like he doesn't know what's going on, nimbly change the subject, and make me forget I was ever rebuked by Natsuhi...`
` I kept envisioning him,`
` suddenly appearing from the other side of the door,`
` or the other end of the hallway.`
` I envisioned the kind of person that would be an appropriate partner for him in a marriage meeting.`
` And I envisioned how unfitting I am for him.`
` Eva clearly told me that.`
` It has repeated endlessly through my dreams...`
`".........You're still as clumsy as always, Nee-san.`
` Milady has been in a bad mood since this morning.`
` That happened because you said too much when you should have hung your head in silence."`
`"......Kanon-kun..."`
`Kanon was suddenly there.`
`......His footsteps were quieter than a cat's, and he left no trace of his presence.`
` She probably wouldn't have noticed him no matter how long he stood there...`
` The expression on Kanon's face was...hatred.`
` He made that expression for Shannon, who didn't know how to do it herself...`
`"Madam and Runon can fall into hell.`
` That person knows where Madam checks, and only cleans those areas.`
` Her cleaning just now was like that.`
` I know because I saw.`
` .........She wasn't really cleaning.`
` ...She's just the worst kind of parasite, leeching off of your thorough cleaning."`
`"You mustn't use such dirty words...`
` Dirty words pollute your clean soul, Kanon-kun.`
` So at least don't use those words in front of me.`
` ......Alright?"`
`"............Hmph."`
`Kanon faced away, acting sulky.`
` It was a dishonest reaction, very like Kanon, ...but I was a little happy.`
` He was getting mad for my sake.`
`"......Cleaning the reception hall will be tough.`
` I'll help."`
`"Thank you.`
` But I was the one Madam ordered, so don't worry.`
` ......Don't you also have your own work, Kanon-kun?"`
`"............It's a filthy job.`
` My soul was corrupted long ago."`
`Kanon then hung his head, and bit his lower lip...`
`"Just saying that you'll help is enough for me.`
` ...If you don't go back to your own job, even you will receive punishment.`
` ...And that would make me sad."`
`Shannon knew Kanon's character well.`
` ...Sometimes, he didn't reflect on himself.`
` If I don't refuse forcefully, he will help me even if it means neglecting his own job...`
` Kanon was a little sad that his favor had been rejected,`
` but he realized that in the end, going too far would also cause her pain, and he gave a single, small sigh.`
`"............`
`...Understood.`
` ......Do your best, Nee-san."`
`"Yes.`
` .........And I am also partly to blame."`
`"You aren't at fault at all, Nee-san...!"`
`"...No.`
` I am.`
` ......So go now."`
`Kanon-kun's face showed that he still hadn't completely accepted it, but without being any more persistent, he disappeared.`
`......Even though Kanon-kun had given me words of comfort when I was down.`
` Even so, I was dejected again because it wasn't 'him'.`
` That in itself, was a sin.`
` That went far beyond any dream the likes of me could be permitted to see, I don't know my place.`
`...Shannon, who had neglected breakfast, already felt her thinking grow weaker.`
`......But if she didn't finish up cleaning the reception hall, she could not receive Natsuhi's permission to eat.`
` That cruel Natsuhi had surely told the kitchen something to that effect.`
`...I have to respectfully receive Madam's punishment.`
` That's right.`
` My position in the world is furniture, ...and I had been intoxicated by a dream that is beyond me...`
` I finished cleaning the hallway and I went to the reception hall.`
` Maybe my hunger made my nose more sensitive.`
` I could sense a delicious aroma wafting from the kitchen, which should have been far away, and my empty stomach was encouraged even more.`
`...Until I finished up here, I could not get any soup.`
` I just had to prepare myself.`
` Several portraits were hung in the reception hall.`
` One of those portraits, ...was thought to hold a special meaning amongst the servants.`
`......It was the portrait of the witch.`
` That wasn't its true name, but everyone in the mansion called it that.`
` The name of the woman with elegant blonde hair, drawn as the subject of that portrait, was Beatrice.`
`...It was whispered that she might be the family head, Kinzo's former mistress.`
`......And also that she was the great witch who had given Kinzo the gold of the legend.`
` The witch, Beatrice, master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
` She was gracious to those who respected her, but she would surely curse those that made light of her.`
` It was in Shannon's character not to neglect rules and beliefs such as those.`
`...So she thought of the portrait of her other master as that person herself, and always treated it carefully, treasuring it.`
`...And telling the witch that only existed inside the portrait the secrets of her heart had become part of her daily routine.`
`......She was furniture.`
` Furniture doesn't complain.`
` Cannot complain.`
` So she had no right to speak her mind about her difficult days.`
` She had no right to open her mouth and say those words.`
` So, ......she at least spoke her mind inside her heart.`
` She spoke her mind inside her heart, using words she couldn't say aloud, ...and protested to the formless witch.`
` Of course, the witch didn't answer.`
` She didn't console, and she didn't laugh it off.`
`......Shannon could only interpret that silence as she liked, as though the witch was responding agreeably.`
`...Beatrice-sama.`
`......Please listen to my worthless story.`
` As Shannon wiped the dust from the witch's portrait, she spoke that inside her heart.`
`.........I certainly am incompetent and uncultured, just as Eva-sama said.`
`......I am not a person.`
`...So maybe I have no right to love...`
`......But in that case, why was I given a heart which can know love?`
`...At that point, Shannon held back her tears for a time.`
` The sound of the rain, which had started falling, along with the chill air in the reception hall, made her feel as though her shabbiness had increased another level.`
`"Real furniture, ...doesn't have anything like a heart.`
` So they don't have to love people, right?`
` So they don't feel pain.`
` ......If I'm just another piece of furniture, ......why do I have a heart?`
` .........If it's going to be this painful and this harsh, ............I wish I hadn't been given something like a heart............!"`
`......I see.`
` A heart was given to furniture.`
` One can sometimes make something pleasant out of that...`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
`"eh.................."`
`The witch that didn't answer or laugh, `
`...answered, `
`and laughed.`
` Was it her imagination?`
` Was she hearing things?`
` No, that's wrong.`
`...After all, the next words became a 'voice', and I could hear them, not with my heart, but with my ears...`
`"Humans have continually searched for the elements that make up the world since before the modern era.`
` It is said that in the ancient times, Greeks tried explaining the world with the four elements of wind, fire, water, and earth.`
` And after that, over several millennia, humans added several elements to those four,`
` trying to explain the world with several interpretations such as the five elements, the six elements, the seven elements, the eight elements, and the twelve elements, `
`but they couldn't explain the one true 'single element'.`
`.........However, a single man appeared, guided by a star, and finally explained the single element that makes up the world.`
` Know what it is......?"`
`"...............eh, `
`.........ah, `
`.........wh, `
`............wh, who........."`
`Shannon fearfully turned around...`
` Right there, ......she 'existed'.`
` Not as an illusion, in reality.`
` The contrast made by the lightning made it clear that this was not just a daydream.`
`"......That is 'love'.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch of the portrait elegantly held a golden pipe to her mouth, and giggled.`
`...She laughed at the ignorance which causes humankind's thoughts to stray far from the most simple answer.`
`"That man explained everything in the world with love.`
` That is the single element.`
` That man fully explained how the world was constructed with the smallest number. `
`......How simple and clear, how splendid, exhilarating, pleasant and thrilling.`
` ...The year that man was finally born was called the start of the modern era.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Shannon lost any words to speak.`
` She thought that when first meeting an unknown guest, her first words should ask that person's name.`
` But without saying anything, ...Shannon knew this person's name, so she refrained.`
` No, ......surely as a person of this island, asking this person for her name would be the greatest disrespect.`
` Because, ...she was a master of this island in addition to Kinzo.`
`"B, .........Beatrice-sama............"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am Beatrice.`
` .........The face people first make when they see me hasn't changed after one thousand years.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`The witch giggled at how Shannon's reaction didn't betray her expectations.`
` Shannon realized that she had met with a being that mustn't be met with, and she took a step backwards.`
`......That's where the wall and the portrait were, so even as she gazed at the witch, she supported the witch's portrait on her back.`
`"Your worries are due to love.`
` ......Which is the single element of the world.`
` In other words, everything of this world.`
` ......When that is not fulfilled, it means the world is not fulfilled.`
` It is like continually scooping water into a flask with a hole in it.`
` ......Even if you scoop and scoop, it is never filled, an eternal desert of the heart.`
` The original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of."`
`"Understand?`
` What Adam and Eve learned when they put the fruit of knowledge to their lips was love.`
` ...Because of that, humans were chased out of the garden and became 'human'.`
` Which means that what makes one human is knowing love and suffering.`
` ......You are a girl with a kind heart.`
` You should be praised.`
` Now that you have known that, you are no longer furniture.`
` You are now 'human'.`
` I recognize that upon my name."`
`"...............umm, .........u......"`
`"Hmph.`
` Is it hard for a common person to understand?`
` ...Oh, well.`
` *cackle*cackle*...`
` Forgive me.`
` It has been a long time since I have spoken with a human.`
` I shall apologize for my talkativeness."`
`Without expecting a reply from Shannon, Beatrice laughed pleasantly for a while.`
`"Saying my apology is one thing, `
`......but would it be alright if I granted that desire of yours with my power?"`
`"...Huh..."`
`The meaning of those words surprised Shannon even more than the witch's sudden appearance.`
`"I am offering to bring you and the one you love together.`
` ......Normally, I would demand something of equal value in return."`
`"...*cackle* However, I am in a good mood.`
` And you have never failed to pay your respects to me in the past.`
` That is something worth rewarding."`
`"............I, ............is that true......?"`
`Normally, Shannon would have been shocked by this guest who didn't seem possible, and wouldn't have been able to speak.`
`......However, almost as though she had been captured by the witch's trick,`
` ...Shannon responded to the witch.`
`"If I use magic, it is no trouble at all to arrange for a pair of people with feelings for each other to be joined."`
`Yes, that's true.`
` ...Shannon, who almost said that without thinking, gave up on her last bit of common sense.`
` After all, this is a witch.`
` A sinister being.`
` The witch Beatrice is clearly trying to slip in through the cracks in my heart and take me prisoner......`
` That sort of temptation, which so many fairy tale picture books warned me about when I was young, is right in front of me now.`
`"Fear is also a form of respect.`
` It may be pleasant for me, but we will make no progress this way."`
`"......I may be no different from the image of a detestable witch that you hold in your mind.`
` However, I grant my favor to those who respect me.`
` Aren't humans the same?`
` Well, I doubt any human would grant their favor to a hostile attitude like that."`
`".........M, ......my apologies...`
` I didn't mean..."`
`Shannon eventually realized that her hostility was rude to this guest.`
` And, ...she finally digested the words that had been spoken to her a short while ago.`
`'You are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".'`
`......As she reflected upon those words,`
` ......Shannon felt as though the reason for all her worries was starting to become clear...`
`"......What was that, umm, `
`............just now, `
`......about a reward?"`
`"I say that I can arrange for you to be bound to the man who has captured your heart.`
` You can think of it as a form of gratitude for diligently polishing my portrait all the time."`
`"........................"`
`"Calm yourself. I ask for nothing in return.`
` I am generous. `
`.........However, though I ask for nothing in return, I do have a request."`
`Look, here it comes...`
` Part of Shannon's heart sent her a warning.`
` This is what all those scary picture books she had read in when she was little had warned her about......!`
`"Do you know of the small torii and shrine that have been constructed on the ocean very near this island, which you can see when you gaze at the cliffs...?"`
`...Shannon immediately remembered it.`
` When you reached Rokkenjima by boat, there was a torii and a shrine on a reef which was too small to even be called an islet.`
` I have the feeling that Kumasawa-san told me its history, but I can't remember well.`
`...A traveling mountaineering ascetic or someone had built it or wished it or something.`
`"...Yes, I know about it, but...`
`...what does, that.........?"`
`"I will not explain everything from square one to a person who does not know of demons.`
` To make a long story short, ......it is restraining me. `
`...Actually, there is mirror kept inside that shrine.`
` I want you to break that."`
`That was a very suspicious request.`
` She didn't know the details, but anything that might be stored inside a shrine would have to be something sacred.`
`......She wants me to break that? `
`Why would a witch be unable to do that herself, forcing her to ask a human for help...? `
`There was no need for Shannon to speak her thoughts aloud.`
` Beatrice started talking about this reasonable question before Shannon could give her answer.`
`"The magic power of that mirror opposes my magic power.`
` ......I cannot explain it well with human words.`
` ...For example, let us speak of the differences between utensils.`
` That mirror is a fork, and my power is soup.`
` You cannot drink soup with a fork, correct?`
` If only the push of that mirror were gone, I could prepare a spoon perfect for drinking soup.`
` ......If only that were to happen, I could drink soup, and even dig my way out of a rocky prison.`
` ...I could even scoop eyeballs out, ......is that what it was?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I, .........I don't know what you are talking about.`
` ...If that is because I am uncultured, I apologize."`
`"It comes down to this.`
` If you take action and break that annoying mirror for me,`
` as a reward, I will grant you your wish."`
`"......I am in a very good mood today.`
` If you want to, you may change your wish, and I can give you all of the gold I bestowed upon Kinzo, alright?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, ............I refuse........."`
`"......What did you say?"`
`When she heard Shannon's words, Beatrice realized for the first time that her expectations had been betrayed.`
`"If there is a reason, tell me.`
` If there is a misunderstanding, I shall resolve it."`
`"......I, ...I don't really understand the reason. `
`.........But, ...until today, the island had been in peace, and nothing bad has happened.`
` ...So, even if I don't break the mirror, the peace that has existed until today should continue into the future."`
`"Hmm...`
` I see, I see, that is quite right.`
` It's just as you say.`
` If you don't break that, the same unbreakable days that have passed until today will continue into tomorrow and the next day.`
` Why don't I give you an absolute guarantee?"`
`"I shall stake my name, Beatrice, on it.`
` The unbreakable days until today will continue into tomorrow and the next day.`
` And for eternity, in perpetuity."`
`Shannon was trapped by a creepy hallucination.`
` The mirror was probably something to restrain the witch.`
`...So breaking the mirror should have been something done for the witch's sake.`
`......But it felt as though Shannon had to do it for her own sake.`
` It seemed like some premise had been switched...`
`"What I will do is nothing more than give you a chance to fulfill your feelings as a reward.`
` ......It's up to you whether you try to break it or not.`
` If you break it, I will grant your wish."`
`"If you don't break it, the tomorrows up until today will continue for all eternity.`
` Your wish will not be granted for all eternity.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` What I am saying?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch spoke.`
` She was pressing Shannon, saying that if she wanted to be joined with George, break the mirror.`
` And she was announcing that if Shannon didn't break it, then her feelings would definitely never be fulfilled......`
`"...Please...stop it......`
` I don't, `
`......want to hear something like that.........!"`
`"I didn't want to cause you pain.`
` ......Oh well.`
` Feeling madness from love is the best thing about humans.`
` You should enjoy that emotion to your heart's content."`
`"However, if you wish to borrow my power, you can break that mirror at any time.`
` And you can yell my name and awaken me.`
` I will definitely keep my promise.`
` ......This way, you should have no complaints, right?`
` I won't force you to decide right now.`
` Are you comfortable?"`
`In the end, was that something she was comfortable with?`
`......Definitely not.`
` To Shannon, who was burning with and worried by love, being tempted forever with a way to escape that path was truly a cruel test...`
`"I won't set a time limit on that promise, `
`......but there is a time limit on the magic that can grant that wish.`
` ...That limit is not something I have decided.`
` The person of your feelings will decide it himself.`
` .........Do you know what that means?"`
`"......I, I don't know."`
`"The limit is the time that the person of your feelings chooses the person he should pledge his love to.`
` ......I am a witch, but I am not a demon.`
` I do not have a power which can tear apart two who love each other, you see...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`I hear that the person of your thoughts will soon be attending a marriage meeting, right...? `
`You may have stronger feelings for that man than anyone else in the world.`
` However, that doesn't mean that you are the most appropriate for him, does it...? `
`I know who he will be having the marriage meeting with.`
` That girl is the most suitable for Ushiromiya George in the entire world.`
` She came from a good school, achieved good grades, and has composure and prudence.`
` She is more beautiful than you, wiser than you, more suitable than you.`
` Why would a ignorant, incompetent, uncultured girl like you be suitable?`
` You know better than anyone.`
` You are the most unsuitable!`
` Even imagining that you and Ushiromiya George could be joined is sinful, and foolish, foolish foolish, know your place!!`
` Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education?`
` Know your place.`
` George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future.`
` To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant? `
`*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"S, ............stop it, don't bully Shannon!!`
` Who the hell are you?!!"`
`At that time, as Shannon held her head, trying to protect her heart from the blade of Beatrice's words, Kanon ran in front of her.`
` Kanon didn't care who this woman was.`
` As long as he knew she was an enemy that was tormenting Shannon, who he loved and respected as a sister, nothing else mattered.`
`".........Kanon-kun..., `
`stay back...!`
` This person is......!"`
`"........................"`
`It seemed that Kanon also realized that the being standing before him was the witch of the portrait.`
`...And also that she was a terrifying being.`
`"......I just wanted to make Shannon take her reward, but it seems I said too much, and ended up tormenting her.`
` I shall apologize."`
`"......But I will leave that promise as a reward to you.`
` If you need my power, call me at any time.`
` I have already told you how."`
`".........Well then, now, let us disperse.`
` Hostile gazes may be pleasant, but they are bad for your figure, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Disappear...!!`
` I don't know who you are, but you're threatening Shannon!`
` Don't ever show yourself again!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon's words made the witch horribly displeased.`
`"......So, you do not choose your words carefully, lowborn?`
` ...I am gracious to those who respect me, but brutal to those who do not, right...?"`
`While she still smiled, the witch's face began to twist itself...`
` And, there was a oppressive feeling that couldn't be noticed with any of the five senses, which gradually filled the room...`
` Even though they couldn't understand it, they immediately realized that it was something terrifying...`
` When you swim in the ocean. and something large goes by in the water beneath you, you want to escape to the land even before you learn what it is.`
` ...This was the same as that!`
`"P, ......please stop, Beatrice-sama!!`
` Kanon-kun is still a child.`
` I apologize for his language!"`
`"........................"`
`"..................ch."`
`Kanon blocked the way to Shannon, his body outstretched.`
` ...There was tense sweat on his forehead.`
` At that time, the witch certainly had Kanon's fate in the palm of her hand.`
`...She didn't even need to lift a finger.`
` By just twisting her own smile, she had Kanon's fate in the palm of her hand, so that she would easily crush it...`
` Kanon also understood that.`
` So he started sweating.`
` His knees felt weak...`
` However, Beatrice abruptly released that feeling of tension, and laughed.`
`".........Very well.`
` If you ask, I will permit it this time.`
` ...Kanon is it?`
` In deference to her, I shall forgive you tonight and send you off.`
` You should thank me.`
` Well then, we will disperse for tonight."`
`"............In parting, I shall leave a single souvenir.`
` Hold out the palm of your left hands, you two."`
`When Beatrice grinned broadly and snapped her fingers, `
`against their will, their left hands stretched out in front of them, and their palms opened.`
` It was a strange sensation, as though only their left hands had become someone else's.`
` It felt like only their left hands had become puppets, `
`which were being pulled by strings hanging down from the ceiling.`
`"Wh, what......, `
`are you trying to do...?!"`
`Kanon resisted, but he couldn't freely bring his hand back.`
`"Don't struggle.`
` It will be over soon."`
`When Beatrice held her pipe aloft, from inside the smoke, gold-colored sparkling dust hovered in the air.`
`......That sparkle eventually became several gold butterflies.`
` The beautiful butterflies danced freely throughout the reception hall, creating a fantastical and beautiful world.`
`...And two of those butterflies alighted on the palms of Shannon's and Kanon's hands.`
`"?!"`
`"Ouch...!"`
`There was a sharp pain, as though they had been burned.`
` When the two of them tried to examine their palms, there was no trace left of that inability to move their bodies, which had been there until a second ago.`
`".........Ah, ......a bruise...?`
` What is......"`
`On the palm of her hand, a small burn mark had been made, the size of a speck.`
`...Furthermore, it was shaped like a butterfly...`
`"Wh, ...what is this supposed to be..."`
`Apparently, Kanon had the same bruise on his hand.`
` He stared at the witch hatefully.`
`"It is a simple greeting.`
` I have no hidden motive.`
` ...It is nothing more than a bruise, so it will heal in just a few days.`
` There's not even any need to care for it.`
` That is a mark so that tomorrow, you will not forget that I truly was here, and that I made a promise with you."`
`"............The impact of a meeting with me is strong.`
` ...Sometimes, at the next morning, people try to think of their meeting with me as a dream or an illusion.`
` ............You should think slowly and carefully, Shannon.`
` ...And you should probably take a good rest, look at my mark tomorrow morning, and try thinking again."`
`"I do not use coercion for anything.`
` You should freely decide your future, by your own will.`
` .........However, to think that the object of desire could be satisfied with compensation such as this...`
` It would annoy the great artists who write plays about blighted love to no end.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Well then, let us meet again when the chance arises.`
` It truly is fun to have a conversation again after so much time.`
` Goodbye, furniture.`
` Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`Beatrice's body crumbled like smoke and blew away.`
`...It was golden smoke, ...no, a group of gold butterflies.`
` They scattered in all directions inside the reception hall, ...leaving a golden splash before disappearing into thin air.`
`......After that, only the cold silence was left.`
` The extreme silence was enough to make both of them think that they might have been daydreaming until just a moment ago...`
`...Which is why the witch had left it.`
` She had left a mark to make it impossible for them to think that this was a daydream.`
` As Shannon and Kanon thought back on the butterfly bruises on their hands, and the pain they had felt when those had been left there,`
` they kept standing still, in shock............`
` And from that day on...`
`......Shannon was tormented by days of suffering and conflict.........`
