`...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.`
` So many things had happened since early in the morning.`
` Of course they were high-strung...`
` Battler and George, who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies,`
` returned to the parlor and sat in the sofas, dazed, as though everything up until then had been a lie...`
` Only Maria was completely unchanged, and looked just like normal.`
`......When she wasn't playing pranks, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,`
` so even if she was dazed, she would probably look as she did.`
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.`
` Did Rosa think anything in particular about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people?`
`......She stared at Maria's back with a gaze that wasn't quite pleasant.`
` Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.`
`...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered at the strange atmosphere in the room.`
`......Then, she heard the details from Gohda, and was really noisy and shocked.`
`"O o o, of course you've contacted the police, right...?!`
` What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"`
`".........Please calm down and listen.`
` ...It seems that a machine was somehow done in by lightning last night.`
` Because of that, we haven't been able to use the phones..."`
`"Eeeehhh!!`
` Th, then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!"`
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical.`
` Even in this kind of situation, Rosa giggled.`
`......Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.`
`".........I've got to stay strong.`
` ......It's not just Maria.`
` I'm acting as a parent for George-kun and Battler-kun too, so I have to stay strong......"`
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.`
` So she was always treated as a child.`
` Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her brothers and sister,`
` and she had grown a complex, thinking that she must be incompetent.`
` So she had formed a passive attitude, asking her brothers and sister for advice every time something happened...`
`.........But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.`
` Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.`
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,`
` ......Rosa had to surpass this crisis as the representative of the head.`
`"............I'm not a child anymore, not a child.`
` ....................."`
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.`
` She must not wait for orders now.`
`...She had to start moving herself.`
` She picked up the receiver to the extension phone on the side table.`
`......Then she immediately remembered that the phones were down.`
` Genji and Shannon, who she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet.`
`...She had a general guess.`
` He was probably yelling about something nonsensical again, unable to control himself.`
`...His important chapel had been defiled with blood.`
` That was easy to imagine.`
` She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but unfortunately, the phones were broken.`
` Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.`
` Her old self would be so frightened that she wouldn't have been able to go see Kinzo.`
`...If she actually met him, she would probably be blamed for something and abused.`
` But now wasn't a time to be frightened.`
`.........As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.`
`"......Kumasawa-san, `
`I'm going to see Father.`
` ...Take special care of George-kun and Battler-kun.`
` ......I believe they are surely on edge right now."`
`"Yes, yes...`
` That may be true...`
`...It is truly pitiable....`
` I shall make them something warm to drink."`
`"Thank you."`
`Rosa went out into the hallway, and headed towards Kinzo's study.`
` The atmosphere in this mansion, which she had spent her younger days in and should have been full of memories, seemed somehow different...`
` Then she began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...`
`......Just then.`
` In the thin darkness down the stairs behind Rosa's back, ...something glowed.`
` It was a single fluttering gold butterfly.`
`...It fluttered around and sparkled.`
` That butterfly quietly danced without a sound.`
`......Obviously.`
` No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating.`
`.........And then, ......it stopped on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs.`
` Rosa didn't notice.`
` And even if someone who didn't know saw it, they probably wouldn't have seen anything but a single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly which had been stuck there.`
` Without noticing, Rosa continued heading to Kinzo's study......`
`".........So, how will you entertain me with this next one?`
` ...There are still many, many pieces left.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`In the parlor, which had returned to silence, the only sound was that of the TV, which Maria was watching alone.`
` If there was anything audible other than that, it was the sound of the rain which had continued on and on since last night.`
` Every one of those who had viewed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of this morning were all a dream.`
` Because Kumasawa alone hadn't seen that, she acted slightly differently.`
`...She thought that this silence was more difficult to bear, and went around trying to encourage everyone.`
`...However, it seemed that she was planning to be of some use, even though she had to be careful what she talked to them about...`
` Normally it would be time for breakfast.`
`......However, maybe it was because something like that had happened, but Gohda seemed to have forgotten to prepare a meal.`
`...No, maybe everyone was so beaten up that they had forgotten their hunger.`
` Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they would do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't.`
` But it was difficult being hungry.`
`...So, she casually made a proposal.`
`"...It seems that everyone is tired after all that has happened.`
` ......In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."`
`"......Hmm, that is a good plan.`
` I agree as well."`
`"Hoh-hoh-ho.`
` How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?`
` Yes, yes, it seems that it is near Halloween, and there are some delicious-looking pumpkin-shaped cookies on the shelf..."`
`"......Ah, Kumasawa-san, that's........."`
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing.`
`...Because she had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...`
` Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear.`
`"........................"`
`"......Battler-san, I am truly sorry!`
` ...I didn't mean anything bad, yes..."`
`"No, don't worry about it.`
` .........I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."`
`".........I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."`
`"Probably.`
` At least, until the typhoon passes, no boat will come."`
`"Y, ...yes, that is true!`
` Because the boats don't come even if there is a little wind.`
` They certainly wouldn't come during a typhoon, yes!"`
`"......It creeps me out."`
`"You think so too, Aniki?`
` Me too.`
` .........Whether the culprit was that mystery guest or not."`
`"That's right.`
` ......We've just naturally suspected the mysterious guest who calls herself Beatrice, `
`but we still cannot be sure that she is the culprit.`
`...There is still the possibility she's a victim whose body still hasn't been found."`
`"......When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand."`
`"What......, do you mean by that......?"`
`"It's simple.`
` It's just like Kumasawa baa-chan said a short while ago.`
` Right now, this island is right in the midst of the typhoon, and escape is impossible.`
` The same thing goes for the culprit.`
` .........In that case, having the crime come to light should have been the thing that the culprit most wanted to avoid."`
`"......That's right.`
` ...There was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel, and show off the fact that the corpses were there."`
`"Right, that's what it means.`
` Furthermore, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six people, `
`it should have been possible for them to hide the six corpses where they would be impossible to find."`
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died.`
` ......It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it, us.`
` You could probably claim that the magic circle was there to show it to us."`
`"...The culprit knew that they wouldn't be able to run away from this island for a while.`
` ......And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon.`
` ......What, does this mean?`
` ...If I was the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the corpses."`
`"............Beatrice-sama was not in her room.`
` ...The room did not seem particularly disturbed.`
` ......Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."`
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"`
`"Kanon-san is looking after her.`
` ...They are probably in Milady's room."`
`"............That isn't good.`
` ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.`
` ......In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."`
`"Wh, what do you mean by that...?`
` Y, y, you don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!`
` Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`"Let us remain calm...`
` That is not yet certain..."`
`"But even if it's stressful, we can't deny that the possibility exists. Ihihi. `
`......This letter was in the chapel.`
` According to this, the culprit is the witch, `
`and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, they'll massacre the whole family..., something like that."`
`"Is that true...!`
` Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"`
`"Hi, hi..., hi, hieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... eeeeeeeeee...hh..."`
`"......Umumumumumumumu......"`
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been...`
` Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.`
`".........If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold, is it? `
`...Screwing around with us.`
` I'll bet you can't solve the riddle, so you're trying to make us solve it...!"`
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.`
` Madam always stated that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than an illusion created by the Master.`
` ......It is doubtful whether that actually existed..."`
`"True...`
` Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it existed, and only somewhat believed it.`
` ......All of the relatives started believing in the Legend of the Gold after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.`
` I believe there are very few people who believe it very much."`
`"...Really, is that so?`
` Do you remember?`
` On the table in the chapel.`
` ...There were three gold ingots.`
` That alone is worth quite a lot.`
` Couldn't that truly prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"`
`"E, ...excuse me, ...please wait.`
` Just now, did you say three gold bars......?"`
`"......Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.`
` So what?"`
`"Well, umm, I, .........happened to hear Krauss-sama say something.`
` ......Yes, I just heard it, right?!`
` It's not like I was trying to listen to secret discussions, yes!"`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` So then what?`
` What's wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"`
`"...Y, yes.`
` According to Krauss-sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."`
`"......That is correct.`
` I do believe the story goes that Kinzo-san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold, and let him take one bar back with him."`
`"And that one came to be in Krauss-sama's possession.`
` And, he also said that `
` was no gold which supported the Master's Legend of the Gold besides that one..."`
`"You're talking about Krauss oji-san here?`
` So what does that mean? `
`......No wait, ......3?!`
` Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many, right?!"`
`"Might you not think of it this way?`
` Maybe the other people in the family each found one, and they each brought one of them there..."`
`"No, I cannot believe that.`
` When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.`
` I did not feel a suspicious weight back then."`
`"......I think those would weigh about 10kg.`
` If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.`
` But it didn't seem that way."`
`"Same here.`
` At the most, there were some changes of clothes, medicine, Kyrie-san's makeup.`
` Stuff like that, I think.`
` Rosa oba-san's luggage also looked pretty light."`
`"......In that case, those three piled up gold bars were being shown to them...or maybe us.`
` ......The Legend of the Gold is definitely real.`
` It isn't an illusion.`
` They're trying to force us to uncover the gold."`
`"Could there be a scheme, ...to have us solve the epitaph which points to the hidden location, and then try to snatch it away?"`
`"............That does fit.`
` ...But there are a couple parts that don't make sense.`
` First, our parents, who should have been the most likely to solve the epitaph, were killed first.`
` I think that suddenly creates a contradiction."`
`".........And something else makes even less sense.`
` ......If they're trying to say that the Legend of the Gold is actually true,`
`why would they pile up that gold?`
` ......It's almost like the culprit has already found the gold...`
` and is telling us to try and find it too."`
`"Maybe the culprit, like Krauss oji-san, obtained those three and is therefore certain about the Legend of the Gold, and is trying to make us search for the rest...`
` I think that way fits the best."`
`"..................`
`......The pieces on the chessboard aren't lined up at all.`
` ............We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, what they want to make us do.`
` ............Is it pointless?`
` No matter what we think, at this point in time...`
`..............."`
`"......Kihihi.`
` It was written down.`
` What she wanted to do.`
` Couldn't anyone read it, kihihihihihihihihihi."`
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.`
`...I'd thought she had been concentrating on the TV, but she was also listening in, apparently.`
` As she remained facing the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.`
`"Beatrice hasn't said once that she wants the gold.`
` ......I haven't heard that she's said anything except talking about whether we can solve the riddle of the epitaph or not. `
`...Although I think it's just impossible.`
` ......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"......So you're saying you can solve it, Maria?"`
`"...Do-n't know.`
` After all, she'll take Maria to the Golden Land.`
` Won't get in Beatrice's way. `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch."`
`"In any case, it looks like to understand any more than this, there's nothing we can do except ask Maria.`
` ...Maria, tell us.`
` ............Who is this Beatrice?`
` What is she planning?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` You know, Beatrice is a witch!`
` She can do anything with her strange power. `
`Anything can be done with the power of magic.`
` You can even create gold, even create bread.`
` And of course, you can create sweets, right?`
` You saw, didn't you?`
` Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi hihihihihihihihihihihi!"`
` `
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being closed forcefully.`
` When we turned around, Rosa had suddenly returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.`
`......Then she rapidly approached Maria, her heels squeaking, and hit her on the cheek.`
`"......Stop talking about that.`
` Battler-kun and the rest will take it badly."`
`"...............Uu-..."`
`Without waiting for a response, she hit Maria's cheek once more.`
` Everyone could only stand there, shocked.`
`"I don't know what uu- means.`
` What about yes?"`
`"............Uu-."`
`She mercilessly hit Maria's cheek again.`
`......Maybe she didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice.`
` Maria weakly said yes.`
`"R, ......Rosa-san, there was no reason to do something so harsh..."`
`"...This is my daughter's education.`
` Do not interrupt."`
`The atmosphere around Rosa, accompanied by Genji and Shannon, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,`
` ...completely different from how she had seemed before she left.`
` We saw that Rosa oba-san was holding something that looked like a gun.`
`......I couldn't imagine that she would be holding a toy in this situation.`
`"Rosa oba-san, what is...?"`
`"......This is Father's.`
` Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.`
` .........Everyone should understand.`
` The culprit is still nearby.`
` We don't know what could be there."`
`"............I agree.`
` ......Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."`
`"........................."`
`"Father was alright, but he was slightly distracted by these sudden events.`
` ...Fortunately, he said that he won't leave his room, so he's probably safe.`
` Now, we should do all we can to gather in the same place."`
`"...I agree.`
` We don't even know where the culprit is hiding, so, ......anyway, there's no proof that there's only one of them.`
` ............"`
`I said it myself, and shivered.`
` That's right.`
` Could a single person kill six people and create such a horrible scene all alone?`
`......Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?`
`"......I agree with Rosa-san.`
` It is probably good for us to gather in one place."`
`"Yes, yes, I also think that is good, yes, yes!"`
`".........Maybe it would be good to call Milady and Kanon-san here by now."`
`"That's right.`
` ......Let's have them come down."`
`George-aniki tried to grab the extension phone, but Gohda-san shook his head.`
`......That's right, we couldn't use the phones right now.`
`"......I'll go with a couple people.`
` If George-aniki and Gohda-san also come, that should be enough."`
`"............No.`
` Let's all go together. `
`...It's a 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
` If we're all gathered together in equilibrium, that situation is the most safe."`
`"...'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'?"`
`"......Uu-.`
` Maria, has it.`
` Show you."`
`"Maria, turn off the television.`
` ......Genji-san.`
` Please tell me where Jessica-chan's room is.`
` Let's all go together."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will guide you."`
`"Come on, everyone.`
` We'll move together.`
` Follow my instructions."`
`We stood up.`
` Maria alone looked like she had some regrets about the TV, but she went along with everyone for now, and got up.`
`"...Shannon, thank goodness.`
` I was worried when you took so long to get back."`
`"I am sorry to have worried you.`
` The Master ordered me to copy down something..."`
`"Copy down?"`
`"............Shannon."`
`"I, .........I am sorry, excuse me..."`
`We headed for Jessica's room, with Rosa oba-san, holding the gun, and Genji-san in the lead.`
` Jessica and Kanon-kun were a boy and a girl of about the same age.`
` That'd sure be a shame if we walked in on them at a bad ti-me, or at least that's what we would be joking about normally.`
` However, Rosa oba-san was on edge, constantly overflowing with a sense of tension.`
`...So it really wasn't the kind of atmosphere where we could joke like that.`
`"Hey, don't fall behind!!`
` Everyone move together!`
` We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, right?!"`
`...No, maybe Rosa oba-san's attitude was more appropriate.`
`......Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Rosa oba-san was the leader.`
` This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did.`
`......And Rosa oba-san was herself a mother.`
` She probably also thought that, if she didn't get a hold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.`
` The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.`
`......The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance that this opponent could take down a large number of people in an instant.`
` Was that with weapons, or with numbers?`
`......Or was it the magic of a witch? `
`In any case, it definitely didn't look like an element we could get careless about...`
` The rest of us should also take much, much greater care, like Rosa oba-san...`
`"............Everyone, stop!"`
`Rosa oba-san spoke in a sharp voice.`
` We wondered what it was, and when we peered forwards...`
`......we immediately noticed the reason...`
`".........Wh, ......what is this......"`
`"Hee, ............!"`
`"Everyone, get back...!"`
`Gohda-san and Genji-san approached the door...`
` Beyond the door, was probably Jessica's room.`
`"This, ......seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."`
`"......It appears so.`
` It appears that not much time has passed since it was drawn."`
`"What is that......`
`......another, ...magic circle?!"`
`"......It's the first magic circle of the moon.`
` ...It has the power to open unopened doors."`
`The door to Jessica's room, ......had that creepy scribble on it which had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`......That strange pattern definitely had some meaning related to the occult.`
` But it didn't matter what that meaning was.`
` We were worried about whether those two were alright.`
`"Th, that doesn't matter!`
` Are Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun alright?!"`
`"...I have a bad premonition...`
` We should quickly take those two downstairs."`
`"Milady! `
`Milady!! `
`Are you there? `
`Please answer!!"`
`Gohda-san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.`
` He gripped the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.`
`"......Rosa-sama, it seems to be locked."`
`"There are no other options.`
` Please open it."`
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.`
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.`
`......A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
` And six corpses had been behind that.`
`......So, if there was a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ......then beyond it............`
`"Je, ............Jessica-sama!!"`
`"Wh, what happened?`
` Is she there?!"`
`"Jessica!!`
` What happened?!!"`
`......It was truly heartless.`
`...The expression on Gohda-san's face and what he said when he opened the door, `
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica might have met, even without seeing her...`
` Everyone rushed into Jessica's room at once.`
`...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were right on...`
`"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`".........How......horrible......`
`...D, ...Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`Inside the room, which seemed elegant for her age, Jessica had fallen over.`
` There was a large pool of blood on the floor.`
`......And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back......`
`...Was it a knife? `
`There was a design in the handle that had to have been done in a devil motif.`
` Was it a weapon with some occult meaning? Definitely.`
`"...This is, .........horrible.`
` ...She has passed away.`
` ......This, probably, reached her lungs...`
`......Not much time has passed since she died."`
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!! `
`Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......B, Battler-sama......"`
`"I was naive!! `
`I knew it!! `
`Since they couldn't escape the island, the culprit was definitely close by!`
` Then why didn't I get cautious sooner!!`
` ......I was naive!! `
`I just assumed that the culprit would commit a crime and then sneak away!"`
`"......We were stunned then.`
` We thought it was just too bad that Jessica-chan gave in to rage and ran off.`
` ......But we were naive.`
` We should have stopped her...!"`
`"...Gohda-san, why did you leave those two alone!`
` If only you had been with them, something like this...!!"`
`"N, no, t, ...that is, umm!!`
` I said it was dangerous so we should return!`
` It's just that, Milady said that she wanted to be alone!`
` Kanon-san told me to leave it to him, and...! `
`......Speaking of which, where is Kanon-san...?!"`
`"That's right!`
` What in the world happened to Kanon-kun?!"`
`"K, ......Kanon-kun...`
` Where........."`
`"Kanon-san should have been with Milady...`
` Where in the world...!"`
`"You don't think, they got him...?!"`
`"........................`
` Quiet.`
` .........Someone might be hiding in this room.`
` Search under the bed and in the closet."`
`There was a chance that Kanon-kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere.`
` At Rosa-san's order, everyone searched throughout the room together.`
`......But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere.`
`"......He's nowhere!!`
` Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!`
` Then we have to search for him quickly and save him!`
` ......If we're slow, something awful might happen!!`
` Rosa oba-san, let's search all over the mansion!`
` Let's search for the culprit!`
` Let's save Kanon-kun!!"`
`"...............`
`............Quiet!!!"`
`When Rosa oba-san yelled at us with a loud voice, we fell instantly silent.`
` She was probably contemplating something.`
`...However, what in the world could that be......?`
`...Rosa oba-san walked around the room as though looking for something, or as though she was collecting her thoughts.`
`............Then, she found something on the side table by the bed, and picked it up.`
`"............If anyone knows, tell me.`
` ......Which key is this?"`
`Rosa oba-san showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.`
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing what key it was.`
`"......It is probably the key to this, ...to Milady's room."`
`After hearing that, Rosa oba-san made a point of going outside the door and checking.`
`.........Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.`
`"............I wonder why it was set in a place like this.`
` Normally, don't you keep an important key in your pocket?"`
`"...Umm, ............Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room.`
` It seems she would only do it when she went to school,`
` because she didn't want Krauss-sama to look inside her room..."`
`".........I see.`
` She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica-chan would set the key down here.`
` How many keys can open this door?"`
`"J, ...just the one Milady had..."`
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?"`
`"......They can open it."`
`"How many master keys are there?`
` Are all of the servants holding them?`
` Are there extras?"`
`"Yes.`
` We are all holding them.`
` .........As for extras, ...I wonder."`
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam strongly scolded us that this was careless, so they should have been dealt with."`
`"......That is correct.`
` There is only one held by each servant.`
` There are no more."`
`"...Nn?`
` Wait a second.`
` ...I think we talked about extra master keys in the last game, right?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Well, regarding that.`
` I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."`
`"......That's probably right.`
` Since you want to make me believe in magic by using closed rooms, it would be really disadvantageous for you if there were more master keys than we supposed.`
` ...In any event, every time a trick related to locks shows up,`
` I planned to resist by arguing that the culprit possessed a master key that someone had lost in the past, or a duplicate."`
`"Yes, that's correct.`
` So I've decided to make a move to defeat that.`
` ......I'll alter the setup."`
`"`
`{p:1:The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each}.`
` *cackle*cackle*"`
`"...Messing with me.`
` ......More importantly.`
` What is this move?`
` ......What's Rosa oba-san saying."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Who knows?`
` You should try listening in."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I have the situation sorted out. `
`......And I've been able to specify the culprit who assaulted Jessica-chan, or maybe one of their accomplices."`
`"Wh, what did you say...?!`
` Who is that?!"`
`"...Rosa oba-san, you couldn't be talking about Kanon-kun...?"`
`"......Huh, ......eeeeh?!`
` Wh, why Kanon-kun?!"`
`"This room was locked.`
` And the only keys that can unlock this room are the master keys that each servant is holding, as well as the key Jessica had.`
` ......But Jessica-chan's key was closed up in here.`
` ...Which means it is only possible that one of the master keys locked it."`
`".........It is as you say."`
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica, then locked the door!`
` That person was holding a master key.`
` And there are only five people who are holding master keys!"`
`"O, oh my!!`
` It wasn't me, not me!`
` Yes, I couldn't do something like that!"`
`"......Kumasawa-san got up late.`
` After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there, `
`but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time.`
` You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."`
`"A, are you saying that I visited Milady's room, `
`and did something so horrible?! `
`I, I, I did no such thing!`
` Yes, no such thing!!"`
`"What about Gohda-san?`
` You said that you left Jessica-chan in Kanon-kun's care and returned. `
`...But I wonder if that's true?`
` ......I wonder if you didn't really kill the two of them, hide Kanon-kun's corpse,`
` and then come back with an innocent look on your face?!"`
`"Nothing of the sort happened!`
` I, Gohda, swear that I did not do anything like that!!"`
`"......I, it wasn't us...!!`
` We were following the Master's orders..."`
`"Yes.`
` At least you and Genji-san are alright.`
` That is backed up by what I heard from Father.`
` The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, copying and witnessing for him.`
` Father and I can guarantee that."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"In that case, I think the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` ......I even thought that as soon as I entered this room.`
` .........But still, I thought it was strange.`
` Look at the state of Jessica-chan's body.`
` Doesn't everyone think it's strange?"`
`"......Strange, ...you say...?"`
`"Jessica-chan was struck in the back.`
` .........Come on, it's often generally said, right?`
` That in crimes where the victim is struck in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.`
` She definitely wouldn't invite a person that she doesn't trust into her room, and defenselessly expose her back."`
`"R, ......Rosa-sama, you couldn't mean, `
`............to say that was Kanon-kun...?"`
`"Yes.`
` We know well what state Jessica-chan was in right before she was killed. `
`......After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica-chan was very panicked.`
` And it's easy to imagine that after she regained her composure, she would be in a horrible slump."`
`"......It would be very understandable if Jessica's frame of mind lead her to shut herself up alone in her room.`
` And those particulars would also fit with Gohda-san's story."`
`"......Jessica-chan said to leave her alone.`
` ...Then Kanon-kun, who is of a similar age, and may have some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave it to him.`
` That feeling is also very understandable."`
`".........So, for that reason, I think Jessica-chan welcomed Kanon-kun into her room."`
`"But what if it had been Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` Would she have let them into her room?"`
`"......I, I believe that I have gained Milady's trust.`
` But even so, err..."`
`"Then you are another suspect after all, right, Gohda-san?`
` I thought that you probably weren't liked by Jessica-chan, so I believed she wouldn't have let you into her room. `
`So I thought it was impossible that you were the culprit, but...?"`
`"No, umm...!`
` .........I am afraid to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady. `
`...Wh, what about you, Kumasawa-san?"`
`"Ho, hohohohohoho! `
`A senior like me is far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...`
` And perhaps Milady did not open her heart up to me.`
` Right, Gohda-san?!"`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` She probably did not open her heart to us to a great degree!`
` It would be inconceivable that Milady would let us into her room when she was heartbroken!"`
`Gohda-san and Kumasawa baa-chan each rubbed their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.`
` It was a really unpleasant rondo.`
`"Someone who would be permitted to enter Jessica-chan's room when she was heartbroken.`
` Who would have been given access to her defenseless back.`
` And that person had a master key.`
` That only points to one person.`
` ......It was impossible for anyone except Kanon-kun."`
`"P, ......please, wait...!`
` Kanon-kun definitely wouldn't do something like...!"`
`"Oh, then is there someone else?`
` Is Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san suspicious after all?`
` Who do you think is more suspicious, Shannon-chan...? Come on."`
`"I..., ......I, ...something like that............"`
`"It wasn't me, Shannon-san!`
` Yes, it was not me!"`
`"Of course, it wasn't me either!`
` The people who had close relationships with Milady were Kanon-san, and then you, Shannon-san, right?!"`
`".........Yeah, isn't that right?`
` ......Jessica-chan might also let Shannon-chan into her room. `
`But you should have been with Father.`
` .........But in reality, `
`......were you the culprit............?"`
`"Sh, ......Shannon couldn't be the culprit!`
` Didn't you just say that she was doing some important work with Grandfather!"`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` Neither Shannon-chan nor Genji-san is the culprit.`
` Father also admits that they were together the whole time.`
` .........Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"`
`After being told that, no one could respond...`
` Even if someone did argue back, they would then have to offer the name of a different suspicious person.`
`......And no matter whose name that was, that person was here.`
`...No one could do something like that.`
` Rosa oba-san glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...`
`.........She seemed so different from the Rosa oba-san who was usually kind.`
`...No, it's probably because I don't feel the danger we're in.`
`...Maybe Rosa oba-san's attitude would seem natural if I really felt how much danger we were in...`
`"It seems that no one has an opinion.`
` Then I will say mine."`
`"Of course, I cannot deny that Kanon-kun is a victim without a corpse.`
` But until we find his corpse, I definitely can't deny the possibility that Kanon-kun is a suspect.`
` ......There's a chance that Kanon-kun was attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere..., `
`and with that as an excuse, he may appear unexpectedly."`
`"But take care.`
` Maybe, no, definitely.`
`.........Kanon-kun killed Jessica-chan."`
`"............N, ...............no way........."`
`"I, ...I can't believe it...`
` Kanon did, `
`.........to Milady, `
`......that's too much!!"`
`"I feel the same as Shannon.`
` I oppose labeling Kanon-kun as the culprit."`
`"Then is the culprit Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san?`
` Tell me who's more suspicious."`
`""I I I, It wasn't us!!""`
`"If it wasn't Kanon-kun, then who could have opened this door?`
` Shannon-chan.`
` George-kun.`
` ......Right?`
` Right right right...?"`
`Rosa oba-san closed in on Shannon-chan and George-aniki, laughing unpleasantly.`
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back.`
` They wanted to believe in Kanon-kun.`
`...But if they did, they would have to suspect the other servants.`
` The simplest culprit was the mystery guest Beatrice.`
`......But she was nothing more than a guest, and didn't have a master key.`
`.........Then if Beatrice was the culprit without a master key...`
`...Do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, and locked the door with the power of magic......?`
`"............That's a filthy argument...`
`......filthy......, filthy......"`
`"What are you worried about?`
` Make it my fault.`
` You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, right?`
` If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans pressing each other, right...? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"So then what.`
` The culprit is the 19th person, the guest Beatrice.`
` ...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key using magic. `
`Are you telling me to accept that?`
` Damn it...!`
` ...Damn it, damn it...!!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` In the last game, I learned all of your weak points.`
` So, what will you do, what will you do...?`
` You definitely weren't going to accept me, right?`
` Then, .........you can use Kanon as a perfect sacrifice."`
`"Kanon killed Jessica!`
` If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, right?`
` Kanon is already dead.`
` There should be no need to show concern for the dead.`
` And, you won't have to doubt anyone here! `
`*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"Damn it!!`
` I won't accept you!!!`
` But, ......Kanon-kun being the culprit, ......that's impossible!!"`
`"..........I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` ...However, it is sometimes the case that the suspicious are the guilty.`
` ......Anyway, there is probably nothing better than caution..."`
`"D, ...Doctor Nanjo...`
` What do you mean by that...?"`
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.`
` ...I do not wish to label Kanon-san as the culprit.`
` ......However, until we understand the situation, there is the possibility that Kanon-san is the culprit,`
` and I believe thinking that way is safer."`
`"Ho, ......hoh-hoh-ho...`
` Yes, that's right..., you cannot be too cautious."`
`It didn't seem as though anyone blamed Nanjo.`
` In reality, no one thought that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...But if they did not suspect him, they would have to suspect one of the servants here.`
`......We didn't want to do that.`
` We didn't want to suspect.`
` We didn't want to be suspected.`
`"That is correct.`
` ......We cannot be too vigilant.`
` Is there anyone who objects to that?"`
`"Alright?`
` ...There is a very high likelihood that this murder case is related to Father's Legend of the Gold.`
` In that case, it's certainly the crime of someone plotting to keep a vast amount of gold worth several ten billion yen all for themselves.`
` ......With that amount of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.`
` ...It may be possible that they would massacre us for this reason."`
`".................."`
`"Because she wasn't holding a master key, the 19th person, `
`the guest Beatrice, is removed from suspicion only for the murder of Jessica-chan.`
` But we cannot say that she is unrelated to the crime. `
`......After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about.`
` We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.`
` ......Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"`
`As Rosa oba-san yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.`
`......Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you, ...that's what she was saying.`
` But no one wanted to suspect.`
`...They didn't want to suspect anyone here.`
` That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not here...`
`"There are only two ways you can be sure someone isn't a suspect.`
` .........If it's yourself, or if they're already no more than a corpse.`
` .........The same goes for Kanon-kun."`
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica-chan's murder!!`
` So take care.`
` Even if he's still alive, even if he smoothes things over with some explanation, you definitely must not trust him!`
` Alright?!"`
`No one gave a answer of their own initiative.`
`......However, those who met Rosa oba-san's eyes had to nod their heads...`
` Humans are beings who live by molding themselves to fit society.`
`......In other words, from the time they are born, trusting each other is genetically imprinted on them.`
`...It is, unpleasant to go against that.`
` They definitely don't want to suspect someone.`
`...But if they had to suspect someone, `
`...they thought that choosing one of the people not here right now would be the safest.`
` For just the reason of safety, they half-heartedly chose Kanon to be the sacrifice.`
` That's ridiculous.........`
` I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon-kun is the culprit! `
`I'd heard it from George-aniki just now, but not only were those two close in age, `
`they also had that adolescent relationship Rosa oba-san had mentioned.`
`......It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.`
` After seeing her parent's tragic corpses, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon-kun.`
`...That was a very conceivable story.`
` So I don't like it...!! `
`Kanon-kun was the only one she trusted.`
` So she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon-kun in.`
` So, this argument saying Kanon-kun was the only one who could have killed Jessica, ......I just couldn't accept it......!!!`
`"...Understand?!`
` Even if Kanon-kun appears, don't get careless!`
` As long as we cannot prove Kanon-kun's innocence, we will suppose that Kanon-kun is the culprit who killed Jessica-chan!!"`
`Rosa oba-san made that claim.`
` By using the vague word 'suppose', ...in the end, she encouraged everyone.`
` Everyone nodded weakly, `
`............and, under the temporary excuse that they were just supposing it, `
`.........they 'claimed' that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...`
`.........I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.`
` Jessica, was crying.`
`......She was crying in the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her, Kanon.`
` It was frustrating.`
` So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...`
` She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...`
`"...Those guys, ...why are they treating Kanon-kun like the culprit!!"`
`".....................Because there's, ...no corpse."`
`"Why are they treating you like the culprit because there's no corpse?!`
` You risked your life to fight for me, right...?! `
`Then, ......that witch erased the corpse for fun......!`
` After that, Kanon-kun being the culprit, it's horrible, it's too horrible!!"`
`"......It's alright.`
` ......In the end, I couldn't completely protect you, but...`
`.........I was able to be of use to Milady..."`
`"......Why doesn't everyone understand that?!`
` Stop it, Rosa oba-san!!`
` Don't call Kanon-kun the culprit with that messed up reasoning!!"`
`".........She isn't saying that I'm the culprit.`
` ...She's just saying I'm suspicious, `
`......no, `
`......she's saying to be careful."`
`"She is saying it!!`
` These people are saying you're the culprit, Kanon-kun, so they can stop thinking!`
` They aren't thinking about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!`
` They aren't thinking of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!!`
` And after this, every time something happens, they'll repeat the excuse that it was the work of Kanon-kun, whose location is unknown!!`
` ......I can't stand that!!"`
`"............It's alright.`
` ...At least Milady knows the truth."`
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!!`
` I know after dying.`
` Truth belongs to living humans!!`
` If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!!`
` They won't know why Kanon-kun risked his life!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Truly a splendid sight.`
` You hardly ever find a sweeter honey than the laments of the dead."`
`"Lament, lament.`
` No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."`
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!! `
`It doesn't matter who!!`
` Hear my voice!!`
` Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Kanon-kun's corpse was just erased!`
` Why, why don't you understand that?!!"`
`".........Milady."`
`"......I can't stand that!!`
` It's sad!`
` It's vexing!!`
` Don't, ......you care that Kanon-kun's dead?!!`
` The honor of the dead must be accepted by the living!`
` It doesn't matter who!`
` Notice it!`
` Notice it, I beg you!!`
` Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, everyone!!`
` Please, don't let it end like this......!`
` Don't go, ......don't goooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Rosa proclaimed that this room should be sealed until the police came.`
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.`
`......For now, they accepted that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.`
`"......Milady..., it's alright now...`
`......Thank you......"`
`"Don't go!!`
` Don't go everyone!! `
`For heaven's sake, come back!!`
` Don't leave us like this!!"`
`"Don't leave us, ......still treating Kanon-kun......as the culpriiiiiiiit!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"It won't reach!!`
` The laments of the dead never reach!"`
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!`
` Did you think your voice would reach?`
` It won't reach, will it, Jessicaaaaaaa??? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"It's all useless."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Battler-kun, did you say something?"`
`"Yeah, it's useless.`
`...It's all useless."`
`At the time everyone made to leave the room...`
`...Only Battler had his back to them, and he was still looking down at Jessica's corpse.`
`"What do you mean, ...it's all useless?`
` Do you have some objection...?"`
`"I'll at least agree that we have to be vigilant.`
` ......But this talk about having Kanon-kun be the culprit, sorry, but allow me to refuse."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So you're biting into this part.`
` If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing, how do you explain this closed room that Jessica's room has become...?"`
`".........Honestly, I give up there.`
` ...Seriously, why'd I say it's all useless?"`
`"...I don't take any responsibility for my own conduct.`
` Ihihihihi...! `
`............I'm empty-handed with zero weapons to argue with. `
`...But you know, I won't hold my finger to my lips anymore!! Beatrice!!"`
`"B, ......Battler-sama......"`
`"......I, is there some proof that Kanon-kun isn't the culprit......?"`
`The expression that rose to the faces of those two was definitely expectant.`
`......They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.`
` They really believed Kanon.`
` So this expectation was because they wanted to be made to believe him even more strongly!`
`"Then Battler-kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?`
` Gohda-san?`
` Or is it Kumasawa-san?"`
`"Quit it, Rosa oba-san.`
` ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa-chan well.`
` ......She'll sometimes slack off on work, but she'll always make things fun for people.`
` ......Even if her eyes were dazzled by money, she is not a person who would kill."`
`"B, ......Battler-sama........."`
`"And I've just met Gohda-san yesterday.`
` ......Honestly, I still don't really understand him. `
`......But there is something I understand."`
`"................I, I........."`
`"......I've never seen someone who can make food that looks so fun.`
` ...You're the same.`
` The same as Kumasawa baa-chan.`
` ......Gohda-san likes to make people happy."`
`"As if a person like that could kill those that praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"`
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica-chan, Battler-kun?`
` Who do you think shut Jessica up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"`
`"Wait.`
` ......Before I argue about that, there's something I want to make clear. `
`I don't want to talk about, if so-and-so is not the culprit, then so-and-so is the culprit.`
` ...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon-kun to be the culprit."`
`"You say that you can establish that Kanon isn't the culprit?`
` *cackle*, how?!"`
`"It's actually simple.`
` ...It's something I dangerously overlooked.`
` ......Beato!"`
`"Repeat it!!`
` If you can say it, try saying it, 'Kanon-kun was holding a master key'!!"`
`"........................Hoh...!"`
`"......Kanon-kun wasn't holding a master key?!`
` How could you know that?!"`
`"Just now, I heard what Gohda-san said.`
` Just before he split up with Kanon-kun.`
` ...The part about when Jessica went to raid the VIP room."`
`".........Gohda-san, you did a good job remembering it.`
` You protected Kanon's honor."`
`"......I, `
`......I, `
`...did...?!"`
`"I heard him say the same thing.`
` But I don't really understand!`
` Could you explain it, Battler-kun?!"`
`"......That's right. `
`When Jessica unlocked the VIP room, `
`she borrowed the key from Kanon-kun, but didn't give it back!`
` So Kanon-kun wasn't holding a master key!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Is that really so? `
`Certainly, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.`
` However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking!`
` How does that prove that it definitely didn't happen?!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, if you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you could establish that, but you can't!!`
` It is impossible to prove!!"`
`"It's all useless.`
` Isn't it actually simple?"`
`"......No way...!`
` So, you're saying that Kanon-kun wasn't holding a key?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.`
` ......Kanon-kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket. `
`Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"`
`"H, ......hmm."`
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica, and searched in her jacket pocket......`
` Everyone, ...was expectant.........!`
`"......Mu..."`
`...Please.`
` Be there............!!`
`"......Here it is!`
` Is this it?"`
`"............Yes.`
` That is a master key.`
` Without a doubt."`
`At Genji's statement, there was a small 'oooh' of joyful voices.`
`"That is Kanon-kun's master key.`
` .........I'll say it again."`
`"'Kanon-kun isn't holding a master key'.`
` Therefore, there's no way he could have locked the door!!"`
`"......It certainly does, ...appear that way. `
`......But Kanon-kun was the last person to meet Jessica-chan.`
` The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed."`
`"Let's give it a rest, ......enough doing that."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Normally, humans are supposedly creatures that trust each other.`
` ...But because we live in a tough world, we learn the depths of doubt.`
` ...So we'll doubt anything.`
` We are sad creatures.`
` ...I won't deny that's our nature."`
`"............But I won't permit statements without proof!!`
` Being suspicious doesn't make you guilty, it makes you innocent!!`
` Of course, the world is filled with wolves.`
` I won't tell you to carelessly believe everyone!"`
`"But if you're going to say someone's guilty, prepare some perfect evidence!`
` As long as you can't do that, definitely don't say someone is guilty because of speculation!!!"`
`"............u......`
` That is........."`
`"......I was the one who said the suspicious were guilty.`
` .........That was careless.`
` I apologize."`
`"............Battler-sama........."`
`"...W, wonderful reasoning, Battler-kun!`
` Thank you too, Gohda-san.`
` Because of what you remembered, Kanon-kun is cleared from suspicion!"`
`"N, no I..., hahahaha..."`
`Clap clap clap...`
`...It was the dry sound of the witch applauding.`
`"Well done, well done.`
` ......Not a bad job."`
`".........Shit.`
` Was I fooled by that bait piece just like you wanted...?"`
`"You wonderfully proved that at least Kanon couldn't lock the door to this room.`
` The servants should all have been holding master keys.`
` With that as proof, Kanon was treated as the culprit, so at least you wonderfully cleared away that suspicion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......In that case.`
` ...How did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?`
` So that's the problem that we have now. `
`Sheesh.`
` ......I've been drawn into a development that went exactly like you wanted..."`
`"Has it gotten through...?`
` Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.`
` We-ll then, it'll be worth seeing how you gloss this over..."`
`"Shut up.`
` ...Let's start right away.`
` I'll probably deny it as best I can, ...but first let's check the definition of this room as a closed room."`
`"Very well. `
`First, `
`{p:1:there are absolutely no types of hidden doors}. `
`{p:1:This door is the only way in or out}. `
`{p:1:The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant}. `
`It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window. `
`However, `
`{p:1:the window is locked from the inside}."`
`"......Let me suddenly turn the chessboard over.`
` ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I probably won't leave the palm of your hand."`
`"Do as you like.`
` Well then, well then, what should I repeat?"`
`".........Repeat it.`
` 'Kanon-kun was killed in this room'."`
`"Hmm. `
`'{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}'. `
`But I erased his corpse with magic, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Again, repeat it.`
` 'Kanon-kun's corpse is in this room'."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I refuse.`
` I can't repeat it.`
` ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"So you won't say that.`
` ......There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere.`
` ......Damn, where's the mysterious point in question?`
` .........Did they lock it without the master key?`
` Or did they somehow kill those two when they were inside the room and it was locked?`
` Or did they kill those two, and then somehow escape?"`
`"......I hate to say it, but I'll have to cover up the moat.`
` ...Repeat it.`
` ......'The last time it was locked was due to the master key'."`
`"I also refuse that.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"......This refusing thing is really vague.`
` I don't know if you refuse because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're refusing on purpose..."`
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.`
` When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to use red and say things in a risky way.`
` That's all it is."`
`".........That's right.`
` ...Originally, you used the red when you wanted to stop my strange theories."`
`"It is natural that I would use it to my advantage.`
` Because of the risk of it being quibbled with, I won't use it uselessly."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well then, what move will come next?`
` A move that puts Gohda or Kumasawa under suspicion would probably be the easiest to use, right...?"`
`"......Damn.`
` It's annoying being provoked...`
` Stay quiet a while, I'm thinking...!"`
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel. `
`{p:1:When locked, it does not permit any form of entry}. `
`I'll say more. {p:1:No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key}.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Sheesh.`
` Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..."`
`............I have a score to settle.`
`...Anyway, let me think.`
` I'll lay out everything I know.`
` First, there are two victims.`
` Jessica and Kanon-kun.`
`...Kanon-kun's corpse isn't here, but Beatrice admitted in red that Kanon-kun was killed.`
` So even without a corpse, he is included as a victim.`
` There are a few questionable points.`
` And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.`
` First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it? `
`If we assume that the culprit was one of those holding a master key, it's extremely simple.`
`......But I want to avoid that if I can.`
` Because I would have to suspect Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san, ...no, in the worst case, even Shannon-chan and Genji-san.`
` Here, I noticed something.`
`......I was contradicting myself.`
` I was restricting my own path.`
` I wanted to deny Beatrice no matter what.`
` I wanted to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch! `
`Because of that, I had to explain everything with humans, not magic.`
`......But that also meant suspecting some human.`
` I don't want to suspect someone.`
`......Of course, if there was some clear proof, I would have to believe that person was the culprit, but,`
` ...as long as that didn't happen, I didn't want to raise suspicions.`
` Was I just green...? `
`Was I just a kid who didn't want to have my feelings, which told me that at least this person or that person couldn't be a murderer, betrayed...? `
`I want to deny that it was a witch, I also want to deny that it was a human.`
`.........Now I don't know what is what anymore...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In the first place, the only victory condition in our game regarded whether or not you could deny my existence.`
` ...Even though that alone was a game that put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, and made your own victory difficult...!"`
`......It was just as she said.`
`...If I started arguing that someone holding a master key was the culprit, this closed room could be easily broken.`
`......However, the number of keys that could open this door were limited,`
` and furthermore, since it was clearly known who held those,`
` saying that meant that I was suspecting someone I knew well...`
`...No, ......am I simply averting my eyes? `
`In that closed room trick with the chapel, which had been exhilarating to destroy,`
` I had proposed that 'someone stole the key from Maria's handbag, and returned it'.`
` If that theory was right, then the question becomes who could have stolen the key from her handbag.`
`...Maria's handbag had probably been the most unguarded when she was sleeping.`
`......In that case, `
`.........in addition to me, `
`...George-aniki and Jessica are also suspects.`
` George-aniki or Jessica was the culprit? `
`Or maybe an accomplice?!`
`......All of our parents had been killed, right?! `
`And yet, ......and yet, one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?! `
`We had lamented, mourned, and shed tears in the chapel.`
`...And yet, one among us, ......had been lying?!`
`"......*cackle*cackle*.`
` That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...? `
`And despite that, how could you act like you didn't notice, `
`and say a theory like that so happily...!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"D, ............damn it...`
` That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!`
` If you snuck up on us hiding in a cardboard box, for example, `
`there's a good chance you could have slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` That is also acceptable.`
` By suspecting the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect them."`
`".........Then how was Jessica's room locked?`
` It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key.`
` If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, right...?"`
`"So, in other words, that means suspecting one of you 18 people...!!"`
`"Y, ......you're so nice, thanks.`
` ...I've been able to sort things out a bit. `
`......My goal is to pursue how the 19th person, the human guest Beatrice, committed the crimes.`
` If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you can do that?`
` Foolish man.`
` ......A room like this wasn't a closed room from the beginning.`
` After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."`
`"And there were several who possessed those keys!`
` You can suspect any of them!`
` Suspect as much as you like!!`
` But you went to all the trouble of denying all of those, and made a closed room yourself."`
`".........Understand?`
` This is a closed room born from your mental contradiction.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no one else, you closed that door yourself."`
`"......So you're trying to say that there are two options, `
`...accept that a witch opened it with magic, or accept that someone I know is the culprit.`
` Damn, are you trying to fork the rook!"`
`"So much that I wanted to show you that this move also exists."`
`"......*cackle*.`
` So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?`
` Isn't it actually simple...?`
` Don't you just have to make sacrifices of that overly self-confident cook and that hag who wouldn't be a loss if she died? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............Damn it!! `
`If I suspect Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, everything's fine?!`
` It's useless! `
`.........I can't think of Gohda-san as the culprit!`
` I can't think of Kumasawa-san as the culprit!!`
` But I won't accept you!!`
` Definitely!!"`
`"In that case, they would have to enter the room without using magic or a master key, `
`kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic."`
`"......How could it be done?!`
` How could it be done so that you can deny me and not suspect anyone at the same time?!! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Resign."`
`"Huh?`
` Battler-kun, what did you say?"`
`"......I give up.`
` I was able to prove that Kanon-kun couldn't have locked this door.`
` ......But that doesn't mean I was able to figure out who killed Jessica."`
`"N, ......no, ...that's more than enough...`
` Umm, ......for Kanon-kun's sake, `
`...thank you very much...!"`
`"......No need to thank me.`
` After all, ......that means that Shannon-chan is also under suspicion."`
`".................."`
`"...And sorry, Rosa oba-san.`
` ......It's not like I wanted to resist you.`
` I just don't want to die, so I wanted to find Dad and the rest's true enemy.`
` ......Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative."`
`"......No, it's alright.`
` I was also a little rash.`
` Let's make up.`
` As an aunt and nephew, we have to be friendly with each other.`
` ............Right?"`
`Rosa oba-san shifted the gun to one hand, and held out her other hand.`
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.`
` Oba-san's gaze was sharp.`
`......In order to deny the witch, she would make anyone a sacrifice.`
` ...That's what her eyes told me.`
` And me...? `
`I denied the witch.`
`......But I wasn't prepared to lose anything.`
` I was probably the one most ready to fight, ......and the one most separated from reality.`
