`With Jessica's death, it became certain that that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they would come after our lives if they had a chance.`
` According to Genji-san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.`
` The boat had a radio.`
` We could probably contact the police directly with that.`
` All of us gathered in the parlor, and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.`
` I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,`
` but Rosa oba-san rejected that, saying that if we managed to corner the culprit, or maybe provoke them,`
` it might lead to a third murder.`
`...That was probably the right thing to do.`
` If a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there's no way we'd find anything.`
` It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary, and leave it to the police after tomorrow.`
` We had been tense in the beginning, but other than Rosa oba-san,`
` most of the people had spent all afternoon watching TV and were getting bored, so our sense of danger had grown much less intense.`
` When we thought about it, even though there certainly had been six adults killed at once in the first murder,`
` that made us imagine that some back-handed method like poison had been used.`
` And in the second murder, it was thought that those two had become sacrifices because they were unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.`
` From this, we imagined that the culprit wasn't a large number of adults, `
`and they weren't someone who could kill this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.`
` Right now, in this parlor, George-aniki and I.`
` Maria.`
` Rosa oba-san.`
` Genji-san, Gohda-san, Shannon-san, Kumasawa-san, ......and then, Doctor Nanjo, a total of nine people, were here.`
` Furthermore, Rosa oba-san was even armed with a gun.`
` Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn't be able to touch us easily.`
` That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...`
` By the way, lunchtime had just ended for us.`
` However, it had been a canned food lunch, a far cry from last night's dinner which Gohda-san had skillfully made for us.`
`...Rosa oba-san had also suspected that poison had been used in the murder of those six people.`
`...So, we probably couldn't deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning, and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.`
`......Rosa oba-san ordered all of us that, until the police came, we should not put anything into our mouths except safe foods like canned food.`
` As a cook, Gohda-san must have felt very let down.`
` As though he wanted to display his skill anyway, Gohda-san said that he at least wanted to bring the plates and pile them up with canned food.`
` At first, Rosa oba-san had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn't been able to find anything to complain about,`
` and Gohda's 'Chef's Pick Canned Food Combo Lunch' was born.`
` Gohda-san said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes too.`
`...I see, it's the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it feels like something completely different...`
`"Uu-, Battler.`
` Look, look.`
` This is the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
` Uu-."`
`As I was sitting lazily on the sofa, with no desire to watch TV, `
`Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me as she said that.`
`"......What is that book? `
`'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'?`
` ...............Let's see."`
`'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'.`
` It was a phrase that Rosa oba-san had said this morning when we had gone to call on Jessica.`
`...At the time, I hadn't known what it meant, and then after that, there was the uproar when Jessica's corpse was found, so I'd forgotten about it completely.`
` The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.`
` When I opened it, I realized that it was a book stuffed with riddles.`
`"Uu-.`
` So there's several wolves and sheep, right?`
` It's a puzzle to take them to the other side using one boat."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` I've heard of a game with rules like this.`
` This is the wolves and sheep puzzle?"`
`It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.`
` Let's try posing a question.`
` On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.`
` There is a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.`
` That's the puzzle.`
` There are two rules.`
` The first is regarding the boat.`
` Even a single wolf or a single sheep can paddle it.`
` But it can only hold two animals.`
` The second is regarding the wolves.`
` When they are greater in number than the sheep in that location, they attack the sheep and it's game over.`
` For example, at the start of the game...`
` The two sheep ride the boat, and go to the other side.`
` Then one sheep gets off, and the other goes back to the first bank.`
`......When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank. And a single sheep returns there.`
` When that happens, there are more wolves, so the sheep is attacked and it's game over.`
` On either bank or even the boat, there must not be more wolves than sheep.`
` It's a puzzle about how to shuttle them across in the boat under these conditions.`
` By the way, the right answer is to move both wolves to the opposite bank in the first turn.`
` Then one wolf comes back.`
` On the second turn, you move two sheep to the opposite bank.`
` Then one wolf comes back.`
` Then on the third turn, you put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.`
` Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn't a problem.`
` You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.`
` This book uses wolves and sheep as an example, but lots of people probably know this game with a different example...`
` It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,`
` and she kept showing me different pages, saying 'solve this one' and 'this one's hard'.`
` What had been happening when Rosa oba-san had said the name of this puzzle...`
` That's right.`
`...When we'd decided to call Jessica, we had been talking about how many men should go, `
`and Rosa oba-san had mentioned 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle', saying that we should all go together......`
`"........................Wait a sec..."`
`That could only mean one thing.`
`...Rosa oba-san was saying that there was a wolf among us.`
` And when the number of wolves and sheep was balanced, we were safe, but when a situation came up where that wasn't the case, the wolves bear their fangs, ...is that what she thought......? `
`At the time we had found our parents corpses, Rosa oba-san had already suspected that the servants might be 'wolves'.`
` She had sniffed out the possibility that, while she didn't know whether it was all of them or a group, some 'wolves' were hiding among them.`
`......That's no surprise.`
` That murder scene was very elaborate.`
` It was easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.`
` And because she had reached that conclusion, when we went to Jessica's room, `
`where Jessica had been alone with a servant, Kanon, and had been killed, `
`.........it isn't hard to imagine why Rosa oba-san had suspected the servants so persistently...`
`"All you servants.`
` Gohda-san is going to the kitchen to clean the utensils.`
` Just in case, would you please all go with him?"`
`"My apologies, everyone.`
` Let us go as a group."`
`"......Shannon, Kumasawa.`
` We are going."`
`"Yes, yes, coming.`
` Hoh-hoh-ho."`
`"Well then, George-san, excuse me for now."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Take care. `
`Ah, Rosa oba-san, could I go as well?"`
`"I'm sorry, would you remain here, George-kun?`
` There's something I want to talk to you about."`
`"......Is that so? `
`Sorry, Shannon.`
` Anyway, take care.`
` ...Don't be alone."`
`"...Yes..."`
`"I'm sorry, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I wanted to consult you about something."`
`"Yes, ......what could that be?`
` .................."`
`The servants put the utensils and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.`
` Behind them, Rosa oba-san was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.`
`"...Understood.`
` I will go."`
`"Yes, I am counting on you."`
`Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, stood from the sofa, and followed after the servants...`
` Rosa oba-san stuck her head out into the hallway, and after seeing them leave completely, she closed the door, and spoke.`
`"Everyone, listen.`
` With this, everyone here is an Ushiromiya person."`
`"......Hmm?`
` Yes, that is true..."`
`"So you're saying that you've chased out all of the 'wolves'?`
` ......Rosa oba-san."`
`With that one sentence, Rosa oba-san's gaze grew sharp.`
` ...Apparently she had picked up on the sarcasm.`
`......Rosa oba-san laughed lightly.`
`"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler-kun. `
`I like clever kids.`
` It means there's less to explain."`
`"Uu-.`
` Battler, smart...? `
`Can you solve this?`
` Page 64 is hard.`
` Uu-!"`
`"Maria, watch TV for a while.`
` Mama wants to talk with Battler-kun and George-kun."`
`"...............Uu-."`
`"Rosa oba-san.`
` ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler-kun.`
` ...I don't think it's bad to be very careful, but I think being too suspicious isn't good either."`
`"Whether the real culprit is Beatrice or not, `
`there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in league with her. `
`......In the first murder, where Nii-san and the others were killed,`
` they were treated very brutally, right?`
` Did that look like something that could be done alone?"`
`"............Maybe the mystery guest, Beatrice-sama worked all night, and did it all."`
`"And the case with the master key involving the door to Jessica's room?`
` Isn't that proof that one of the servants was involved?"`
`"......Nn..............."`
`Only the master key could have locked the door to Jessica's room.`
`...In that case, we can only suppose that one of the servants locked it......`
`.........No, `
`......wait.`
`"Turn the chessboard over.`
` ......That's strange, Rosa oba-san."`
`"After killing Jessica, why would the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?`
` Since it was locked, it became inevitable that the owners of the master keys would be suspected.`
` ......There was no need to go to all the trouble of locking the door."`
`"...Th, that's right.`
` It's just as Battler-kun says!`
` There was no need for them to go to all the trouble of making themselves suspicious."`
`"Yes.`
` That's an interesting thought.`
` Of course, I also thought that. `
`......If that's so, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants, and locked that door without a master key.`
` But that's impossible.`
` Right?"`
`......That's right.`
` If there was a trick that could lock the door without a master key, this would be a good disguise aimed at casting doubt on the servants.`
`...If the culprit wanted us to isolate ourselves and attack us one by one, this trick would also be effective at giving rise to paranoia.`
` However, there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...`
`"How can you make the claim that there's no way to lock the door without using a master key?`
` Isn't that a Devil's Proof, like Rudolf nii-san was talking about?`
` Maybe it was locked by a method we can't think of."`
`"Even if we can't think of it, that doesn't mean we can deny that there was some unknown trick."`
`"............That's also true.`
` So is that it?`
` The suspicious ones are guilty...?"`
`"I don't know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.`
` My apologies, but if we supposed that Kanon-kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.`
` Even as to why there was no corpse."`
`"Huh......`
` But Kanon-kun wasn't holding a master key, right?! `
`Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon-kun shouldn't have been able to lock the door!"`
`"......I see.`
` ...So that's why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica's room.`
` ......Rosa oba-san, ...your mind works faster than I could imagine judging by your normal appearance."`
`"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister's minus 1.`
` ...Right now there is no one I need to worry about, so I feel relieved."`
`George-aniki realized that she was referring to Eva oba-san, `
`and seemed a little disturbed about how he should take that sarcasm...`
`"......I, I'm sorry.`
` Could you explain it so that even I can understand? `
`Kanon-kun's master key was in Jessica-chan's pocket, closed up inside a closed room.`
` After the door was locked, it should have been impossible to put it in her pocket from outside the room no matter what trick he used...!"`
`"That's not it, Aniki.`
` ......If it was done in the way Rosa oba-san imagines, ......this trick could only be used by Kanon-kun.`
` ...And, the door could be locked without a key, while the master key was still in Jessica's pocket.`
` ......And, as a result, his corpse would also disappear."`
`"H, ......how?!`
` How would he lock the door without a key?!"`
`"It's simple.`
` George-kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?`
` You twist the knob, *click*, right?"`
`"Huh...?! `
`.........C, `
`...could it be, `
`......no, but, `
`......Kanon-kun wasn't anywhere......"`
`"...It looks like you've got it, Aniki.`
` .........That's what Rosa oba-san was searching inside the room for. `
`......She was searching for Kanon-kun, who had locked the door from the inside, stuck the key in Jessica's pocket,`
` and was hiding somewhere, waiting for us to walk right past him."`
`That was the simplest closed room trick.`
`...It meant he had been hiding inside the closed room after the murder had been committed.`
`...And if he could get out after those who discovered the body left, the closed room murder would work perfectly......`
`"We searched that room, but we didn't find anything.`
` ...But, that doesn't mean we know that the room didn't have something like a secret hidden passage that only the servants know about."`
`"We don't know where that might be hidden, `
`but if we assume that there was a hidden passage, we can make the claim that it was impossible for anyone except him."`
`"...............You know, that line of reasoning, `
`...I also thought that in the very beginning.`
` ......It's the reasoning I hate the most, so I wanted to destroy it in the very beginning..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*... `
`'{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}', right?"`
`"Because you seemed to suspect Kanon as the culprit, you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right away.`
` I understand, I understand.`
` *cackle*......"`
`"...So this is what I thought next.`
` A theory that there were actually three people in that room.`
` Jessica and Kanon-kun were victims.`
` And I thought that the culprit, the guest Beatrice, was also there with them."`
`"You wanted to make it 'the human me' who committed the crime without using magic.`
` I see, a strange theory that fits you perfectly.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"......I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.`
` And you carried Kanon-kun's corpse using some secret method that normal people wouldn't notice.`
` ......In other words, you used a secret door to escape."`
`"But you told me it in red.`
` ...You said that there are no types of hidden doors."`
`"Hmm.`
` No secret passage exists that you all do not know of.`
` Was it Knox, or was it Van Dine?`
` It seems that in mystery novels, there must not be hidden passages, no matter what.`
` I also follow that etiquette."`
`"So even without having to thoroughly search the room, a famous detective could claim that there are no secret passages.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*, playing as human detectives is so easy."`
`"Damn you, talking so big... `
`Thanks.`
` Thanks to the witch's arrangement, I can claim that the room doesn't have a hidden door without searching the whole thing."`
`"Hmm. `
`{p:1:There are no hidden doors in this room}. `
`{p:1:There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows}."`
`"......Which means, `
`...that theory Rosa oba-san's so confident in, `
`......is wrong. `
`...Furthermore, it's annoying, but it's impossible to disprove that theory.`
` If you, the witch, say `
`'`
`{p:1:there are no hidden doors}' in red, then it's settled."`
`"......However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Rosa oba-san probably won't accept it.`
` Humans can't prove there's no hidden door.`
` It's a Devil's Proof.`
` ............Damn.`
` It sure is convenient being a witch..."`
`"......No way!`
` You're calling Kanon-kun the culprit because of a hidden door that we don't know exists...`
` I, ...can't accept that."`
`"You can't accept that, so you'd like to hear some reasoning that is easier to accept? `
`.........There is none.`
` I've been thinking the whole time.`
` There's nothing but this!"`
`"........................"`
`"George-kun, you had a good relationship with Shannon-chan, right?`
` So I think it would be hard for you to accept that all of the servants are the culprits. `
`I also don't want to believe that Shannon-chan is one of the culprits.`
` .........But whether it's all of them or not, the culprit, or maybe an accomplice, is definitely in that group.`
` You must not fail to see that!"`
`"......If you thought that someone other than Kanon-kun was a wolf, `
`...then causing that uproar by saying that Kanon-kun was the culprit in Jessica's room was to see the servants' reactions...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.`
` ......There certainly is a wolf among the servants.`
` Certainly.`
` And, just like the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle', while they are normally docile, they will surely attack if they get the chance."`
`"......Jessica-chan was a lone sheep on the boat.`
` ......In that puzzle, they may not attack when there is a balance between wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.`
` Depending on the opportunity and the number of people, they'll attack even if there is a balance.`
` Just like when Jessica-chan was killed!"`
`".........Th, there's something I don't like!`
` In that case, Shannon, who you had go to the kitchen, is in a dangerous situation, right?!!`
` We should also go to the kitchen right now!`
` No matter who might or might not be a wolf!`
` If we can form a balance by gathering together, I think we should maintain that!!"`
`"......Shannon-chan went to see Father along with Genji-san.`
` At that time, she was supposedly isolated, but she wasn't killed. `
`Because Genji-san wasn't a wolf either?"`
`"......That's wrong!`
` Because they were both wolves!!"`
`"Shannon isn't the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!`
` Even if it's you, Rosa oba-san, I cannot ignore that.`
` I demand that you take back what you just said...!"`
`"...I hate to say this in front of Aniki, but that argument, `
`......feels just like something Eva oba-san would say. `
`If we can't argue back, then you automatically assume that you're right.`
` ......Looks like you can't fight your blood after all, Oba-san."`
`".........Even I don't think of myself as very praiseworthy right now. `
`But guess what? I'm a mother!`
` I would even become a demon to protect Maria's safety.`
` I really wish I could shut myself away somewhere alone with Maria."`
`"......But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.`
` Right now, you are as good as my children.`
` ......Even if you aren't my own children, ...I won't forsake you.`
` .........Definitely."`
`"......Sure, thanks."`
`"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.`
` Always remain where I can see you.`
` I will protect you."`
`"And at the same time, you'll be observing us to make sure we aren't 'wolves'. `
`...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.`
` Can you, Oba-san, prove that you aren't a 'wolf' yourself?"`
`"Yes, I can."`
`"That's a quick answer.`
` How?"`
`"With this.`
` ...This is my proof."`
`Rosa oba-san held up the gun, and pointed the barrel at me.`
` But that was only for an instant.`
` She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.`
`......But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of the gun had felt like an eternity.`
`"...How does that gun prove that you aren't the culprit, Rosa oba-san?"`
`"Think about it.`
` What if I were the culprit?`
` Did you think I would let the once-in-a-lifetime chance I got when the servants left get away? `
`I could just shoot you, *bang*, and think of a fitting excuse later.`
` Something like, Beatrice appeared outside the window and shot you with a gun.`
` I would claim that I fired off a second shot back at her, and throw away two shots worth of empty cartridges."`
`"That's a crazy violent argument, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"`
`"Long ago, there's something Krauss nii-san often said.`
` Might is right.`
` .........I wonder if that's really true?"`
`".........I'm sorry, you two.`
` I've somewhat lost my composure after all these crimes since morning.`
` Since you know how I normally am, right now I must seem inflexible and a little short-tempered. `
`...But understand.`
` I want to protect you from the malicious culprit.`
` I will become a demon to do that.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ......I'm sorry for saying something that's angered you.`
` Battler-kun, George-kun.`
` ...Let's make up."`
`An unsatisfied expression rose to George-aniki's face.`
`...He probably couldn't forgive the damage done to Shannon's honor.`
`...What about me...? `
`Several bits of circumstantial evidence hinted at the servants' participation.`
`......I didn't want to believe that one of them was the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,`
` ...but in the current situation, that was nothing but wishful thinking.`
` Who should I believe? `
`In the first place, who was the culprit? `
`Were there accomplices? `
`If so, how many?!`
`......It seems that I've only been suspecting the people involved.`
`...I had quickly forgotten that 19th person, `
`the guest, Beatrice, who had come yesterday and boldly called herself the Golden Witch.`
` I hadn't actually seen her face.`
` I'd heard that she was like a double of the witch in that portrait,`
` but because I hadn't seen her directly, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't really feel like a 19th person was on this island.`
`...So I had unconsciously been hallucinating that the culprit was one of the 18...`
` Damn it......`
` Come out, Beatrice.`
` If you're the bad guy, then act like the bad guy, and show yourself, laughing in a high-pitched voice and looking down on us.`
` Just like the bad guy in one of those dramas who, even though they are exposed as the culprit, `
`aggressively says 'is there any proof?'`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is there any proof?"`
`"Shut up, no more talking..."`
`There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.`
` It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.`
` Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a soup.`
`......Rosa had suspected that poison might have been added to the food, so they had decided to eat canned food, but it hadn't really been satisfying.`
` But Gohda thought that she was being too careful.`
` So he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those that wanted to drink it.`
` Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.`
` On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should be the one to wash them since he had been the one who wanted the food on plates in the first place,`
` but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.`
` Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set which had many years of experience.`
`...It had still only just begun.`
` And because the opening game of the experienced players had been endlessly refined,`
` it looked like a ceremony where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.`
`"That's a nice aroma...`
` You wouldn't get this from canned food."`
`"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won't be any poison mixed in. `
`I am making enough for everybody, so please, eat.`
` Of course, I will also taste for poison.`
` Please feel secure and eat."`
`"That really is a nice aroma.`
` Gohda-san, the food you cook really is delicious."`
`"It's natural that you can create delicious food if you buy delicious ingredients. `
`......My master taught me that perfecting your ability to make delicious food from whatever is at hand is what makes you a true cook."`
`"That was a good master.`
` Thanks to him, it looks like we can enjoy some truly delicious soup."`
`"......Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."`
`"I'm sure that Rosa-san is also tired after everything that happened this morning.`
` It is only natural."`
`"But thanks to that, we get to drink some soup made from delicious ingredients, hoh-hoh-ho."`
`Rosa had fervently told everyone that they didn't notice the danger they were in, and that they must suspect that poison was mixed in with the food.`
` The atmosphere in this place accepted that, `
`but their hunger wouldn't be overcome by that momentary emotion.`
`"Ironically, it has become a soup that we normally wouldn't be able to savor. `
`I would like to also serve it to everyone in the parlor, but...?"`
`"......Seeing that would violate Rosa-sama's instructions, it would be better to give it up.`
` ......It is alright if only those who want to drink it do so."`
`"Hoh-hoh-hoh-ho.`
` Skillfully taking a breather when no one is looking is also something a servant knows, isn't it."`
`When Kumasawa cackled, Shannon and Gohda also laughed.`
` It seemed that, in an area where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could be very relaxed.`
` Shannon didn't like Gohda's occasional dishonesty,`
` but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked food, `
`nor in his desire that people enjoy his food.`
` So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes, `
`she couldn't really hate him.`
` However, they couldn't have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment that they were spending their time peacefully like this......`
` At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something was being dragged, and then a *thump*.`
` It seemed like the sound made by a servant outside the back door when they were carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,`
` or maybe when a servant was returning from work wearing a raincoat.`
` So after hearing that sound, at first, none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary...`
` But they quickly realized.`
`............In a situation where everyone was either in the kitchen or the parlor, who in the world was at the back door...?! `
`As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.`
`"Wh, ..........who could it be......?"`
`The servants knew the mansion's layout well.`
` So they understood how incomprehensible it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,`
` go all the way around, and come up to this back door.`
` Then was it Kinzo?`
` ...They couldn't imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study, `
`would dash out into the middle of this typhoon and come to the back of the house, where only low class people came in or out.`
`"......Th, `
`......that wasn't, `
`our imagination, was it......?"`
`".............Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...`
`"...Wh, ...who is it......?"`
`As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.`
`......And he checked with his eyes the location of a butcher's knife set in a nearby sink.`
`......He didn't pick it up yet.`
` Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.`
` However, that possibility wasn't possible...`
` There was no response from across the door to Gohda's initial question.`
`...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn't reached through all the wind and rain outside.`
`".........Genji-san."`
`"......Hmm.`
` .........Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."`
`"...Wh, ......who in the world could it be......"`
`Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationary box placed near the chess set.`
`...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for statements of delivery and bills.`
` But it was fundamentally a knife.`
` So the blade on it could injure someone...`
` Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well-practiced manner.`
` Then they both approached the back door, Gohda silently signaling his approval.`
` Gohda cautiously approached the back door, .........and slowly started to open it......`
`"Wa, wahyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
`The shadow of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.`
` Gohda fell backwards onto his backside and couldn't get up.`
` That human shadow was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...`
`"K, ............Kanon-kun?!`
` Kanon-kun!!"`
`".........Kanon.`
` Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`It was Kanon.`
`......His breath was feeble, ......and the puddles of mud he left quickly became drenched bright-red.`
` When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome scar right in the center of his chest, as though a spear or something had been stuck there.`
` Even now, deep-red blood poured out from there...!`
`"Th, th th...this is horrible...`
` Wh, what shall we do, first aid kit? First aid kit?!"`
`"Kanon-kun, put your hand against the wound!`
` Please, push firmly! `
`Let's carry him to the bed in the servant room!!`
` Everyone, please, lend a hand."`
`"C, come now, Kanon-san!`
` Please, hang in there a little longer...!"`
`"Hang in there!!`
` It's alright now!!`
` So don't take your hand from the wound...!!"`
`"Anyway, let's carry him to the servant room.`
` ......Kumasawa, inform Rosa-sama that we have found Kanon."`
`"W, .........wait.........`
`......not, `
`.........to Rosa-sama........."`
`"...Please wait!`
` Kanon-san said not..., to Rosa-sama..."`
`"......Wh, what do you mean, Kanon-kun...!"`
`"............It's alright for now.`
` Let us quickly carry him to the servant room. `
`Kumasawa, do not tell Rosa-sama yet.`
` ...We will do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."`
`"Y, ......yes......`
`......hiiiiiiii..."`
`After appearing in this horrible state, he had said not to tell Rosa.`
`......That could only mean something very disquieting.`
`......An eerie impatience rose to their faces...`
`"C, come now, everyone!`
` Let's hurry and carry him...!`
` Quickly, quickly...!"`
`Kanon's wound was unbelievably deep,`
` ...and judging from Nanjo's pale face, it was almost a miracle that he was still conscious...`
`"......This is......horrible...`
` It appears that he has been stabbed with something like a spear.`
` I, If it hasn't reached the lungs, I might be able to do something......`
` Anyway, stop the bleeding......!"`
`"u, guo......, aaaaga!!!"`
`No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing deep-red blood, ...he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it all away...!`
` And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...`
`"Kanon-kun, Kanon-kun Kanon-kun!`
` Hang in there..., hang in there...!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` A new towel...! `
`...How, horrible...!!"`
`"What is his condition...?"`
`".........In all honesty, ...it is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...`
` Maybe the location of the stab was fortunate...`
` But the blood loss is too horrible...!`
` A blood transfusion is necessary, but that's impossible until tomorrow...!"`
`"......u, `
`......*cough*cough*!!`
` R, `
`......Rosa-sama, `
`......to us......, `
`ugaaaaaa!!"`
`"D, don't talk, Kanon-kun!`
` Your wound will open...!"`
`"......Rosa-sama, came, `
`.........t, `
`......to Milady, `
`......and me........."`
`"Wh, ......what did you say......"`
`"Rosa-sama, ......did...?`
` Ooooooh..., could that mean, could that mean..."`
`"......Are you certain?"`
`"Yes.........`
`......I'm certain, ......it was Rosa-sama........."`
`"Come now, don't speak any more...! `
`Kumasawa-san, please grab another first aid kit!"`
`".........Genji-san.`
` ......Is it possible, Rosa-sama, ......did such a thing?"`
`"............I do not know."`
`Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...`
`......Because if what Kanon had said was the truth, `
`......Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.`
`"Curse you, Rosa......`
` How could you, to Milady......`
`...I'll kill you..., I WILL KILL YOU......, UGUGUGUGU...!"`
`Kanon screamed even more hatefully...`
`...His hate-filled voice made it seem like he was seeing Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.`
`"......C, certainly, Rosa-sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.`
` If everyone in the Ushiromiya family were destroyed, the inheritance would all go to Rosa-sama..."`
`"If so, Battler-sama and George-sama are in danger...!`
` Not only is Rosa-sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the lounge...!`
` Genji-san, isn't this quite perilous......!"`
`"........................"`
`"........................"`
`Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.`
`...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn't know what to believe...`
` Shannon ran.`
` To where?`
`......The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so it probably wouldn't be easy to find.`
` She might find it if she searched the rose garden, but she would probably lose it all in this wind and rain...`
` That's right, ......the boiler room isn't cleaned very often.`
`...If she went there, ......she might be able to find it...`
` Shannon ran downstairs to find that in the underground boiler room...`
` Did some medicine take effect at the brink of death, `
`or had Kanon finally stopped even feeling pain?`
`...For the time being, Kanon had at least gotten over his painful gasping.`
` Nanjo apparently didn't think of this as that great of a trend, and didn't let his eyes off Kanon for a second.`
` Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon's hand, and kept encouraging him so that the willpower keeping him alive didn't fall asleep.`
` Genji and Gohda seemed bewildered at the truth that Kanon had risked his life to deliver...`
`".........Rosa-sama's gun surely has four or five shots loaded."`
`"That is no small number.`
` ...But loading cartridges into a Winchester should require quite a lot of practice.`
` She might be able to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."`
`".........On this island, while there is a doctor, there is no medicine, and no hospital.`
` ......If the location where the shot hits is bad, that person will die."`
`"I understand that, but...`
` More importantly, if we don't move quickly, there is also the possibility that another crime will occur...!`
` I get the feeling that Rosa-sama skillfully chased us out.`
` There is a possibility that George-sama and Battler-sama are being killed right about now...!"`
`"........................"`
`"......Ho, ...hohohohoho.`
` If the opponent is so dangerous, wouldn't it be better if we didn't provoke them too much...?"`
`"But there is still much time before tomorrow comes...!`
` We can't even imagine what strategy she will use! `
`Genji-san, we should wage war from here.`
` If we can at least steal the gun under some pretext, things might work out...!"`
`"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?`
` That means there aren't enough to kill all of us...`
` If we don't carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa-sama wouldn't be unreasonable..."`
`"............No, she said it. `
`She said she'll massacre all of us."`
`Kanon, who they thought had been sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.`
` Almost like he had been awake the whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.`
` He looked firm and steady, and Nanjo was slightly relieved, but thinking of the deepness of that wound, he just couldn't wipe away a certain creepy feeling.`
`......He knew because he was a doctor.`
` It wouldn't have been unexpected if Kanon had lost consciousness after losing so much blood.`
` And yet somehow, he had preserved his awareness so clearly.`
`......Was it youth?`
` Or was it tenacity?`
`...Sometimes, the power of human life surpassed common knowledge......`
` When they had stopped the bleeding, Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, to make sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area, `
`and the great depth of the wound had surprised him.`
`...The wound had certainly reached as far as his lungs.`
`......And yet, ...and yet...`
`......No, on the other hand, the fact that he is alive is fortunate...`
`......But Kanon had spoken clearly.`
`...He had hatefully said that the one named Rosa had created this wound, and was repeating curses and enraged words.`
`"...That person wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master's wealth all to herself.`
` She told me that clearly."`
`".........Damn...!`
` What a person...`
` Genji-san, what should we do?!`
` Are there any weapons we can..."`
`"......I cannot believe it so suddenly.`
` ......That Rosa-sama would do something like......"`
`"Genji-sama, it isn't a question of whether you believe or not.`
` That person told me.`
` I heard it. `
`WHY won't you believe me?"`
`"D, don't get up...`
` You'll harm your wound..."`
`Kanon sat up on the bed, speaking to Genji, who made no effort to believe Kanon's story.`
`"That person will definitely kill all of us.`
` She's surely killed all of the people in the parlor by now.`
` If we don't kill her first, we'll definitely be killed first.`
` Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.`
` Kill or be killed.`
` Kill or be killed kill or be killed."`
`"...K, .........Kanon-san, ......you, `
`......does it really not hurt...?"`
`"......Oh, this?`
` It isn't a serious wound."`
`"Wh..., what do you mean, not a serious wound, ...you......"`
`"It really isn't a big deal.`
` Something like this won't hurt anymore, it really isn't a serious wound."`
`As Kanon said that, he began to untie the bandages which had been painstakingly wrapped...`
` The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...`
`"K, Kanon-san...!`
` You must not do something like that!`
` Quickly, lie down...!"`
`"I said it's fine.`
` ......Hey. `
`See...?`
` It is, not a serious wound, right...?"`
`Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.`
`...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.`
`"Look, I told you that it wasn't a serious wound at all..."`
`"S, ......stop..., you must not play with your wound......"`
`"...Hey, see? `
`......It isn't, a deep wound. `
`.........Look. `
`............Look."`
`Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...`
`......Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.`
` The finger, went in deep, to the base...`
`......*squish*, *gloop*, *bloop*...`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!! `
`K K K, Kanon-san, stop it, stop it...!!"`
`That finger was completely sticking into his chest, ......up to its base,`
` ......and then he slowly pulled it out in exactly the same way...`
` The fingers he pulled out, were stained a sticky, solid, deep-red color, and there was even a thread hanging...`
`...The finger was, up to its base, covered, ......in deep-red...`
`"......Y, `
`.........you, `
`......wh, wh wh, what in the world..............."`
`".........See?`
` It is, not a serious wound, at all, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`At that time, the door was opened vigorously, and Shannon appeared.`
`...Even after she saw Kanon, stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn't falter.`
`"......Hey, Nee-san.`
` Where'd you go?`
` I'm on the verge of death here, where'd you go?"`
`"Yes.`
` I went to the boiler room.`
` There was something I had to find.`
` ......More importantly, I want to check. `
`Are you really, ...Kanon-kun?"`
`"......Huh, ......eeeh...?"`
`It was only natural.`
` Everyone believed he was Kanon.`
` So they couldn't understand the meaning of Shannon's question.`
` When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.`
` It was filthy, and looked like it had wiped up some trash or dust.`
` And while holding that, she approached Kanon, .........drew closer to his feet.`
`"What is that......?"`
`"It's a handkerchief with a spider's web wiped onto it."`
`"...............`
`...Why something like that?"`
`"If you're Kanon-kun, you should be alright.`
` But if spiders are your natural enemy, I thought you might hate it."`
`"...............`
` Hahaha, oh no.`
` Why would I hate spiders?"`
`"Sorry, I'll try it."`
`"......Sh, ...Shannon-san."`
`When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon's thigh, ......something happened in an instant.`
` It happened all at once.`
` The human eye couldn't have followed it.`
` Kanon jumped like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.`
` Then, from his arm, some kind of afterglow flashed purple and drew a locus.`
` That arc, which drew three beautiful purple loci, traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.`
` And, in an instant, Nanjo and Kumasawa's throats, ......opened like gaping mouths, ...and from then on, the blood really started spewing out.`
` The third purple locus should have traced across Shannon's throat.`
` But Shannon wasn't there.`
` Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon's neck and pulled her back.`
` This all happened in an instant.`
`"..................!!!"`
`In the instant Gohda tried to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.`
` Blood was spewing forcefully from Nanjo and Kumasawa's necks, which had been torn open.`
` Kanon jumped and kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat, and aiming for Shannon's throat again.`
` But Kanon's target once again disappeared from in front of him.`
` Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen onto the ground as though hiding.`
`"Nice reflexes, you senile old furniture!!"`
`"......Gohda!"`
`"O, ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda wasn't an idiot either.`
` Even if he couldn't fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this 'Kanon' wasn't seized, his own life would also be in peril.`
` He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with his weight and physical strength.`
`"Ooooooooooooooooooohhh...! Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"L, et...go, you fatass!!"`
`Another purple locus was drawn from the tips of the fingers on Kanon's right hand.`
` And when he raised that hand like a sword, aiming at Gohda's back, there was a loud *thunk*.`
` Because Kanon's raised hand had been pinned in the wall.`
` He couldn't tear his palm away from the wall.`
` Sticking out from it, was the knife Genji had thrown.`
` Under normal circumstances, it should have been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,`
` but in this abnormal space, no one payed it much mind.`
`"Genji-sama, here...!"`
`"......Hmm."`
`Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.`
` And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda's massive body and the knife.`
`"St...op it...!! `
`Don't bri, bring that close...!! `
`Stop it, st, op!! `
`Gyaooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`When Genji pushed the handkerchief up to Kanon's face, `
`...there was a sound just like the one you hear when you set meat on a red-hot iron plate.`
` Of course, the smell was the same too.`
` As he was burned and inflamed, festering in filthy red and black, and cried out in his death throes, Kanon's body burst open and scattered.`
` It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.`
` The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf, ......no, a group of gold butterflies...`
` Those butterflies began to softly fade into nothingness, as though water, no, as though the air itself was evaporating,`
` ......and afterwards, all that was left was the three of them sitting on their butts, stained with blood.`
` However, not everyone was just stained with blood.`
` Some of them were lying on the ground, vomiting blood themselves.`
`"...Kumasawa...!`
` ......Doctor Nanjo...!`
` .................."`
`A slit so sharp that it looked like it could cut your finger if you touched it opened wide, causing large amounts of blood to keep pouring out...`
`"What was that, .........j, ...just now............"`
`"....................."`
`".........Gohda.`
` Have you been injured?"`
`"I, I am alright... `
`But, .........what did we see?!`
` What happened?!`
` E, ev- ev-, ......even though I definitely pushed that against this wall with this hand! `
`I cannot understand what happened...!!"`
`Gohda looked at his own hand.`
` The bright-red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon, definitely remained.`
`...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.`
` Because he had disappeared.`
` He had turned into gold butterflies and scattered.`
` Gohda kept screaming alone, without a clue about what was going on.`
` Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo's and Kumasawa's remains,`
` ...as Genji watched over her, silent as always...`
